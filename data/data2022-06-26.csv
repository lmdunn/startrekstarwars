It captures everything that makes Star Trek unique while still managing to have its own voice with creative new concepts. But it also has done well at coming back to established lore to add more context to elements of Trek that have only been briefly touched on.

The Gorn comes to mind, as does Sybok (though we will need to see what they do with him).

But what other neglected parts of canon would you like to see get more attention?

If for some reason, the crew was able to evacuate and separate the saucer section from the warp section and go full impulse well before the warp core exploded, once being met by other ships or somehow making it back to earth solely on impulse; would the Enterprise D have been rebuilt and repaired, or scrapped completely with the loss of the other half of the ship and be subsequently replaced by the Enterprise E?

1656119882,"Just wanted to mention that Babs Olusanmokun has done such a great job as Doctor M'Benga thus far. In ""The Elysian Kingdom"" he carried the episode as the leading man and his acting at the end made me tear up a bit. He didn't say much, but the emotions he conveyed with his face and eyes and body language seemed so real.

While I didn't get quite as emotional as I did with ""The Visitor"" or ""Inner Light,"" I think this episode could end up being mentioned alongside those tearjerkers in the future. I think the emotional catharsis is still there, but since the majority of the episode is light-hearted and comedic we have a bit of an emotional cushion if you will (compared to watching Jake try to save Benjamin and ruin his own life for 50+ years.) What a fantastic episode.

Also, honorable mention to the fly-fishing scene. Everyone else on the station was running around trying to solve their problems and here's Doctor M'Benga just enjoying the moment and not saying a single word. Plus he wore his silly hat.

I also hope that he has a bit part in Dune: Part 2 because I'd like to see him play Jamis again.",startrek,Babs Olusanmokun (Doctor M'Benga) is fantastic in SNW

This just has the feel of Trek that I loved (TNG era), but still with a modern sensibility without succumbing to the myriad pitfalls of other new Trek (no need to re-list them here, we all know the issues). 

I'm enjoying it SO MUCH. Great characters I already connect with, good writing and lovely done one stories. I don't know who the driving force was behind the feel and direction of the show, but it's pitch perfect for us old bastards.

\-K'Ehleyr, while still an ambassador, lives on the Enterprise full time with Worf and her son

\-Worf does goes to serve for the Klingon Empire during two parter Redemption and K'Ehleyr knows Worf needs to do this for their people, tells K'Ehleyr she needs to stay behind with Alexander on the Enterprise.

1656058180,"I was in late season 6 when the Netflix banner ""Last day to watch: July 1st"" popped up (I'm in the US). I've been racing against the clock to get through everything ahead of the deadline.

It's really sad to me, because DS9 is honestly my favorite Star Trek series so far. I started with TOS, then TNG, now DS9, and I just love the darker, non-utopian tone, the political intrigue, and the large cast of supporting characters that keep coming back, all making the world that much richer.

I've rushed through &gt;!Jadzia's death,  which I already had spoiled and was super sad!&lt;, and have made my way through S7E17. Now I see ahead of me an 8-part series of episodes (!!!) and then a double length finale. So it feels like I'm on the tipping point of the end of this series, and it's really sad. I feel like I haven't had enough time with newer characters (why couldn't there be more episodes with Vic??) and the older ones still have so much left to give. I don't see how the rest of the loose ends with the &gt;!Dominion, the pact with the Romulans, the Founders' disease, the wormhole aliens and pah wraiths, Section 31!&lt;, and everything else can get resolved in this amount of time.

I know this is all normal series-end melancholy, but I just wanted to share the feeling and express my hope that other series will match up to DS9.

(And yeah, I've started buying blurays and DVDs of the shows. Not going to rely on some stupid streaming platform if I want to rewatch things in the future. And I'd love to avoid paramount plus for the new stuff, even though it's probably impossible.)",startrek,Racing against the Netflix clock with DS9

However, when the game entered publication the license only covered the television series from TOS to ENT; no movies, no Kelvin stuff, and no new Trek. They've since renegotiated, and now are able to produce material for Disco and PIC as well.

So far that's meant three packs of official character sheets for the first three seasons of Disco, and now this campaign guide covering the first two seasons, which became available in PDF last week, and I am just reading now for the first time. So, much like with the [Shackleton Expanse Campaign Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/pqcvls/first_impressions_of_the_star_trek_adventures/) when that came out, I'm just going to flip around the book and see what's interesting.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Player Options**

Even thought I'm almost always the gamemaster, I do check out player options first any time a get a new book.

There's a few new species options here, which is always cool.

 ‚Ä¢ Barzan: It's always interesting when we get a new player species that has had very little on screen representation, because it's just the writers cobbling together ideas from hints and beta canon.

The Barzan have access to an talent that lets them potentially substitute a piece of gear for one they don't have access to, and it makes me wonder if I'm perhaps to lenient in my games where I allow the players to basically do that anyways with a half convincing argument.

 ‚Ä¢ Kelpien: I made a homebrew Kelpien species back during Disco season one, and updated them for season two, so having an official version is nice. I will admit that this one is a bit more streamlined then my own. Though I do think the Threat Ganglia talent should be required as opposed to just optional, and would probably house rule it as such.

 ‚Ä¢ Osnullus: Another species where all the information is entirely made up seeing as we know nothing about them other than the fact that they occasionally show up in the background aboard Discovery.

Of their two optional talents, I really like the one that allows them to get automatic re-rolls in a single discipline; that's really strong. The other option is to make it difficult to be caught in a lie because their faces are unreadable, which isn't particularly exciting, and is probably something I would argue could be covered by their trait.

 ‚Ä¢ Xahean: Another species I've written a homebrew version of, and I like mine better. Though other than a few minor differences they're pretty similar, so this once certainly isn't bad.

I'm not sure the Camouflage Field talent accurately represents what we see Po do in 'The Runaway', but I suppose there are game balance elements to consider.

 ‚Ä¢ Saurian: I don't have much to comment on. The seem perfectly fine, and it's nice to have a species introduced in TMP added to the game.

 ‚Ä¢ Cybernetically Enhanced: Not technically a species in and of itself, but a template that gets combined with another species, like mixed species characters, or the Liberated Borg added in earlier supplements.

The write-up makes me assume Airiam was the inspiration for the template, but the character in the artwork looks more like Detmer's situation, but the rules for a character like Detmer already exist in the core rulebook. The stat blocks from the Disco character packs confirms that Airiam is what they had in mind.

Anyways, the Synthetic Physiology talent doesn't seem particularly interesting, but I really like the Analytical Recall talent, which allows the character to just ask the GM questions and get answers without having to spend the resources normally used for that.

 ‚Ä¢ There is a brief sidebar on playing Ba'ul characters in a later chapter, but they don't get a full write-up.

 ‚Ä¢ Terran characters also get a sidebar in the Terran Empire chapter, but it essentially boils down to how not every Terran is evil.

&amp;nbsp;  
There are rules here for Klingon characters to undergo the procedure that Ash Tyler and Arne Darvin did. I can't remember off hand if these rules are in the Klingon core rulebook as well, but even if they are it makes sense to have them here.

&amp;nbsp;
There's some cool new gear options. Specifically the device that Burnham and Tyler use to mask their Human life signs when they're aboard the Ship of the Dead, Georgiou's special S31 gear when she's on Qo'noS in season two, and some Terran Empire specific gear. There's also Reno's drones from the Hiawatha.

The tactical vests seem kind of expensive considering how ubiquitous they are on away missions. I think I would have preferred something less useful, but also less resource intensive. (Like the homebrew version I made)

&amp;nbsp;  
**SHIPS!**

So, my biggest frustration with Disco is how the ships are supposed to be so much larger than previous iterations of Trek, and how do you reconcile that? The STA answer seems to be to just ignore it.

For anyone unfamiliar with STA, all starships have a stat called Scale, which is not solely about how large the ship is, but that's certainly a factor. Shuttles and runabouts are scale 1 and 2 respectively, and once you get up to the Defiant or Nova-class ships you're at scale 3. Based on their relative size, you would expect the smallest Disco starships to be scale 4, with the Discovery itself being scale 6. Smartly I think, the writers of the book have all the Starfleet ships at scale 3 or 4, which keeps them in line with other ships specific to that era, and saves me a lot of homebrew edits.

Anyways, it looks like all the Starfleet ships introduced in the first two seasons of the show are here, including the Hiawatha-class, and the various Section 31/Starfleet Intelligence ships from season two.

Regarding the Crossfield-class, the book claims there were only ever three ships of the class commissioned, the Discovery, the Glenn, and the Crossfield, and suggests that if GMs/players wanted to use the Crossfield that it not include the spore drive. Which makes sense considering we know the Glenn and the Discovery were the two ships the drive was being tested on. There are rules for using the spore drive though, in an earlier chapter discussing integrating the mycellial network into a game.

The section in Klingon ships includes some lore about how most of the ship designs are actually salvaged Hur'q vessels repurposed after the Klingons cast the Hur'q off Qo'noS. I suppose that's as good an explanation as any for why the Disco Klingon ships look so different from what we're familiar with, though personally I wasn't too concerned about it. Strangely enough, the book implies the Klingon invisibility screens were also based on reverse engineered Hur'q technology at one point, but in another says they were acquired from the Romulans. Seems like an editor should have caught that discrepancy.

Like the Starfleet ships, the Klingon ships have been reigned in. The Ship of the Dead is scale 6, and there are a couple scale fives, but the rest are all 3 or 4. I actually think the Qugh-class destroyer should be scale 5 based on its relative size, but for some reason it's listed as a 3. I assume they were cut for space, but the Veqlargh and Qow-class spaceframes were not included.

We also get stats for the Ba'ul fighters, and the Terran Empire's throneship, the Charon.

No stats for the Ba'ul patrol ships, the Class C shuttlecraft, the Starfleet landers, the Starfleet tactical flyers, the Vulcan cruiser, or the Klingon raiders.

I do like the option of including DOTs as a starship talent. The other starship talent that caught my eye is Specialized Crew, and that's because there doesn't seem to be any benefit to it, so I don't know why anyone would choose waste one of the very limited available slots on it.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Gamemaster Specific Stuff**

As always, there is a lot of lore for gamemasters to build their campaigns around, most of it surrounding the Federation-Klingon War, and the ""Red Angel Crisis"". There's lots of information about Klingon Houses, which would be very useful for a Klingon campaign set during this time, or for a Federation campaign that was getting in deep with the Federation-Klingon War.

The suggestions for the Red Angel Crisis seem less useful. Most of it seems like it would be stepping on the Discovery's toes, so to speak, and personally I've never really wanted to run or play in a game that was basically just retreading an established story.

There's a whole chapter on the Terran Empire.

Other information includes what's going on with the Romulan Star Empire, as well as the Cardassians, the Tholians, Orions, and some others.

&amp;nbsp;  
Chapter 8 is Allies and Adversaries; stats for major and minor NPCs, and it's strange to see who they choose. Admiral Cornwell, Sarek, Amanda, and Leland for the Federation; Control and its minions; T'Kuvma, Kol, and Tanavik on the Klingon side of things; Gabrielle Burnham, Mudd along with Mudd's android duplicates from 'The Escape Artist', Po, Saru's sister Siranna, then the Ba'ul, and the Pahvans round things out.

No L'Rell, and no Emperor Gerogiou, though both of them are available in the separate character packs Modiphius also published. I'm also surprised that jahSepp aren't included. Ujilli, Dennas, and Kol-Sha would be useful, as would admiral Terral.

There are stats for gromaganders and tardigrades, though the tardigrade seems relatively weak considering how dangerous it was on the show. Also, I kinda wish they'd went with the tie-in novel, *Dead Endless*' interpretation of the tardigrade as being a sentient, multi-dimensional being named Ephraim.

&amp;nbsp;  
Finally, there's a short pre-made campaign set ""during the darkest days of the Federation-Klingon war"" after the Discovery has disappeared to the Mirror Universe. I haven't looked at that much in depth, but I am intrigued.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Odds &amp; Ends**

One thing I want to call out is the book is a pleasure to look through. In their effort of capture the look of the source material, I find that some of the STA stuff can be hard on the eyes, specifically works set during the TOS era, or the Klingon specific supplements. This though is really easy to look at, even in PDF format.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Artwork**

STA books often have some really nice, fun art. Unfortunately that is one aspect of the Disco campaign book that is a bit lacking, comparatively. There's still some good stuff in here though, including a few bits I want to call out specifically.

Interior Front Cover - There is a two page map of the Federation Klingon border, which I believe is taken directly from the show. Nice to get a legible version of that.

pg. 45 - Image of the Battle of the Binary Stars. The artist for this one did a really nice job.

pg. 49 - Not my favourite bit of art in the book, but there are some Disco Klingons wielding slightly more TNG style bat'laths, as well as a Starfleet officer absolutely decking a Klingon.

pg. 205 - There's a nice render of the Enterprise. It's just against a black field, not doing anything, but man, I really do like the Disco/SNW iteration of the Constitution-class.",startrek,First Impressions of the Star Trek Adventures: Discovery Campaign Guide

It sounds silly, but I do feel a bit heartbroken somehow. It's been a favorite show ever since I first watched TOS from VHS tapes at the library. Next Gen got me through high school, DS9 and Voyager through college. 

From Spock to Data, Kirk to Picard, Worf to Tuvok, all the characters are close to my heart and their stories helped me build the character of the person I am today. It's hard for me to know she looks at it the way she does. 

She basically feels that it isn't diverse and the storylines about women are dated and clearly written by men. I think they are both valid arguments in many ways... But it's also hard because she's only seen TOS and the first 4 seasons of Next Gen. And I think if she watched the later seasons and all series, she might appreciate it more?

But maybe that's just my own love talking haha I guess I'm just venting but I wonder if anyone else is dealing with these problems. I don't really know if there's a solution other than letting go of hopes she'll ever love the show.

 This is the subconscious racism  that POC fans talk about. How it is so  easy for the white blonde girl to be easily favoured. Why are mant fans so obsessed with Nurse Chapel calling her the breakout star. Nurse Chapel is the classic example of white privilege  and how the blonde white girl don't have to do much but fans will love them anyway. 

 I can't wait when  SNW begins to match up more with TOS and the Kelvin films. I hope Spock gets with Uhura later on on the show. As I preferred the dynamic more of Spock/Uhura in TOS episodes like Charlie X.

I think it is ironic about people saying how hot chapel is even though in TOS, Spock finds Uhura very beautiful. Cant remember him thinking the same about Chapel. 

***Spock to Uhura in TOS: ''Uhura whose name means freedom, she walks in beauty like the night''***

But back to Chapel, I am glad they are addressing her ties to Spock so early in the series, this means by season 3 or late season 2, Spock should be moving on to Uhura as his love interest. While Chapel should be with Roger Koby.

I'm rambling a bit here, all I want to say is that Iconians should've been more than a dead race with some very dangerous technology (during the TNG Era).

1655755319,"This might be an unpopular opinion (more so regarding the latter) but I have been loving the TNG movies lately.

First Contact is well liked by both fans and critics and even regarded by a lot of people as the best Trek movie ever. The dialogue and story are very strong which makes the movie highly entertaining. It's packed with action that feature the Borg (greatest Star Trek antagonist) and visual effects that surprisingly hold up. In my opinion, First Contact is not only one of the best Star Trek films but one of the best Sci-Fi movies.

Okay here comes the most controversial opinion...I love Insurrection. I know there is a ton of criticism of the plot and how it feels like an extended episode of TNG but it works so well. The humour and scenes on the Ba'ku planet make for a lighter watch compared to the dark tones in First Contact. The movie is a slow burn but I think it really picks up in the last 40 minutes and includes some fun action and battle scenes.

I had bought it shortly after playing Elite Force and its expansion pack, where you could explore nearly all of Voyager‚Äôs decks. Before buying DS9 The Fallen I remember seeing some screenshots that showcased some locations on DS9 that the developers had built ‚Äì but for some reason than excluded from the final version of the game.

Does anyone have any insight or knows somebody who was involved in the production of this game? I would love to know what happened to these levels/maps or why they were excluded. It‚Äôs an unreal engine game ‚Äì so I was able to look through all maps with the included level editor. The maps follow (like other unreal games at that time) a numerical order of = M01 (for mission 1) to M11 (= mission 11). Interestingly M02 as well as M08, M09 are missing. I guess I should have contacted the developers in 2000, when the games website was active but at that time I didn‚Äôt think of that option. ;-P

In the game you can visit ops, the promenade, computer core and some parts of the outer docking ring (ore processing). According to the screenshots I found they had also included parts of the habitat ring and even the runabout hangar.

1655652525,"Captain Pike sat at a table, with a glass in hand.  Relaxing.  Across the table sat a Jex, elegant in a loose-fitting silken tunic and her own body‚Äôs soft fur.  She also held a glass, and daintily dipped her slender muzzle to lap from it.  Her enormous ears, fringed with feathers, swiveled lightly, always alert.

Pike said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt thank you enough for your help sorting out that temporal rift.  But, if what you‚Äôve told us is all true. . .  I have some questions I‚Äôd love to ask about time travel.‚Äù

The Jex shrugged lightly and smiled.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind.  I‚Äôm sure you understand I‚Äôm not going to hand you the blueprints for a time machine.  But I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs what you were going to ask about.‚Äù

Pike chuckled.  ‚ÄúNothing like that.  It‚Äôs more of a personal matter, in fact.‚Äù  His face became more serious, and he leaned forward and confided, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to Boreth.  I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard of Boreth, but I had a vision of my future.  I saw a warp reactor accident on board a starship.  The radiation doesn‚Äôt kill me, but in some ways it‚Äôs worse.  I saw it leaving me severely disabled and disfigured.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow grim!‚Äù commented the Jex, coolly.  ‚ÄúGo on. . .‚Äù  Her ears showed he had her full attention.

Pike glanced down, clasped his hands together.  ‚ÄúThe visions people have at Boreth, they always come true.  It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre written in stone.  But you. . .  Your people travel through time as casually as we fly through space.  Can you change the past and alter the future?  Avert the accident entirely?‚Äù

The Jex blinked and leaned back.  ‚ÄúOh.  That is complicated, and your language is poorly suited to even discuss such matters.‚Äù

Pike pressed, ‚ÄúThen un-complicate it for me!  Yes or no, even?‚Äù

The Jex pulled her fluffy tail around into her lap and scratched thoughtfully with blunt claws.  She said, ‚ÄúVery well, I will try to explain.   Any civilization that discovers time travel experiences a moment of giddiness, exhilaration‚Äîalong with terror.  This is the ultimate superpower, you will say.  I can be like a god, shaping reality to my whims, you will say.  And then, as you learn more details about how it actually works, you learn that time travel is not all that.  It‚Äôs not entirely pointless, it has some uses, but not anything like what you imagined.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt change things?‚Äù

‚ÄúChange isn‚Äôt even the right word.  Your language. . .  What you call time travel is really all about alternate dimensions.  Let‚Äôs imagine that I went back into the history of your world (which I have studied a bit, by the way), and I killed baby Hitler.  Then I averted all of your Second World War.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Europe,‚Äù Pike interjected.  ‚ÄúThe Second World War started with Japan and China.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh!  I guess I didn‚Äôt study your history in sufficient depth.  But the point is still valid.  The war in Europe could be averted, or at any rate would take a much different course without Hitler‚Äôs presence.  Are you with me so far?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.  You changed history.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes and no.  I created a timeline, accessed an alternate reality.  It‚Äôs an independent spacetime continuum, extending infinitely in all directions.  Meanwhile, this timeline would still be here, and the carnage of that war as you remember it would still be just as real in this continuum.‚Äù

Pike scratched his chin and pondered.  ‚ÄúYou could create an alternate timeline where the radiation accident doesn‚Äôt happen, but my fate would still be sealed in this timeline.  But wait. . .  What if you took me out of this timeline completely?  What if you took me in your time machine to that other spacetime continuum?  Then it would be absolutely impossible for me to be caught in the accident in this one, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

The Jex shrugged.  ‚ÄúSure, I could do that.  But I‚Äôm not going to.‚Äù

Pike blinked.  ‚ÄúMay I ask why not?  I mean, I understand that you don‚Äôt owe me anything.‚Äù

The Jex‚Äôs ears drooped slightly.  ‚ÄúLet me answer with a question of my own.  Why don‚Äôt you simply leave Starfleet?  Resign your commission and never look back.  Go find a new life.  Become an artist, or a beach bum, far away from any warp reactors.  What‚Äôs stopping you?‚Äù

He shook his head.  ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt work.  People who‚Äôve been to Boreth have tried to avoid their fate.  Something would happen, some bizarre circumstance would bring me back.‚Äù

She shook her head, mimicking his gesture.  ‚ÄúNo it wouldn‚Äôt.  Causality doesn‚Äôt work like that.  Those other people who you‚Äôve heard tried to avoid their fate: how hard did they really try?  How hard would you try, how far would you go?  But you haven‚Äôt done anything yet.  You could quit Starfleet, but you aren‚Äôt going to.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?  And why am I not going to?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYou tell me!  It‚Äôs your decision, after all.  But I suspect if you were going to make that decision, Boreth wouldn‚Äôt have shown you the vision that it did in the first place.  It showed you what you‚Äôre going to decide to do, not what you‚Äôre going to decide against.‚Äù

Pike was silent for a moment, brooding on that.  But the Jex took the opportunity to add, ‚ÄúOf course all this assumes that your vision at Boreth was a direct look into your future in this reality.  Who knows?  It could simply be a forecast, a prediction.  Maybe it‚Äôs a psychological trick.  Maybe people who see the visions find them so compelling, they can‚Äôt mentally bring themselves to avoid a fate that they already believe is real.‚Äù

Pike brightened up a little.  ‚ÄúThen what?  All I need to do is believe that I can change it?‚Äù

The Jex chuckled lightly.  ‚ÄúSomething like that.  But that‚Äôs true in either case, isn‚Äôt it?  There‚Äôs no point asking for intervention from time travelers, or from the fates, or gods, or anyone else.  *It‚Äôs all on you.‚Äù*",startrek,Captain Pike and a conversation about fate

1655530003,"Admiral Marcus From ‚ÄúStar Trek Into Darkness‚Äù ‚Äì Cinema‚Äôs Most Underrated Villain

I‚Äôd like to make a case for a villain who has not been given his due credit as a layered, complex villain: Admiral Marcus from Star Trek Into Darkness.

1.  Admiral Marcus Is A Genius

After awakening the superhuman Khan to harness his superior intellect in developing advanced weaponry and ships, Khan went rogue. The decision to awake Khan, made by Marcus, might be seen as highly idiotic by some, but in my humble fact, this was a genius decision. JJ &amp; Lindelof heavily implied that Marcus must have spent several, possible millions of sleepless nights wondering about the future of Starfleet, the observable universe and his place in it. Marcus knew that at least some aliens were bad and that he is awesome. It was because of this, Marcus realized that he was the only person fit to take the eventual throne of Emperor of the Universe. So, what does he do? Asks a cryogenically frozen man to build him a big ship. Bigger in fact, than Kirk‚Äôs already big, big ship. Marcus‚Äôs ship was very big. He knew that a ship should be big, because it is intimidating to the aliens that were infesting his future empire. I believe Lindelof was also implying that in the future, Marcus had plans to not only keep his big ship, but to make it bigger. These decisions by Marcus illustrate a true leader. 

Big.

2.  Tying Up Loose Ends

With Khan on the run, Marcus knew his days of being held in high regard at Starfleet were numbered. He knew he had to terminate Khan, but without a precise location, this was exceedingly difficult. But using his awesome imagination and his big ship, Marcus realized that torpedoes are weapons that are dangerous to most humanoid bodies. Marcus was able to uncover this information because he most likely read it in a book or asked the big ship‚Äôs computer. Marcus knew that he could talk to his ship‚Äôs computer, because during various walking trips getting lost in the ship, he noticed the computer had a voice that spoke in English. Marcus also knew that if he put the bodies of Khan‚Äôs crew in torpedoes that were fired from his big ship, or another big ship, these people would probably not survive the big explosion. With Kirk asking permission to kill Khan, Marcus seized the opportunity, knowing the torpedoes from his storage facility could fit on Kirk‚Äôs big ship if his assistant hired moving people to move them for him while he ate a hamburger in his quarters.

Marcus 1 ‚Äì Kirk/Universe/Spock/Everyone 0

3.  Calling Kirk ‚ÄúSon‚Äù - Admiral Marcus Is A Survived George Kirk?

It is not explicitly shown in the film, but I think it was JJ‚Äôs intention that Marcus was Kirk‚Äôs father George, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the 2009 film. George Kirk was seen flying head first into Nero‚Äôs big (but not that big) ship, but George was never shown dying. Because of this, I believe the only logical explanation is that George was secretly nursed back to health by Nero‚Äôs torture scorpions after suffering sustainable face injuries which temporarily made him look like a scorpion. Since Marcus was revealed to have a daughter, Carol, who is a similar age to Kirk in the events of ‚ÄúInto Darkness‚Äù, I think George‚Äôs (Marcus‚Äôs) first move upon escaping Nero‚Äôs ship and returning to Earth, was to have celebratory sexual intercourse with a non-scorpion, human woman ‚Äì Carol‚Äôs mother. I believe JJ was intending to reveal that Carol and Kirk were actually related ‚Äì which would explain why Kirk leered at Carol while she was undressing. He was noticing a striking resemblance in how she undressed the same way he undresses before having sexual intercourse with tailed alien twins and green women.

Why did Marcus not tell Kirk he was his father? Well, he did, multiple times during ‚ÄúInto Darkness‚Äù. He called Kirk ‚Äúson‚Äù at least eight times, which he thought would be enough for Kirk to deduct that this was his biological scorpion father speaking to him. When it was clear that Kirk was not getting the message, Marcus must have deemed Kirk an unworthy child, who should be fired upon by his big ship.

4.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not actually going to do this, are you?‚Äù

Faced with certain defeat on the bridge of USS BIG, Marcus knew that in situations like this, he should try and win, not lose. Win. Not lose, WIN. So, in order to avoid not winning, he says the following line to Kirk:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to actually do this, are you?‚Äù

Marcus was genuinely asking if Kirk was going to stop him on his path to ruling the galaxy. It was a logical question to ask, as Marcus was genuinely curious. Asking a question like this shows that Marcus is a human with above-average intelligence, unlike some movie villains, who possess below-average intelligence (See the shark from ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù or the monkey from ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù).

5.  Theory: Marcus Survived Khan Crushing His Skull

Khan was shown to be crushing Marcus‚Äôs skull, but we never actually see the outcome of this. It is my very logical theory that Marcus‚Äôs body was just a shell and the real Marcus was actually a space platypus that was puppeteering a fake human body from the inside. I have faith that I will see this Platypus iteration of Marcus in a future Trek film. I guess Kirk is also half-platypus?

1655409562,"This was on cable when I as randomly channel surfacing.  Although I‚Äôve watched it so many times over the decades since I was a child that I know it practically by heart, I was AGAIN struck by just how surprisingly good it is for a piece of 1960s network television.  ‚ÄùCity on the Edge‚Äù still wins the title for Best Episode of TOS, IMHO, but damned if this isn‚Äôt one of the best hours in all of Trek.  Some thoughts on why:

\-  It‚Äôs just a great concept and great story; an alien robot weapon from a long dead civilization in another galaxy that is maybe thousands or even millions of years old posing a seemingly unstoppable threat to our galaxy.  With the establishment of the dead Constellation (which in turn establishes that the Enterprise will likely fare no better) and a few minutes of dialogue about the machine‚Äôs planet killing capabilities, origin and course towards Rigel, the episode swiftly establishes one of the greatest existential threats Star Trek ever dealt with.  

\-  The script is almost flawless in terms of dialogue and pacing.  There are no pauses for comedic relief,  filler, yucks, or needless exposition.   

\- The directing and cutting is a masterclass.  The acting is spare, the blocking of the actors‚Äô movements is very tight and the scenes are well composed and cut to create tension and fast (but not frantic) action.  It never slows down but also never loses the plot.

\-  Star Fleet has never looked more military and professional in the bridge talk, technobabble and discussion of regulations. 

\- The specially composed music for the episode is brilliant, almost Wagnerian in dissonance and perfectly conveys the implaccable, unstoppable danger posed by the machine.  As a child the music alone frightened me. 

\-  William Windom‚Äôs acting as Decker is some of the best acting by a guest star.  He takes us on a journey with Decker from tragic figure in the wreckage of his ship (which was no doubt just as important to him as the 1701 is to Kirk) mourning his choices and dead crew, to an obsessed Ahab-like villain, to tragic figure again whose death we mourn(‚Äúa commander is responsible for the lives of his crew‚Ä¶and their deaths.  Well, I should have died with mine‚Äù).  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I know that?!‚Ä¶there was \[a third planet\], but not anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù   That line would have looked a bit ridiculous on the page‚Ä¶something you might laugh at, but Windom‚Äôs delivery makes it remarkably moving. 

\- Even the extras ‚Äì Scotty‚Äôs damage control team, the two security guards posted by the turbolift doors on the bridge‚Äì do more than the usual amount of acting by random people in Enterprise uniforms.  I particularly like Mr. Montgomery and the African-American guard.  Watch them closely in the battle scene when the machine is blowing the insides out of the Enterprise; the black guy looks to his left at Montgomery as if to say ‚Äúoh,shit‚Ä¶dude, we are fucked!‚Äù   Also, Mr. Montgomery gets props for being the one security guard in all of TOS who got a karate punch shot in and decked a higher paid and billed actor.  (He should still be ashamed of himself for being bested by a wheezing old Commodore, but I digress..).

\- That moment when Spock relieves Decker is one of the best in all of TOS.  ‚ÄùCommodore, I would not like to place you under arrest.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt DARE.‚Äù  Wordless beckoning to the two guards, who immediately step right up.  With that gesture, Decker knows the entire crew supports Spock and he needs to comply.  Vulcans never bluff, they just play hardball. 

\- Particularly with the remastered special effects, the space battles are THE best in TOS.  By a long way. 

\- Shatner could absolutely have chewed the carpet with some of the moments and lines he was given, but he didn‚Äôt.  His performance was generally understated, and there was some nice use of lighting to further convey his emotions.  When Decker goes on his suicide run, Kirk‚Äôs eyes had been specially lit when he was trying to convince his friend not to commit suicide; when Decker dies, Kirk drops his head so his entire face is in shadow.  Subtle and effective.

\-  ONLY thing that was a mild detour into 60s camp ‚Äî and mercifully happened only at the very end ‚Äî was Kirk‚Äôs joke that he found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù doomsday machine ‚Äúquite sufficient‚Äù with the jaunty flute music they used to lighten tension.  Ummmm‚Ä¶an entire starship crew is DEAD (horribly, no doubt, if you think about what it would be like to be on a planet chopped up into rubble from orbit), your friend just died in front of you, and an existential threat to the galaxy was just averted.   No time for jokes Jim! LOL

1655409197,"Star Trek seems to have a worrying habit of portraying fascism as brutal but effective. Just look at the Terran Empire and the Confederation as examples, both seem more advanced and more powerful than the Federation (I imagine thats because they just plundered what tech they wanted and didnt bother playing nice). Though I guess it could be argued that the Terran Empire overextended itself and that was the main reason for its ultimate downfall.

I got initiated to Star Trek by my mom and have been slowly catching up to all the series, movies etc. and I'm slowly (quickly) getting obsessed with it.

For this, I'd love to have a Trekkie (Trekker?) that has been following Star Trek for a long time and has witnessed the rise of the fandom/takes part in events or even organizes some! 

The interview would be conducted online and I'd need a screenshot as proof (so webcam on) :) The language is english so don't worry, you don't need to know german. The questions would be around the fandom, your history as a fan, your opinions on your fandom and others etc.

1655339522,"A new ship with new technology!

The OG Voyager being overall one of the earliest intrepid class starships and being brand spanking new when it was sent on its unintentional 7 year mission. The ship was full of new technology from the ships computer to its EMH, later ECH, warp 9 engine and variable positional nacelles. It also was a ship that encountered and utilized quite a bit of alien technology. Yet we never really get to see this tech implemented in more star fleet vessels. The Voyager-J being featured and name dropped multiple times throughout Discovery's 3rd and 4th seasons. 

The USS Protostar being a starship that is based on the silhouette of the USS Voyager. Even having a Captain Janeway hologram, and like it's muse. It also has an experimental engine. 

Captain Archer is the man who was instrumental in the formation of the federation. He was able to take the interests of many different alien species and help them align into one. Surely a Spacedock with his name would be capable of combining tech from many different Aliens into a single ship.

Picard S1 gave us the Artifact, an abandoned borg cube. We spent an entire season in and around it. Picard S2 gave us a hint of the result of this research: ""The Star Gazer"". A refit of an older starfleet vessel, but simultaneously the first of a new class of starship utilizing borg tech.

The 10c is a race with far more advanced tech than even the 32nd century federation. Based on previous evidence. I believe we are getting a new USS Discovery class or at the very least a brand new experimental USS Discovery. Based on the advancements we saw in Disco S4. I'm predicting better shielding, a new power source, a new style of transporter, a way to visit planets without EV suits, wormhole creation,  and new ways to communicate with species we've yet to encounter.",startrek,"What does the Voyager-J, the USS Protostar, the Archer Spacedock, The Artifact from Picard S1, the Star Gazer from Picard S2, 10c, and the USS Discovery have in common?"

1655302400,"There are some episodes in all the Star Trek series that are generally considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù but that also have plot holes, incongruities or things that just don‚Äôt make a lot of sense when you think about them. I was thinking this when TOS: ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Computer‚Äù came on cable the other day. I‚Äôve always liked that one a lot because it dealt with the issues of acceptable (and wise) use of AI, what being replaced by a machine can mean in terms of loss of humanity, and also because we get to see four of Enterprise‚Äôs sister ships and a nice space battle.

But when you think of it, the final battle that causes the loss of the Excalibur and many casualties on the Lexington, Hood and Potemkin doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. Everyone involved knew the Enterprise was under the control of the M5 AI. As soon as the Lexington was hit by full phasers in contravention of the rules of engagement, the four ships would have raised shields and presumably withdrawn to figure out what was going on. Wesley would never have put in a frantic call to Kirk saying ‚ÄúEnterprise, Jim, have you gone mad? Break off YOUR attack.‚Äù The most logical assumption in that situation would have been there was something wrong with the M5 ‚Äî why would Wesely ever assume it was the fault of the humans still on the Enterprise? Of course it was the machine malfunctioning and the logical thing for Wesley to do was order his ships to shield up and withdraw ‚Äî as the M5 allowed them to do after it killed the Excalibur ‚Äî and figure out what was going on. Sure, I can come up with head cannon reasons for what we see, but its not very convincing. Maybe Star Fleet‚Äôs order to destroy the Enterprise so precipitously was precisely because they had concluded the M5 was out of control and Kirk‚Äôs skeleton crew needed to be sacrificed‚Ä¶but why? They had broken off and there was plenty of time to figure out a non-lethal way to deal with the situation. Doesn‚Äôt completely ruin my enjoyment of the episode however.

1655254904,"The Maquis are a fascinating topic among Trekkies, given how many posts there are about them on this sub-reddit alone, as they present a number of questions and issues, though I do think they could have been executed better. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. This post is looking at their war with the Cardassians from a moral lens using the criteria of a just war.

Obviously war and violence are terrible as they diminish or extinguish quality and quantity of life, but alas they are sometimes inevitable due to circumstances beyond our control. So how do we reconcile the ideal with the practical? We do our best to fight ""just wars"" as in morally justifiable conflicts based on specific criteria, which I will explain and compare to the Maquis.

1. Just cause, as in there must be a good reason to go to war, like defend from an invasion, prevent an atrocity, or right a wrong.
   1. Here the Maquis check out in a way. They are being attacked and harassed by Cardassian settlers who want them out of the DMZ, and are willing to kill to do it. Obviously defending yourself is a just cause for violence, but this is just the first criteria.
2. Just authority, meaning the war must be declared and prosecuted by a legally recognized authority. Here the Maquis fail on two fronts.
   1. They are never recognized as a sovereign state, merely a paramilitary terrorist organization. Sure they traded with the Klingons but this is not the same thing as official recognition.
   2. They do not seem to have a consistent internal organization. What is their government? Are they a republic? A monarchy? Commonwealth? United States? As far as we can tell they are a collection of semi-autonomous military cells fighting a common enemy, with limited authority between them. This is important because it raises questions about negotiations and diplomacy. If Central Command WERE to try and end the war diplomatically, who would they talk to? Who would they negotiate with? Who among the Maquis has the authority to declare the war over? Chakotay? Eddington? Riker? Who? Given their whole theme is ""we didn't agree to this"" would ALL the Maquis get a vote on negotiations? Would the entire organization have to be negotiated with? Or would some accept a peace treaty and the rest keep on fighting? Without a central authority to negotiate and enforce diplomatic agreements what chance do the Maquis have of having a lasting peace?
3. Just intention, meaning the war must be fought with the goal of achieving justice, not personal glory, wealth, or aggrandizement.
   1. Here the Maquis also fail, or at least three of their leaders certainly do: Cal Hudson, Michael Eddington, and Thomas Riker. Cal Hudson makes it clear that his military actions are about revenge, not peace or justice (""I will not allow those deaths to go unpunished""). Michael Eddington is living out his fantasy of a heroic melodrama, which is how Sisko ends up capturing him. And Thomas Riker wants to distinguish himself from William Riker, the man he was copied from. Now does this apply to the rest of the Maquis? Hard to say, but given these men have nearly no resistance to their actions it seems that the Maquis are pretty cavalier about the whole matter, which may indicate that they share similar intentions.
4. Last resort, meaning all diplomatic options must be exhausted first. Here the Maquis fail again as they had multiple opportunities to end the conflict without violence.
   1. Sisko, with the aid of Dukat, uncovers evidence of Central Command smuggling weapons into the DMZ, which was leverage the Maquis could have used to entice/force the Cardassians into a peaceful settlement, but instead they continued attacking the Cardassians, escalating the conflict, exactly as Quark so eloquently explains to a VULCAN of all people.
   2. The Cardassians all but abandon the DMZ when the Klingons invaded. From most accounts the Maquis had virtual free reign in the area, leaving them the de facto rulers and giving them basically what they wanted: freedom from Cardassian rule. This was a PERFECT opportunity to offer a peace settlement: recognize us as independent and we'll stop attacking you so you can focus on the Klingons. But instead, the Maquis continue attacking and even make forays into Cardassian space itself, further escalating tensions and making the situation worse.
   3. The Cardassians did not forbid the colonists from LEAVING the DMZ. So is it REALLY a last resort if you can just leave? Obviously not. Sure, they had lived on that land for a while and had built homes and lives, but is a piece of land worth risking a full-scale interstellar war over? Should a few disgruntled farmers complaints derail weeks or months of negotiations and risk the lives of millions of people? Given the Federation was willing to resettle them, and compensate them for their trouble, isn't this just being selfish and obstinate? If you can escape a violent situation without injury or loss of property, is violence really necessary?
5. Reasonable chance of success; no point in sending good men to fight a futile conflict.
   1. Here the Maquis actually qualify. Central Command can't send in their full might lest they escalate the war into a full-scale war with the Federation, a war that cost them ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" and left their people ""weak and miserable"" as Picard put it. Thus, the Maquis are fighting a war against armed colonial militias, a force like themselves, not a professional, organized military that has them outnumbered and outgunned.
6. Only sufficient force must be used to achieve victory.
   1. Here the Maquis fail. When the Cardassians all but abandon the DMZ they escalated the conflict not just by continuing the war but actually using biological weapons on civilian targets. Michael Eddington had enough made to essentially exterminate the whole DMZ. So they not only squander a great opportunity but they essentially make it impossible for the war to end peacefully; if you're willing to use biological weapons on women and children where do you draw the line? What rules of war are you NOT going to violate? Wouldn't it be safer to utterly destroy you?

Thus, based on the criteria used, the Maquis were NOT fighting a just war. They were not being fearless freedom fighters, but rather they were selfish, obstinate people who risked millions of lives just because they didn't want to give up their land. Now would the Cardassians have honored their side of the bargain? Probably not, given their track record, but this is about the Maquis, not the Cardassians.

Sorry for the rant, and I have no idea if you guys agree or disagree. But I felt that I had to get this out.

It is just fundamentally gross. Fucker says ""I loved her. And when she died I stayed with her daughter. And then her daughter's daughter..."" ü§¢ü§Æ

The reason I struggled to finish watching the fucking episode is the jarring expectation that TNG wants you to think the ship doctor of the Federation's flagship (someone with the power to relieve Picard of command) essentially turns into a bumbling teenager on hormones who goes from beink ok to absolutely *addicted* to the ghostly sexual carresses and other gross touch of what at one point she learns is a himicidal malevolent ghost who was also her 100 year old's grandmother's 30 year old lover. Bleuch.. yea. Her 100 year old grandma wrote ""erotic"" journal entries about a 30 year old lover and not only does the Enterprise doctor finds thats OK to read, she ends up having nice sexy dreams coz of it and the ship counsellor *sanctions* this and even becomes *envious*. And the doctor gets raped by her grand mother ghost lover. Did i say that already? Is it sinking in? W.t.a.f? 

Until I watched this episode, I thought no episode will ever reach the level of gross idiocy, crass racism and stupid ineptitude that shat out ""Code of Honor"". There has never been in the history of ""decent"" TV an episode that so violently nauseated me. And yes, that racism is probably *the absolute worst*. But Sub Rosa is nastier in every other aspect. The rape culture, the sexism, the cringe, the whole throwback to that period when women were ""hysterical"" or absolutely out of control,  the ew-ness of it all. 

I really only wish this fucking episode came much earlier than the final season as that would've definitely put me off from ever continuing to watch this official. At least Code of Honor came much earlier, which gave the show chances to redeem itself.

To clarify: this isn't intended to be another dunk on *Discovery.* It's more-so me expressing frustration and disappointment that after four years, much of the cast of *Disco* still doesn't feel familiar and friendly or familial to us. Outside of Tilly, Saru, Culber, and (like her or hate her) Burnham, the rest of the cast is just people. Mini-arcs that last a couple episodes like Detmer's PTSD are hollow and waste potential. Potentially big areas of conflict like Stametz's disdain for Burnham's willingness to sacrifice his family for the greater good of the Federation are simply never acknowledged again. Owo is from a society on Earth that rejects modern technology and space? That's fascinating! *Tell us more.* Why did she leave? How was that received by her family? Did it cause irreparable damage? Detmer has a best friend she sends a goodbye letter two in season 2. Who is it? Why is she so important? Is she also in Starfleet?

Owo and Detmer are very clearly friends - show us more of their friendship on and off the clock! Rhys' village was wiped out by a hurricane. Ok...how did that affect him? Is that why he joined Starfleet? 

Those are all stories that are completely lost in *Disco's* insistence on season-long arcs. We're left with so many questions.

Now contrast that to *SNW*. We feel more familiar with Pike after 6 episodes this season than any other captain. We're getting great backstory fill-in on Uhura. La'An's trauma was hinted at in episode 1 and returned to for its own story in episode 4. We've already learned the origins of Una.

Le Guin's story is a philosophical piece that has no action as such.  It simply describes a situation, a scenario, with a rather disturbing moral conundrum for the reader to contemplate.  So, obviously, SNW took that scenario and added a plot line, and got Enterprise mixed up in it too.  In the short story we never knew where ""The Ones Who Walk Away"" went to.  In SNW we know they formed their own breakaway colony and are now trying to actively subvert the system.  There was never a hint of anything like that from Le Guin, but it's right in line with what I expect from Star Trek.

The sad story of Yvette Picard is stretched out like too little buttle over too much bread for nine whole episodes, all of it detailing Yvette's struggle with mental illness and (surprise) eventual suicide. I have several criticisms of the matter.

To begin with, Yvette's mental illness is never specified. It's vaguely referred to as (paraphrasing here) ""A great darkness,"" ""Episodes,"" etc. She demonstrates symptoms of various mental disorders, but by and large she suffers from typical Generic Hollywood Mental Illness.

Rather than doing some actual research on a real-life mental illness that affects people, rather than accurately identifying that illness in the show and portraying its symptoms and how people cope and what it does to a family, rather than showing ways of dealing with it, instead, *Picard* goes the route of the Generic Hollywood Mental Illness. Rather than showing how you can support people struggling with mental illness, rather than showing what a mental disorder does to a person, its origins, its treatment, *Picard* goes the lazy route and deals with it all ambiguously purely to give Picard a tragic backstory.

I feel that this method of portraying mental illness is reductionist and harmful, and am saddened that it continues to be propagated by Hollywood in this day and age.

Now, if this story took place in the 19th century, I could excuse it, but Picard's flashbacks take place in the 25th century. Canonically, mental illness, at least in *TOS*, is eliminated, as per ""Whom Gods Destroy,"" wherein only 15 people remain in the galaxy who are incurably mentally ill. Now, Star Trek has always played fast and loose with established canon, which I do not mind.

However, Star Trek has, by and large, in my opinion, portrayed mental illness fairly modernly. True, ""Whom Gods Destroy"" is a tad simplistic, but need I remind you that *Next Generation* in its era was revolutionary for having a psychiatrist as part of the main crew. This, combined with ST's overall optimistic view of the future, is salt in the wound. 

Rather than getting Yvette in an institution with professional help, rather than medicating her and keeping an eye on her at all times, Maurice gives her rampant freedom and then locks her in a cell without keeping Jean-Luc in the loop. I realize humans are flawed, but Maurice's actions, frankly, in my opinion, don't fit in with ST's vision of a bright future.

What purpose does Yvette's melodrama (and retconned suicide, might I add) serve, beyond dampening the spirits of the season even more? As near as I can see, she's a textbook case of romanticized poorly-researched mental illness, stuffed in the fridge to give our hero an unnecessarily tragic backstory. And I honestly don't think that's in keeping with the Star Trek tradition.

TL;DR: Mental illness complex, Yvette Picard's characterization dumb, do better ST.

1654992380,"New Trek fan here.

Before Covid, I had never seen a Star Trek show. Now, I have now watched them all back to back (thanks, Paramount). Every episode of every season, except the animated one. For the most part, they were excellent and I get the appeal. I‚Äôm glad I did it. Here‚Äôs my uninformed layman ranking:

1. Next Generation. This one had the best captain. Great crew, I liked Geordi and Data quite a lot. Not a big fan of Wesley Crusher or Bev.
2. (Tie). Strange New Worlds. This is the best show in the series if it keeps on its pace. Some top shelf sci fi.
3. Voyager. Best cast overall. In some ways, this was a better show than TNG. Well written. Every character was likable, especially the doctor and 7 of 9. Didn‚Äôt care for Tom Paris. Janeway was a top 3 captain.
4. Enterprise. Why was this one so short? The temporal war was kind of corny (full of paradox and holes) but I liked Archer, Skip, Tupal, and the Flox. It was a good show. Could have lasted longer
5. DS9. Pretty distant 4th place for me, because I didn‚Äôt fall in love with the characters despite this being so many seasons. They never grew on me like Voyager‚Äôs did. Dax was especially cringe. Quark is the exception, I did enjoy him. Of all the shows on this list though, this one and TOS had the best sci fi writing. The dominion plot line was excellent. Good story arc.
6. The Original Series. This was a good show, it just showed its age a bit too much for my personal taste. Like DS9, the stories were excellent. The characters, though, never quite grew on me, despite being household names (Kirk, Spock, Scotty) which surprised me
7. Picard. It might have been higher on the list but I don‚Äôt think it was trying to be a trek show. Picard‚Äôs character is nothing like TNG, and seven‚Äôs nothing like Voyager. In a vacuum, this would be a good show but considering it‚Äôs supposed to be a sequel, it wasn‚Äôt faithful to its predecessors and that distracted me

7 Discovery. Personal preference only, but this show never did it for me. It never hooked me quite like the others. Doesn‚Äôt make it a bad show, but the others had stronger characters and plotlines I believe. And better Klingons.

Finally, I watched another non-trek show called Battlestar Gallactica and if you haven‚Äôt seen it, do. It was excellent. Possibly #1 on this list, if it were trek.",startrek,Ranking the Trek Shows

1654957534,"Without wishing to spoil too much, the ending of the recent ep made me think about episodes of previous trek where the outcome was, let's say, less than positive.  A few that came to mind...

The Offspring - Lal's death, obviously

The Survivors - the ending whilst not particularly negative, was very much unresolved.  Just leaving the alien, alone on his planet with his imaginery wife.  Picard says that the Fed had no laws which could scale to what he had done, something about his solitude being the most fitting punishment.

The High Ground - as soon as Picard and Beverly are rescued, the Enterprise leaves, no conclusion to the problems, no follow up captain's log.  Just gone.

I enjoyed this SNW episode, as I have all so far, also enjoy those TNG episodes listed above.  I guess it shows that the good guys, or even 'not bad guys' in some cases don't always have to win for a story to be effective.

Anyone else have examples of this accross the star trek world?",startrek,SNW Ep6 - Very TNG like ending

So while watching it dawned on me that the way the characters (writers) described what was going on with the events in ""the town of Tombstone, AZ on Oct 26, 1881"" was exactly how someone who had never encountered a holodeck would describe the experience of being trapped in one in someone else's story program.

I have a whole new appreciation for this episode and the writer (Gene L. Coon writing as Lee Cronin) who conceptualized this story at a time when a holodeck was an utterly unknown concept.

1654823642,"Spoilers for this week‚Äôs episode ahead.  

TLDR:   Brave enough to lose.  

So there is this moment when watching The Dark Knight when you realize that the Joker will do bad things that are normally prevented by the hero in a movie.  And in that moment you also realize to your excitement, shock, and horror that the film makers are not going to hold him back to fit into the traditional hero story.  For me that moment is when he blows up Rachel.  You realize from that moment on that anything can happen in this movie and nothing is predictable.  

The end of Empire is a bit the same.  The rebels pretty much lose in that movie.  Han is frozen and taken.  Luke gets some bad news.  I‚Äôm certain there are other examples.  New Caprica in BSG.  Marco‚Äôs big plan in the Expanse.  The best fiction doesn‚Äôt just harp on close calls and heroic wins.  It is at its best when you see the heroes struggle and sometimes fail.  When they show they are vulnerable and human.  It‚Äôs not something you see a lot of in episodic TV however.  

This week in SNW the good guys lose.  Full stop.  Pike allows himself to be manipulated (quite obviously) and while his crew races for answers he is distracted. The end result is a kid pays the price.  And what a great bit of acting from Anson Mount shows us after.  He is pissed off.  At the woman who betrayed him.  At her whole planet.  And mostly I think, at himself.  

In my past life I represented abused kids as a lawyer.  A ‚Äòguardian ad litem‚Äô.   It was gratifying to see the calculation that Pike made to immediately prioritize saving the boy over everything else.  Sacrificing his own well-being in the future first and foremost.  He gives up the proffered opportunity to take the easy way out of his hard future because it it the right thing to do.  I know personally that sometimes you can‚Äôt help everyone you try to.  It‚Äôs very difficult to live with.  Years later I still deeply regret a lot of cases I wasn‚Äôt able to win and what may have happened to those kids because of my failure.  

The fact that SNW is willing to go there is kind of awesome.  It reminds me of Sisko living with it.  This show is hitting way above what I thought it‚Äôs weight class was.  If it continues on with this level of excellence it could be one of the best science fiction shows ever.

I ask this to kind of see if the show will always end up with Pike facing his fate in the Menagerie or, if the show will find a plot arc that saves Pike from that fate while saving the crewmen he does. The only way I could see that is if Pike‚Äôs horrific fate is never referenced again beyond TOS. I feel like they could craft a story to just address the menagerie and yet, still spare Pike.

My point of being bothered by the plot completely came with the DMA: a galaxy threatening threat AGAIN, that OnLy The CReW of ThE diScOvErY can save (hell, that ship has technology from so many hundreds of years, refitting it equals it only to the then-modern ships, how could it became the best ship they had!?), and so on.

But man, going off beyond our galaxy was SO GOOD!
It started for me with the preparations. For the first time I really felt that the galaxy depends on the crew of the Discovery. I felt the fear and tension of the crew and the ambassadors, I believed it, other than before where it was clear (to me) that they will not dye the next time the stupid Alien with a strange connection to Dilithium sneezes.

Don't get me wrong, things like Booker and his new friend doing their own thing and taking a hostage was, once again, boring. But hear me out, when they crossed the galactic border it felt so much like old Star Trek. And then the strange planet where I was thrilled what the creators of the DMA are and what they do and why and and and ...
And then the Aliens showed up and THEY FELT LIKE REAL STAR TREK ALIENS. I couldn't believe my eyes, they remembered me of the crystaline creature or the care taker. Star Trek has always been about slapping some prosthetics and/or color on people and the unnamed species #0815 is created. But they got abstract creatures as well and that was what I really missed.

I'm not talking about anything major (like erasing an episode or even an entire series, as much as you might want to). Just some nitpicky thing that's always bugged you that you would fix if you could.

A few examples off the top of my head:

* Make warp speeds and travel times consistent. Changing the warp scale between generations is fine as long as it is maintained.
* Make Starfleet as diverse as the Federation's membership. There may be reasons why there are a lot of humans in Starfleet, but other races should be better represented in the shows.
* Diverse Starfleet, part 2: Starship names should also be more diverse. We've seen, what, a handful of Vulcan ship names, an Andorian or two, one Ferengi, and a whooooole lot of Earth names.
* Stardates...don't...make...sense. They will now!
* Non-human appearances should be more consistent. To use the elephant in the room as an example. Whether Klingons look like those from TOS, the movie/TNG era, the JJverse, or NuTrek is a matter of fan preference, but stick with one unless there is a story reason otherwise.

Strange New Worlds (Optional), Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok (Suggested), Amok Time (Suggested), The Naked Time, The Cage, Strange New Worlds (Suggested)

## Intro

A little while ago I made a post about the [Star Trek Machete Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/elut9p/a_new_way_to_introduce_newcomers_to_star_trek_the/). You can go read it if you want, but I'll reexplain everything here so you don't have to.

Let me start off by saying that Ghosts of Illyria and Spock Amok are now two of my most favorite Star Trek episodes ever, definitely in the top 10. It may be a little early to declare something like that, but I feel there is something special about those two episodes that I will explain below. Before I get to that though, here is a quick re-primer on the Machete Order. 

## The Star Wars Machete Order 

The tl;dr for Machete Order is that it was invented as a way to introduce new fans to Star Wars after the prequel trilogy was released. The problem is that there were two ways to watch Star Wars, Chronological Order (1,2,3,4,5,6) and Release Order (4,5,6,1,2,3). Both methods had issues that are explained in my original post, but the tl;dr is that Chronological Order spoils the big twist in Empire Strikes Back early and Release Order has a dark ending. So there was a fan who created Machete Order (4,5,1,2,3,6) which solves both problems in one go and is, in my opinion, a very good way to introduce people to Star Wars.

## The Star Trek Machete Order Problem

Now there has been a LOT of opinion on how to introduce someone to Star Trek. Everyone has their own method that they feel strongly about and if you want to read some of the suggestions, go ahead and browse the comment section of my original post. But ultimately, the problem boils down to this: Star Trek requires an extra step.

The main issue is that unlike Star Wars, Star Trek often has very rocky starts. TOS season 1, while good, is not as good as season 2. TNG season 1 is widely considered to be the worst season 1 in all of Star Trek. Yet, TNG as a whole is easily the most popular Star Trek series ever. Even my original introduction order came with problems. I wanted to start at the most accessible Star Trek movie, The Voyage Home, but The Voyage Home has MAJOR spoilers for the whole series. Even one of the suggested variants of starting at The Wrath of Khan has issues; although I admit, I think this is a better solution than the one I came up with. But it all boils down to one central problem: Star Wars can always start with A New Hope; Star Trek cannot *easily* start with The Cage, or The Voyage Home, or Wrath of Khan or even Encounter At Farpoint. No matter where you try to start, there will always be some sort of problem you have to deal with.

## The New Star Trek Machete Order

Strange New Worlds (Optional), Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok (Suggested), Amok Time (Suggested), The Naked Time, The Cage, Strange New Worlds (Suggested)

Ghosts of Illeria is easily one of my favorite episodes of all time now. Not because it was a really good episode, which it was; but because at its core, it is the SAME episode as The Naked Time. The away team brings back a virus that nearly destroys the Enterprise. It is a premise so universal that nearly every Star Trek series has an episode like it: The Naked Time, The Naked Now, Babel, Macrocosm, Strange New World/Observer Effect. What's really great is that most of these episodes come early in the series before the characters are really established. The premise is THAT good. 

After Ghosts of Illeria comes Spock Amok, an excellent throwback to Amok Time. We get to see Spock interacting directly with T'Pring (technically a canon violation, but I personally think they made the right decision on that one). We also see Spock dealing with his own inner turmoil over his half-vulcan/half-human heritage, a big theme present in Amok Time as well. But Spock Amok does something else really great: it sets up the Spock/Chapel relationship; a subplot most prominient in the two TOS episodes The Naked Time and Amok Time. 

So when you take these four episodes together, Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok, Amok Time, and The Naked Time, you end up with the perfect connection point for introducing someone to the very start of all of Star Trek: Spock Amok/Amok Time. After that, you work your way backwards. Since you just saw the new version of the classic Star Trek contagion episode, Ghosts of Illeria, how about seeing the very first one, The Naked Time. And then how about seeing where it all began with Captain Pike, Number One and the Enterprise: The Cage. If you're pressed for time, you can even skip Spock Amok and Amok time and go straight to Ghosts of Illeria/The Naked Time.

## Where To Go From Here?

You may have noticed that Strange New Worlds is in two places, one is optional and one is suggested. This is because I think that Strange New Worlds should come AFTER The Cage, not before. The obvious question to ask after taking someone through these episodes is ""what do you watch next?"" my suggestion?

Whatever you want.

Seriously, whatever you want. Do you like TNG better? Go watch TNG. Does the person prefer the Original Series to the new one? Go watch the Original Series. Or maybe they liked the more modern feel of Strange New Worlds. In that case, go watch Strange New Worlds (the episode) after The Cage. That's the true beauty of the New Star Trek Machete Order, in six episodes you have given someone a taste of the best of what Star Trek has to offer; and as a bonus we were able to go back to the very beginning to do it. 

So that is why Ghosts of Illeria and Spock Amok are in my top ten favorite episodes, they serve as the perfect connection point for introducing all of Star Trek. 

Lastly, I'll conclude by saying that I'm glad Strange New Worlds is taking the direction that it is; one hand in the old, one hand in the new. In my opinion, it is the perfect time to introduce someone new to Star Trek because now we can all enjoy Star Trek from the very start once again, old fans and new fans alike.

Later in Starbase 1's conference room scenes, there is a table with two Constitution class ship models on it (one on a slightly higher pedestal than the other).

Any theories on what this other ship could be? We know from TOS that there were at least 12 of them. The show seems to want to introduce the concept of another ship that looks just like the Enterprise. But to what end?

Remember in one of the trailers to the show, there is a scene of a wrecked Constitution class ship on a planet.

1654538043,"This post is inspired by an earlier one also dealing with the Q/El-Aurian war. 


In Picard S2 Guinan refuses to call the Q Gods. She instead uses the word Denizen. A word I'd never heard of before, so I googled it. It seems to be more of a legal distinction than one developed for normal day to day conversation, so excuse me if my definition isn't 1,000% accurate, but it is accurate enough for the point I need to make.. From what I can tell Denizens are people who aren't required to necessarily be citizens of a place, but are there so often that they are granted certain rights by a place.This would imply that the Q aren't born of the continuum. They just live there. They're granted powers from the continuum to protect it.

If we think about what Quinn said about the Q in Voyager. They're not God's nor are they Omnipotent. 

....""As the Q have evolved, we've sacrificed many things along the way, not just manners but mortality and a sense of purpose and a desire for change and a capacity to grow""....


What if the Q are able to bond to the continuum and receive their powers, but in doing so it rips them away from their life before they were a Q. No memories of a time before being a Q would lead someone to believe that they were always a Q. Freeing them from the Attachments of their specific universe, time-line, dimensions etc. Yet, the Q eventually forgot why they were entrusted with their powers. 

We know that El-Aurians are able to interact with the universe through sound and frequency. The listeners who are also able to know when time has been altered and are able to feel with something is different with people. What if the El-Aurians are able to take these abilities and sever the Q's connection to the continuum for short amounts of time. Stripping them of their powers and immortality.

I for one don't particularly hate them, but at the same time I simply do not enjoy them as much as TNG, which continues to give me great pleasure even during the 17th or so rewatch.

Now there are already a lot of good ideas and arguments out there on why this happens. I tend to agree with a lot of what has already been said, and I openly admit to a certain nostalgia when it comes to the role that Next Generation plays in my own life. But watching the recent second season of Picard I couldn't help but wonder what else there could be about it. And that's when this quote of Gene Roddenberry struck me:

&gt;The starship Enterprise is not a collection of motion picture sets or a model used in visual effects. It is a very real vehicle; one designed for storytelling  
&gt;  
&gt;(Introduction of *Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual* by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda)

This summarizes quite nicely what I believe to be a central aspect of Classic Trek: First, there was a story to be told. Which problem should be approached? Which relationship should be explored? What is the lesson that audiences can take away from this tale? A bit later on, there were even conflicts to be carried out and resolved. The story was then made accessible through the familiar crew of the Enterprise acting it out, and it was made exciting and fascinating by virtue of space exploration and future technology.

But phasers and bat'leths were never about phasers and bat'leths per se, they were about giving depth and credibility to an overarching vision of a peaceful and enlightened society who get in touch with other species to discuss (and sometimes fight about) their views and explore other viewpoints. It was like finding fitting characters for a pre-determined story. In the end, every single crew was but a set of puppets that the puppetmasters used to tell stories they could have just as well told by themselves; only that it was much more fun having a captain and first officer and ensign live through their adventure as conduit for some higher morale or interesting food for thought.

With New Trek, this entire notion has now been overthrown. The puppets were turned into the puppetmasters themselves, who try to play and interact with their in-universe surroundings to dig up more stories and adventures that only occasionally contain valuable lessons or insights. Nowadays, the characters are there first and the seasons are about coming up with stories that these characters might fit in. There are only a few key moments left which I genuinely enjoy and sometimes even admire, not because of their effect on the story or next week's plot twist, but for the value of the very real, emotional content.

For example, there's a scene where Picard talks to Ren√©e in the second season of PIC. For what it's worth in terms of story continuity, I dislike this scene because I find it hardly credible that he could talk her into carrying on and moving forward after never ever having met her before. From that perspective, it feels like lazy writing to quickly wrap up the episode within 45 minutes and continue with whatever comes up next week. But if you know Jean-Luc Picard and if you know the role he has played during seven years of TNG, constantly standing up for his ideals and moral integrity while also being vulnerable as a person, you suddenly begin to realise how much truth lies in his words not for Ren√©e or the series, but for the human condition and our daily lives right here and right now.

By the same token, there are a lot of small moments in the newer series that, when I watch them by themselves without thinking about any character arcs or canon lore, still deeply move me and sometimes can even teach me a lesson. But in the end, it's nothing compared to my all-time favorite TNG which as a whole continues to spend me comfort and warmth. Instead of laying the focus on a story that can be stretched out over several episodes, it lays the focus on valuable insights and lessons and wraps them into a story that is rather short and easier to grasp. For even in the darkest circumstances, it acts as a light -- sometimes only a glimmer -- to find the way forward.",startrek,My take on why 'Modern Trek' is different

Isnt that the real problem with genetic engineering?  Khan was a villain, with or without the juice. From Space Seed:  

KIRK: He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring.

SPOCK: ...Because the scientists overlooked one fact: superior ability breeds superior ambition.

I'm wondering if superior ambition was really part of the package or was that just the trait of the individuals selected for the augment trials?   Its likely the scientists looked for people with certain traits, like ambition, to further amplify the results of the engineering.

In DS9,  Doctor Bashir, I Presume:

O'BRIEN: You're not a fraud. I don't care what enhancements your parents may have had done. Genetic recoding can't give you ambition, or a personality, or compassion or any of the things that make a person truly human.

Later in that same episode:

BENNETT:For every Julian Bashir that can be created there's a Khan Singh waiting in the wings ‚Äî a superhuman whose ambition and thirst for power have been enhanced along with his intellect.¬†

So Bashir didnt get heightened ambition in his augment package?  Or is he just the Steve Rogers to Khan's Red Skull?

The Federation has seemed to write it off as a solid fact that a side effect of augmenting is ambition.  But do they know that for certain?  After all, the Federation does use genetic engineering to correct birth defects and that doesnt seem to cause a race of ambitious babies bent on galactic dominion.

It seems likely the Eugenics Wars were so devastating that the Federation still uses this genetic engineering is bad fear mongering to keep it on the shelf.",startrek,Genetic Ambition?

But by Season 2 the Cerritos is the one performing the daring rescue of a nominally ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ship. In fact the very captain they are saving is a fan service cameo from TNG (although not of the hight of Riker and Troi). And most of the episode is showing the hard work put into making the last minute rescue possible. The danger faced by the crew as they implement their technobabble solutions.

1654287610,"*Strange New Worlds* is the first *Star Trek* entry I've genuinely enjoyed since the final season of *Enterprise*.  Unfortunately, the series will always be held back by its completely unnecessary Prequel conceit.

None of the characters on this show bear any resemblance to the characters from the 1965 pilot.  They have the same names... and that's pretty much all they have in common.  The new versions are interesting in their own right, but they should've just been conceived as completely new characters.  It would at least liberate them from being forced into a predetermined fate of prequel characters.  


We already know how the Spock, T'Pring, and Chapel love triangle will turn out.  Any intrigue from that love triangle is gone.  We already know what is in store for Captain Christopher Pike and  Lt. James Kirk.  Even the state of the universe holds no surprises.  There's not much they can do with Klingons and Romulans because everything is nailed down by canon.

All these limitations are completely unnecessary.  I don't think people are watching this show because they wanted to see more of Captain Pike from 1965's *The Cage*.  They're watching because 2022 series is good, not because they liked the 1965 episode.  There was no good reason for this show to have been a prequel. 

The show should've just been about Captain Anson Mount of the NCC-1701F Enterprise, a direct sequel to TNG.  That would've opened the door for TONS of appearances from the Star Trek alumni from the TNG, DS9 and VOY era.  All of those actors are perfectly age-appropriate for a post-TNG series.

1654252475,"TLDR:   Who doesn‚Äôt like hijinks?

The early 2000s saw a fairly severe turn in the tone of science fiction and fantasy.  SG1 was ending, Nolan released Batman Begins, Enterprise went all in on the Xindi ‚Äò9/11‚Äô story, BSG was rebooted by Ron Moore. Before anyone reaches for their pitchforks or lights a torch I loved every one of these shows or movies.  My purpose is not to be critical but to observe that that tonally things had transitioned to a trend of being dark and gritty.  Gone were the days of Christopher Reeve or Jack O‚ÄôNeill.  

Two decades later we still have the Snider cuts, smoke monsters, and don‚Äôt even get me started on what happened on my other favorite sci fi franchise this week.  I never thought I would have to seriously censure what my three year old watches on Disney in a franchise that claims to be made for children.  

Someone on the Trek Reddit recently compared SNW to Ted Lasso and I want to give them credit.   My skills to find a source reference in Reddit are weak but whoever it was had a good point.  I think another good comparison is the tone (although not quite as goofy) of the Orville.  Yes- I am aware the Orville is heavily uh influenced by the TNG and TOS (and if that is a deal breaker for you see: DS9 and B5).  I am not being critical or comparing franchises.  

SNW in a nutshell isn‚Äôt a drag.  It‚Äôs not depressing.  Even the Gorn episode has moments of charm and levity that kept it from drowning into a self important epic mess.  Streaming SNW is like watching an episode of Cheers or MASH.  Excellent writing and performances without the heartburn.  You know there is a decent chance watching it will make you happy.  

In these times when just glancing at the news can make you sad or horrified I think entertainment like this is vital.  It is absolutely a favorite part of my week.  I hope we get six seasons and a movie.",startrek,SNW is part of a much needed tonal shift.

1654190236,"Critics were supposedly given the first six episodes of Strange New Worlds ahead of the premiere. Most gave rave reviews (deservedly so), but those who didn't said it was because the second half of the episodes, particularly the last two, were incredibly awful and everything that people hate about NuTrek.

I've watched every episode of SNW. Last week's episode was the best IMO, but is one of the ""bad ones"" according to these critics. Meanwhile, today's was spectacular, classically light-hearted Trek episode. I certainly can't think of anything NuTrek that was like it, let alone the parts of NuTrek people complain about.

A big part of me is hoping these were indeed the episodes the critics were given, because if this week was an indication of ""incredibly awful,"" I'm super stoked for the second half of the season!",startrek,Were the six SNW pre-screening episodes given to critics the first six or just random ones?

My favorite parts, however, intrigue me and confuse me a bit at the same time. 

First things first, our girl Chapel is officially a bisexual hoe (good for her)! What I loved the most was Chapel and Spock's dynamic and chemistry. The way Christine validated Spock's Vulkanness and Humanity was so endearing and Spock getting irritated at and punching that dude who insulted Chapel was fun to watch as well. So, there is definitely a special friendship and understanding being formed between the two. 

And yet, I wouldn't say they are a case of relationship I would be satisfied to see remain purely platonic, because it isn't from Chapel's perspective, she definitely has a crush on Spock already and we know she is going to have this yearning for him throughout, like, the decades. 

Chapel looks at Spock kind of longingly throughout the episode and don't get me wrong, I love sad romance, but I wonder how it is going to work out considering how the things ended between Spock and T'pring (who is also an interesting character) in the episode? Though, I think it becomes clear why Spock and T'pring broke up eventually, neither could give the other what they truly needed.

So if they were assigned by the leaders of the Federation, how can all the species in the Delta quadrant refer to it as the Delta quadrant? I mean even the Borg refer to it as such. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and so on are terms from here on Earth. Hell even the Omega Particle is referred to by species residing in the Delta Quadrant. They even reference time like we do.

I feel like discovery‚Äôs connection moments are kinda lazy? I didn‚Äôt notice it until season 3, but every scene plays out the same way and it just feels lazy, and kinda forced. Characters look at each other in this weird way, and take like 20 seconds in between sentences. It‚Äôs not unbearable, but it happens in almost every episode, and I‚Äôm honestly kinda sick of it. 

Yes I understand that they have all been though a traumatic experience jumping 900 years into the future find the federation in shambles, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where these connection moments seem like lazy excuses to push the plot forward. 

I feel like part of the problem also has to do with not only the way that way that discoveries plot is laid out (similar to Picard with larger stories in one season instead of smaller ones per episode), but also the way that the characters are written.

Seeing how the crew preferred to escape and get away from them, shows how terrifying these creatures are. 

This episode showed me that Star Trek can be very dark too...

Much to my surprise - they did neither!

Confirmation when Picard is rebuking Yar, you get a clear shot of the consoles behind Picard and the left console clearly only has one D-Pad, meaning it's the Ops graphic.

1654121649,"I've come up with the first character for a fanfic story based around the crew of the USS Sojourner, a half-Cardassian woman by the name of Iarot Taggert who serves as a lieutenant commander in engineering.  


Her mother is a Cardassian woman by the name of Tieko Khaddal who married a Starfleet engineer from Sydney named Malcom Taggert who was helping restore infrastructure destroyed by the Dominion. Iarot was born and raised in Australia, the climate of which her mother very quickly became comfortable with and she even avoided some of the health problems Cardassian women face while pregnant. Tieko worked at the consulate for the new Cardassian state in the city, as the the one in San Fransisco was not fully built yet. Her father worked at the Utopia Fleet Yards.  


Although Iarot didn't have a tightly controlled childhood, she still underwent the mental training Cardassian children usually undergo, something that her father Malcolm was in full support of. Iarot's paternal grandmother Deborah Taggert was a malignant narcissist who frequently mentally and emotionally abused her children. The experience made her father see the training as something that could make her much more resilient in the face of someone trying to manipulate her. 

This idea was proven to be accurate during Iarot's only meeting with her paternal grandmother which ended when Deborah told Malcolm to 'get your forked tongue freak of a daughter' out of her sight. This also helped her greatly with her studies at Starfleet Academy as well as an occasion where a Ferengi was trying to gaslight her into thinking she was misremembering overhearing him talk to his superior about some gems he'd stolen.  


The other trait Iarot displayed that was typical of Cardassian children was showing up at her parent's workplaces unexpectedly to see what they did. Malcolm would later go on to say that the closest he ever came to a heart attack was opening a Jeffries tube to see her staring back at him. While he would recognize that this behavior meant she loved him, he was insist she stay out of more sensitive areas. Teiko also made it clear to her that while heated bickering would be considered courtship behavior on Cardassia it wouldn't be seen as such by other cultures. Malcolm elaborated on this by  telling her that he got into an argument with Teiko during a walk in the park when they first began dating. Teiko got flustered by how quickly Malcolm became argumentative and asked him if it was usual for humans to be so lewd in public.  


Iarot decided to pursue an engineering career after hearing about the rebuilding efforts on Cardassia Prime and her father's role in them. The challenges Starfleet's engineers faced and their methods of overcoming them captured her imagination from a young age, to say nothing of the fact that Starfleet would go so far to rebuild the home-world of a species they were just at war with. She does not have anything approaching disdain for her Cardassian heritage, although her mother had no reservations telling her about the Union's crimes against the Bajorans and other groups. She has a fairly warm relationship with her family on Cardassia Prime even if she has difficulty relating to them at times.  


In terms of personality, Iarot is fairly open and maintains a decently sized social circle largely made up of her fellow Sojourner crewmates as well as cadets she befriended at the academy. She also has both her mother's sarcasm and her father's love of practical jokes which she often applies to her engineering skills to. On one occasion when a particularly disliked Starfleet commodore came aboard and began irritating the crew, she got into contact with former academy classmates who had the misfortune of dealing with him, figured out his food preferences, and reprogrammed his replicator to only give him what he absolutely hated. When he moved quarters, she moved the 'hack' to the replicator in his new room.

Episode 1 of SNW felt like showing me light bulb, discovering what could become my new favorite piece of content for years to come. It felt like a movie, but a really good one, i felt like a child again discovering something new and amazing in front of my eyes.

I've been a fan lf Star Wars my entire life cause i love the sci fi and rarity of new worlds and journey on the galaxy.. The ships, unique technology and futuristic aspect of it. The rarity of seeing new species and knowing that there's a whole galaxy to explore alongside new characters and discover everything around it.. 

But Star Trek felt different, it felt like it was something i was looking for a long long time, a normal tv show/movie, about a crew that have for mission the discovery and exploration of new planets and stars, and everything in it. The personalities and characteristics of that crew and the technology surrounding them. The plot and base storytelling is not confusing or heavy (meaning i can watch it without paying that much attention like i do with star wars or The Expanse), i can just relax and enjoy it without thinking that much, that's why i love episodic tv shows so much and i can see that Star Trek have a lot of those.

The message this first episode had, is better than any other message that any other tv show have shown me in recent years, it even made me think and that could even change people's mind on how to prevent violence and instead have a mentality of unity despite the differences. 

I already love the crew, the girl with white hair, the nurse/doctor (don't remember her name haha) is already my favorite character of the crew. I like the other ones too, but that one caught my attention. She reminds me of Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter.. 

I don't know if Star Trek (the older series and early content) is like that or better, but im confident that i will be all month and what is left of the year, watching Star Trek content (movies, tv shows, animation, etc)

I know that most of you probably have Star Trek : The Next Generation on DVD. I recently purchased the 2020 release because my fiancee is very into it now, after watching it on BBC America.

1653855531," In-universe,  the reason is that warp drive is too slow‚Äîyou would need Sleeper ships or some alternative (non-organic crew?) to travel to another galaxy. But the writers could have made warp  drive as fast as they wanted, so we have to step out of the fictional  universe to really answer the question.

The  current arrangement, where travel to the other side of the galaxy takes  a lifetime and intergalactic travel is vastly beyond Starfleet‚Äôs  capabilities, is actually very helpful to *Star Trek*‚Äôs writers because it gives them a lot of options for where a story can be placed:

* Close  to the Federation‚Äôs core worlds, where resupply is easy and things are  usually pretty safe, but there are a lot of friendly people who might be  threatened by a villain.
* At the edge of the Federation, where there‚Äôs more danger to the ship and help is weeks away.
* In unexplored space, where they could encounter almost anything and really need to be self-reliant.
* Several years from home, like in *Q Who?*, where the journey home is daunting but still plausible.
* A lifetime from home, like in *Voyager*, where they‚Äôre completely isolated and really just running on hope.
* A  truly hopeless distance from home, such as another galaxy, where they  are totally screwed unless they can succeed in the next 44 minutes of  television.
* The Spore drive cannot operate outside the milky way
* The Burn still being a problem in the 32nd
* Hits the warp 10 factor transforms humans in space lizards
* Only the USS Protostar have a ""proto drive"" by default... (in 2383!)
* GREAT BARRIER (Maybe or not builded by the Q's)

If *Star Trek*  had routine intergalactic travel, these distance scales would be much  harder to pull off. Travel within a galaxy would be almost  instantaneous, so that scale is pretty much useless. You‚Äôd increase the  absurdity of ‚Äútransbeaming down to the star system‚Äù (er, which of the thousands of  cities do you mean, sir?) by talking about ‚Äúarriving in the M33 galaxy‚Äù  or whatever. And what if you *truly*  wanted something to come from an unimaginable distance? ‚ÄúFrom the  Andromeda galaxy‚Äù is way easier for people to understand than ‚Äúfrom the Laniakea to the observable universe!!.

Or ad least piloting unmanned probes to the dwarf galaxies.

The  single-galaxy scale also means that, when a ship is traveling between  places, it can encounter a lot of stuff along the way. The interstellar  space of *Star Trek* is already implausibly dense with interesting stars, anomalies, and ships, but audiences don‚Äôt quite realize that. Everyone *knows*,  though, that intergalactic space consists of vast stretches of complete  void; many more viewers would realize how unrealistic it was that the *Enterprise* would stumble across a disabled freighter or negative space wedgie on the way to a peace conference in Andromeda.

So, from the writer‚Äôs perspective (out-universe), confining the action in *Star Trek*  to the Milky Way is a big advantage. It provides a simpler, yet richer,  environment for storytelling, with many more useful plot options.

Long live and prosper, People of the Earth.",startrek,Why is there no intergalactic travel in Star Trek?

So let's just do one ""example"" scenario: Pike decides to lead a dangerous away mission because he knows he personally cannot die on that mission. But that doesn't mean he can't be injured or captured. So if he is injured or captured, now they have to send another team to try to rescue him, and some of those people are killed. OR, while he is down on the planet something bad happens up on the ship because a less experienced person was in command.

Basically, any change he makes in his ""normal"" decision making process due to his future knowledge can still have extremely bad/deadly effects for other people. And the only way he can try to avoid that is to try to make the same decisions he would normally make if his own life were at risk.

It's actually a very complicated situation to be in, and something a lot of people seem to misunderstand.",startrek,Why Pike knowing his fate does not ruin the suspense or mean everything he does will turn out well

I couldn‚Äôt find anyone else talking about this, but the Illyrians in episode 3 seemed to me like an analogy for queer people. (I could also definitely see it being interpreted as about race, but that‚Äôs just how it read to me).

For example, the eugenics war (at least in this case) could be symbolic of the aids crisis. 

Or this whole series of lines when La‚Äôan and Una are discussing Una being an Illyrian:

Una: And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.

La‚Äôan: If that‚Äôs what you believe [that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it], why do you hide it? Why hide it from *me*?

Una: I‚Äôve been hiding it from a lot of people. All I ever wanted, since I first saw the stars, was to join Starfleet.

Now imagine for a second that they‚Äôre not talking about her being Illyrian, but about her being queer. Those lines still fit, don‚Äôt they?

Or, even more blatantly, after she tells Pike about her being Illyrian, she asks in her personal log:

‚ÄúWhat if I hadn‚Äôt saved all those lives? Would the captain feel the same? What would he do if I wasn‚Äôt a hero? One of the ‚Äògood ones‚Äô? When will it be enough to just‚Ä¶be an Illyrian?‚Äù

This line I feel has ties to both queerness and race. However, I‚Äôm going to stick to addressing the queer ties.

It is phrased in a very specific way. Often, queer people are referred to as ‚Äúone of the good ones‚Äù when they aren‚Äôt overt about their queerness ‚Äî when they seek to blend into straight society.

Or, better described by a word coined by Yuvraj Joshi: Respectable queerness.

Star Trek has a history of incorporating queer allegories into the epsiodes. For a more in depth view of the history of queerness within Star Trek I recommend this article: https://www.startrek.com/news/your-guide-to-queer-identity-and-metaphor-in-star-trek?amp

I was born in 1973. That means that on September 28, 1987 I was 14 and just about to start high school. As it happens. 9/28/87 was also the date of the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. I had already been ‚Äúindoctrinated‚Äù to Star Trek from the original series being in syndication for some years and the idea that the concept could be taken further was a bit of a dream come true. This new adventure of space and possibility was something to really take my mind in a natural direction and it took my heart with it. I met LaForge, Data, Worf, Crusher, Troy and of course Riker and Picard‚Ä¶ which is why I‚Äôm writing this now. These people/characters (right or wrong) hold a place in my heart that cannot be denied or deleted. So when I sit down to watch Picard 34 years later, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù, it‚Äôs like seeing friends I have not seen in so many years.

1653512752,"I was re-watching The Maquis episodes and the line ""It's easy to be a saint in paradise"" reminded me of how DS9 found ways to go to darker than TOS/TNG without ignoring the roots established by its predecessors.

To me, the key seems to be that DS9 serves as an evaluation and test of the morality established in those earlier series. The idea that on the frontier things are rougher, that not everyone plays by the Federation's rules, and eventually the necessity to adapt to the ugliness of war. However, what kept that within the Star Trek universe is the counterbalance. Sisko remarking about the challenges of the frontier, O'Brien lamenting about how ""evolved"" humans can still commit terrible acts when pushed to the brink of starvation and subject to dehumanization, Quark remarking about the darker side of humanity, Bashir arguing to Admiral Ross about how getting in bed with Section 31 abandons the Federation while Ross takes the side that the ends justify the means. Section 31 as a whole only works because it pits cynicism against the more idealistic Bashir and allows us to examine arguments pertaining to war that the show might not have otherwise been able to.

Deep Space 9 didn't simply ignore the past or what was established in previous series. Instead it explored and challenged it. To me that's what makes it work. When Star Trek goes dark without counterbalancing it with examination - or to put it another way, to go dark for fun rather than because it serves a greater message/narrative -  then it just feels lazy. This isn't meant as an attack on newer Star Trek, but more an observation on what made DS9 often work so well in my opinion.

Star Trek is in its roots optimistic and while it can absolutely deviate from that optimism effectively, the burden is on the writer to justify that decision and examine it within the work. Otherwise what makes Star Trek unique among sci-fi is diminished.",startrek,Why DS9's darker tone worked while still feeling true to Star Trek

Some have theorized that the timeline was simply shifted in order to make it relevant since 1992-1996 happened 30-26 years ago (which in fairness, the showrunners of PIC straight up admitted was something they heavily debated until deciding to go with their Project Khan Easter Egg instead). However, neither is true. Enterprise introduced the second Eugenics War.

More specifically, there has always been more than one Eugenics War, and then Enterprise clarified (or retconned, depending how you look at it) that ""more than one"" means ""exactly two."" We all just didn't notice because we Mandela Effected ourselves into thinking ""Eugenics Wars"" meant ""augments are fighting"" instead of, you know, being about eugenics. Let me explain:

In ""Space Seed,"" Spock's dialogue includes ""The mid-1990s was the era of your last so-called world war."" While the WWIII part and the later line of the episode being 200 years after 1996 were certainly retconned, what's important is that McCoy immediately follows that up by replying, and I quote, ""The Eugenics Wars."" Plural. The events of 1992-1996 was one eugenics war. McCoy tells us there were multiple.

Later in ""The Savage War,"" we learn that Colonel Green led a genocidal war in the early 21st century. Enterprise (in ""Demons"" and ""Terra Prime"") elaborated on Colonel Green's genocidal war as involving he and his armies personally murdering hundreds of thousands of people with radiation sickness and other ""impurities"" in order to make sure that they couldn't pass down such traits to subsequent generations.

Guys. THAT'S A EUGENICS WAR. Colonel Green was leading a war centered on selective breeding. A literal eugenics war. It just didn't involve augments this time.

From there, SNW tells us that a Eugenics War followed on the heels of the Second Civil War before spiraling into WWIII. Cool tidbit, but it's not a removal of the 1990s war involving Khan nor is it a transition of its timeline. It's just that the second Eugenics War's time period of ""early 21st century"" is now clarified as being ""around 2026"" (or more specifically, right before WWIII).

Recent Trek social media infographics have also confirmed there have been two as well. ""Genetic Modification: -The Cause of Both Eugenics Wars. - Not just for tomatoes!"" and other tidbits. Fun stuff, as well as gives us confirmation that the augment war of the 2020s wasn't just a timeline shift of the one from the 1990s.",startrek,"Friendly reminder that the Second Eugenics War was introduced in Enterprise, not Strange New Worlds."

My problem with this, though, is that at the end of Picard Guinan points out a picture of Rios and that she knew him. If Rios stayed behind in 2024, that should have been in the Confederacy Timeline.

Official ""first contact"" with the Borg was by the Enterprise-D in 2365 from the 2nd season episode ""Q, Who?""  But then we find out that 7 of 9's parents set out on their own in 2355 to track down rumors of the Borg, and lo and behold, they find a cube somewhere I'm guessing in the Beta Quadrant in or near Romulan space.

But wait - the Borg had to have been known of by the Federation in at least 2293 when the Enterprise-B rescued the survivors of the El-Aurian homeworld's destruction.  Someone from those ships had to have debriefed Starfleet on who destroyed their world...?

And let's take it back even further to 2153 with the events of the Season 2 episode of Enterprise ""Regeneration"" where the NX-01 is partially assimilated by left over Borg tech from the sphere the Enterprise-E blew up over Earth in 2063.  So...Starfleet had to have known of the Borg in 2153, and quite possibly some human discovered them before then from 2063-2153...

Lastly: the Vulcans.  We know official First Contact was 2063 with Earth, but the Enterprise episode ""Carbon Creek"" establishes the Vulcans were on Earth as far back as 1957, though that appears to have been accidental as their ship crashed.  And now, from the episode in Picard Season 2 we see that there were at least two other Vulcans (that looked like they crash landed) on Earth in the late 1980s or early 1990s and influenced the life of future FBI Agent Martin Wells.  Maybe these Vulcans that influenced Wells crashed like T'Pol's ancestor in 1957, or were they doing some sort of duck-blind study of humanity like we see Starfleet doing in TNG's Season 3 ""Who Watches the Watchers"" and Star Trek: Insurrection?

Thoughts?  Do you know of more first contacts like this?",startrek,First Contacts that Weren't
1653496670,"So I watched ""Errand of Mercy"" and ""A Private Little War"" last night.  I had seen the former but not the latter.  Kor is so much more subtle and insidious than later Klingons.  And the fact that the Klingons look to be playing ""the long game"" in ""A Private Little War"" by arming one faction of a less-developed race over another by arming them with flintlock rifles.

So what happened to the Klingons after TOS?  We don't see much in TMP other than them trying to fight V'Ger, but in Star Trek III Kruge is a bit more brutish than Kor and Kang (I'll try to re-watch Day of the Dove tonight).  The Klingons in ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" were a bit brutish but even Captain Koloth was more reserved than later Klingons.

My theory was they needed to ""thug up"" the Klingons to make them truly evil and easier to root against.

But maybe my own theory is off because General Chang in the Undiscovered Country is pretty ruthless and shrewd...and Chancellor Gorkon seemed to march to a different (Klingon) drummer.  Worf also was pretty reserved, but that is because of the influence that humans had on him I think.",startrek,TOS Klingons Were Much More Conniving
1653492239,"Since the end of Season 2 of Picard, there‚Äôs been a lot of legitimate concern about the handling of established events in canon and the apparent change of the timeline of events. Some of this is a problem created by the new shows constantly going back between established events. It will naturally cause some problems no matter how well they handle it. 

I had a thought that I wanted to propose: maybe it‚Äôs time to start viewing Star Trek with comic book rules. What I mean by that is in comics, what matters is that certain characters and events exist, but it doesn‚Äôt matter when they happened. They can put Batman in the 1970s or the 2020s, and his parents were still killed, he still has Robin, hems still fighting Joker, Riddler, Two-Face in Gotham, but none of it is tied to a specific timeline unless it‚Äôs specific to the story. What they maintain is the characters, the setting, the thematic elements, and care little for any canonic timeline. 

So maybe we know First Contact is an established event but don‚Äôt know (or care) when it happens, because we know it was after the Eugenics Wars, the NX-01 is 100 years after that, NCC-1701 is 100 years after that, NCC-1701-D is 100 years after that, etc. We keep the relationships between events, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be tied to a specific origin date that ends up creating problems.

1653436704,"A few years ago I decided that I wanted to break into Star Trek. I believe this was about 3-4 years ago to be ‚Äúexact.‚Äù If you asked me at the time whether I was a Star Wars guy or a Star Trek guy I would‚Äôve absolutely answered Star Wars. I‚Äôm not the type of person who believes you have to ally with one camp; it just happens to be a popular question! Regardless, Disney has demolished my interest in the main Star Wars film series with the recent sequel additions (though I will always love the original trilogy). That on top of Disney siphoning every last drop of material they could from their purchased franchise had burned me out on all things Star Wars, but that‚Äôs besides the point. I was curious about Star Trek.

Part of what drove my decision to start down this insanely long path was the fact that I already had a bit of a relationship with Star Trek (as I imagine most if not all Americans do). I enjoyed the movies with Chris Pine (controversial I know), but more importantly I had memories of TNG from my childhood (born in 1990). My Grandpa was a huge Star Trek fan and was always watching TNG as it came out. I was too young at the time to really absorb the material, but the memories are still there creating an inevitable association between Star Trek and my Grandpa.

So I did a bit of research to get a better understanding of all of the Star Trek material and what direction I should go. The ‚ÄúWhere Should I Start‚Äù post on this sub was actually a HUGE help in this regard. There was more Trek out there than I expected, but in the end the starting point was an easy decision‚Ä¶The Next Generation. Just about every list I found ranked TNG as the best series, and it was specifically called out as a good starting point for people who are new to Trek and who might find TOS too cheesy. 

Going into this I knew that Star Trek (at least the old school stuff) could be quite cheesy with cheap sets and special effects layered with mediocre acting and absurd fight choreography. Knowing this from the start probably helped me stay on course as long as I have since I knew what to expect. On top of that I have a couple of coworkers who are hardcore Trekkies, and taught me on what to expect and look forward to! One key piece of information for me was that TNG (and most Star Trek shows) had a rough start for the first couple of seasons. Knowing that it gets a lot better helped me work through the weaker earlier episodes, even though I still enjoyed them for the most part. At first it was hard to take the acting seriously, but as TNG went on it got a lot better. It seems that as the show progressed the actors honed in on their characters and their chemistry with their co-stars. I‚Äôm sure there are numerous other factors potentially including my own lens of the show, but either way the improvement was palpable. I was hooked. 

Now the way that I have been watching Star Trek is a bit unique. It has become part of my work lunch ritual. I get an hour lunch every day I work from the office, and I use that to hide away and de-stress. This includes a comforting meal alongside Star Trek on my phone. It is my getaway and makes each work day so much more enjoyable. Outside of work I don‚Äôt have a lot of solo TV time, so work lunches have consisted of 95% of my Star Trek viewings. This is the reason that I‚Äôm only 2 series in after a few years. On the bright side it means I will be watching new episodes (to me) for years to come!

At this point I have finished the entire TNG series, and I just finished DS9 last week. Both were so good by the end! I was unsure on my next step, but ultimately landed on The Original Series. I am only a few episodes in, and I am shocked at how much I am loving it. I knew it was famously cheesy and low budget, but there is something about it that I just enjoy. It's almost like a bunch of 1960‚Äôs men time traveled to the future, were handed control of a spaceship, and sent out to do their thing. Unintentionally hilarious at times, and yet still enthralling. I‚Äôm psyched to work through the episodes and then the movies! 

I guess what I am getting at, and why I felt like breaking my usual lurker status, is that watching Star Trek for the first time has felt like some kind of culturally educational experience. I feel like I am gaining something by watching it. A connection to something that has existed for decades and has captivated fans all over the world for just as long. And seeing how active and supportive (other times confrontational of course) the Star Trek community can be has been an extra source of joy for me. While I was still working my way through TNG my Grandpa passed away, so this has also been a way for me to remember him. I never got to tell him about this Star Trek journey I am on, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because we always shared a love for Sci-Fi and the shared connection exists regardless. I feel that connection in this community as well.

1653432763,"  TOS:

Definitely the Balance of Terror that finally, concretely, establishes the Romulans.

Assignment: Earth: We are introduced to the Supervisors and Gary Seven, which we later see is connected to the Renee Picard/Europa Mission, the death of Q, the connection with Wesley Crusher and the Travelers, the rise of Adam Soong and his Project Khan and even the creation of Data, the origins of why the Klingons have smooth foreheads in TOS, and the ""new Borg"" that want to join the Federation.

Space Seed - anything with Khan - his story line inspired three movies and countless episodes throughout the rest of Trek (all the way to Picard and now SNW).

Mirror, Mirror: Mirror Universe has been a MAJOR part of DS9 and Discovery, and was a pretty good two-episode arc in Enterprise.

TOS Movies:

The Undiscovered Country - laid the groundwork for the Klingons to become our allies in the TNG era.

TNG:

Encounter and Farpoint - Establishes Q - a major character/force throughout TNG, Voyager, Picard, he even introduces us to the Borg.

Where No One Has Gone Before: Establishes the Travelers and their eventual involvement in Wesley Crusher's life, and the link with the Supervisors who help usher Earth through dangerous times (Gary Seven, Tallinn/Laris).

Elementary, Dear Data: Establishes Moriarty, a self-aware hologram the presages the Doctor from Voyager and his struggle with securing rights for other self-aware holograms.

Q, Who? - Borg introduction

Measure of a Man: Establishes Data as not the property of Starfleet - leads to repercussions lasting until the time of Picard with the treatment of the Synths and the ban on artificial lifeforms in the Federation.

The Emissary: This is where we first meet K'Ehleyr and she and Worf hook up that ultimately produces Alexander.  Bear with me - but without K'Ehleyr the events in ""Sins of the Father"" from Season 3 don't happen.  So, this episode lays the groundwork for Worf and Picard's involvement in the succession of Gowron to be Chancellor of the Klingon Empire, the Civil War, the destruction of the Enterprise-D by the Duras Sisters over Veridian III, the death of Captain Kirk on that planet, and Gowron pulling the Empire out of the Khitomer Accords and starting a short war with the Federation, and ultimately to Gowron's death by Worf in DS9's seventh season.

Yesterday's Enterprise: SO MUCH happens here - destruction of Enterprise-C, rise of Enterprise-D, Picard names as Captain, treaty with the Klingon Empire secured, the eventual birth of Sela who is integral in Spock's reunification efforts of the Romulan and Vulcan people.

The Offspring: Data produces his child - sets up more implications twenty years later with the Synth attack on Mars, banning of artificial lifeforms, etc.

Best of Both Worlds: Obvious - Picard is assimilated, the Borg almost take Earth/the Federation, Riley Frazier from the USS Roosevelt is assimilated and later becomes part of a disconnected Collective on a planet in the Delta Quadrant and saves Chakotay's life.  Jennifer Sisko is killed in the Battle of Wolf 359 which later helps Benjamin come to grips with the Prophets in the Bajoran Wormhole.  Lays the groundwork for the development of the USS Defiant and Defiant Class, lays the groundwork for the events of First Contact.

1653430192,"I am profoundly disappointed with Discovery and Picard and here's why. There's a very simple structure to al TOS, TNG, DS9, Voy and ENT episodes; a very clear beginning, middle and end. Characters have established arcs and their actions follow their established traits in a consistent and logical way. I don't even have to provide examples, because if you've ever watched one of these shows, many should immediately come to mind.

Within this framework, morality tales are told that endeavour to show multiple sides of the issue being explored. Based on cultural values which are either established through canon or explained in the beginning of the episode, we have an immediate understanding of their position and why they behave the way they do. It's analagous to chess; we all know how the pawn, the knight, the rook and the queen move and it's up to the writer to position them in interesting ways. 

Modern Star Trek rejects this template in favor of something I do not comprehend. The ingredients are there, but the meal is badly prepared. Everything is very loosely connected (if at all) and the emphasis is on how characters *feel individually* as opposed to how they *behave cooperatively.* I find the legacy of Star Trek to be an ill fit for this type of storytelling -- round peg, square hole.

If you genuinely prefer Picard or Discovery over older Star Trek, I'd be very interested to hear which elements of the new shows appeal to you. I don't understand how these shows find their audience and would like to learn. What am I missing?",startrek,Old versus new.

In 2020 , with online classes and being a lazy 8th grader I binged TNG and Voyager and came to the conclusion. Uhura , Deanna and Seven of Nine are like the characters that have to have some sex appeal , even T'Pock. like in the case of Seven and Deanna they have a specific tight fitting uniform , not that there's anything wrong with that its more like yo this is different and im sure this indicates a special thing of emphasising their attractiveness as a a character trait. maybe it was to make the show more interesting to casual viewers who could focus on pretty people when the ethical dilemmas became too 'bland' although the philosophical stuff is my personal fave heh. anyways its not fair to say they were Bond Girls at all , they were defined as attractive but had their own characters , depth and place as their own person but i feel like they were also supposed to be defined as 'sexier' which is really interesting, so only in that dimension of character they strike me as . Uhura i feel like had to be clothed like that or portrayed , because of the era, the fact that as disturbing as it is may be bigoted people would be more lenient with seeing a POC if she was more sexualised and also cos female characters kind of had to be defined as very pretty to the primarily male audience to be certified as a valid protagonist. Still its interesting  to see and Im glad it eased over time .

Creating a test that is inherently impossible doesn't show someone's capability of dealing with a ""no-win scenario"". 
It's a simulation. No one even cares about winning anymore.
It's almost a rite of passage because at the end of the day, most people will take it and just follow their lifes and learn nothing from it, because if the result is the same for everyone, it will not show anything.

Kobayashi Maru was really more of an analysis on how people deal with a test and Kirk was actually the only one that noticed how it's predictability wasn't that big of a deal.

Definitely arrogant ngl, but simply accepting a problem will not make it go away and even though hacking was kinda dumb, it shows how he would not just panic or sit and do nothing.
He would try to save everyone to the end, and the Kobayashi Maru test doesn't value this, hence the hacking

If u think about it the Kobayashi maru in AOS was just an extrapolated version of Kirks thinking in The Corbomite Manouver.

Too exaggerated? Yes. Was he wrong? Yes.
But at the same time it is illogical to believe that a simulation that everyone knows its impossible could actually be a real mirror to anyone's ability in a real life situation.

But more and more of my friends were into it. Many times over and over my friends recently have been talking about Star Trek. Citing Next Generation and Deep Space Nine as masterpieces. I figured why not see for myself? And started it. We've been watching it together as we hang out. And I have grown to love Picard. Riker. Data. LaForge. And all the rest of them. And last night as we were watching an episode after I finished DMing DnD still hanging out. A feeling of sadness entered me. 

I brought down the mood a bit. I didn't mean to. I was enjoying the episode so much I just couldn't help but think. ""I just wish my dad was here so I could talk about this to him."" And it struck me just for the first time ever I had thought that. I've never before thought that. I never had anything to relate to him. And I sort of said this and my friends just sort of uncomfortably nodded and I moved on. But I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about having the experience to actually be able to bond with my dad over something. Get to sit down with him and just talk about this. I feel ridiculous for tearing up now typing it. But I feel robbed. I feel robbed of getting to experience this and tell my dad we are alike in some way. Tell him my thoughts. My favorite characters and episodes. But I'll never know his. And to be honest that makes me angry. I want to be able to go to him and talk to him about a new favorite episode and see him nod and remember it. Or talk about a certain character and something they did. I wanna know his thoughts and how he would have reacted to me watching it. How he'd smile or get excited. But I just won't. 

I needed to put this out there. I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I made my friends uncomfortable and talking about it to my mom is just sure to make her sad on the topic. And just thinking it isn't helping. I needed to get this out as words on screen or on paper. I'm sorry if this isn't the type of content allowed on this subreddit. I just don't know where else to go.

1653256822,"Long time Star Trek fan here, especially someone who loved TNG (since season 2) and DS9. I kinda liked some NuTrek stuff,  for example the first (new) Star Trek movie from 2009 and Lower Decks season 2, but Discovery and Picard, that is something else.

My  critique is not new tho and was mentioned several times on reddit:  The crew of Discovery is not working together at all, emotions are all over the  place, philosophy doesn't matter, many crew members are underdeveloped,  Tilly is not convincing in her role, did I say that emotions are all over the place? Burnham is a  genius scientist and at the same time an awesome tactician, and behaves  like a counselor. Plus, it seems that everything revolves around her. She will solve every problem, alone. 

I  watched Discovery because there were some good ideas and characters in  season 1 and 2: Lorka, Pike, Phillipa and Saru were awesome. But  overall, the main storylines in season 1 and 2 were rather  disappointing. The reveal of the burn in season 3 was the worst I have  seen in sci-fi since a very long time. 

Now season 4: This was a story for maximum of 3 or 4 episodes  (or one long movie) stretched to 13 episodes. I had  hoped that without Tilly, and Burnham now as a Captain, that this could  be a bit better, but damn was season 4 underwhelming. Maybe even one of the worst Star Trek seasons.

For Picard, it's partly the same. The interaction between the main characters is not really convincing, like there is no chemistry at all. Season 1, while the writing was unbalanced, at least had some redeeming qualities. The conspiracy and overall darker elements were interesting, but the last two episodes and some episodes between two and five didn't resonate with me.

Now season 2: It started so great, the first 2 episodes were awesome and the first half of episode 3 was great, but then we had six 'filler' episodes. I know, not directly filler, but it was extremely hard to watch. The ninth episode was the worst (plot holes, plot holes, plot holes).

Long  story short: My main issue is the writing, the characters and their interaction. All these flaws are even more visible in the latest season of Picard and Discovery. The user score on metacritic and rottentomatoes is lower than 3.0 / 30%.

Can someone explain to me what went wrong? Why is it so bad? Or do you all think it's actually good, and I am just overly critical?",startrek,"What went wrong? (Picard season 2, Discovery season 4)"

*I posted this last year, but there's been several seasons of shows released since, some stuff has now been proven true/false, and I updated + added a few based on other users ideas that have been written since*

I've heard some great ones over the years, curious what other fans have come up with / heard over the years.

**The Vulcans are descended from augments**

Despite being banned in the Federation, genetic engineering appears to be common place in the Galaxy. Numerous races have tinkered with their own genomes, the Borg and the Dominion actively alter DNA for example. The Federation has banned it ostensibly because of the Eugenics wars, but why is it that the other Federation members have gone along with it? Because most of them had similar experiences.

I'd go so far as the say that surviving the development of Genetic Engineering is one of the pre-warp barriers for a civilization.

1500 years ago the Vulcans experimented with genetic engineering during their early days of space flight. This is the reason the Vulcans have such impressive physical abilities and why they are telepathic. The Romulans, Remans, and the other offshoot species are similarly results of genetic modification. The various problems and conflicts they had in this era where their version of the Eugenics wars.

The Vulcans then banned genetic engineering like the Humans did, which is why they readily accepted/encouraged the ban when joining the Federation.

But unlike humans their Augments weren't all exiled or killed off. The proto-Vulcan race of that era is technically extinct. Today's Vulcans and Romulans are the descendants of interbreeding of original proto-vulcans and the original augments. So they aren't Augments specifically but inherited a number of their traits.

The Aenar may be the result of ancient genetic engineering, and the Denobulans tweaked their genomes as well.

With the Andorians, Vulcans, and humans all having had bad experiences with Genetic engineering it's no wonder the Federation banned it.

**Dr Crusher chose the post on Enterprise to be closer to Picard for Wesley's sake**

Wesley was starting to get himself into trouble on Earth and didn't show a lot of motivation in life until a brief encounter with Jean Luc Picard. Picard showed up at their house while visiting Earth because he wanted to catch up with Beverly. Wesley was super intimidated by him because of the stories he had heard about Picard and his Father and embarrassed himself. Rather than laugh Picard said one of his typical 1 liners to Wesley that ended up giving him a ton of self confidence. That brief encounter had a profound impact on the boy.

Dr Crusher saw what a positive role model Picard was on her son and arranged to be transferred to Enterprise in the hopes that Picard would take Wesley under his wing. Which is why she keeps sneaking him onto the bridge in the early episodes.

**Starfleet has cloaking technology, just not the military kind**

The illegal Pegasus cloak aside, the Federation does have cloaking technology. But it's low grade stuff that they use in duck blinds and the like, not for military vessels.

The Treaty of Algeron only banned military use of Cloaks.

**The Excelsior's Transwarp wasn't a failure, but it didn't meet its lofty expectations either**

The Transwarp drive of the Excelsior is the reason the warp scale got rejiggered between TOS and TNG. It worked and became the new standard for the fleet. The Enterprise D has that version of Transwarp but now they just call it regular Warp Drive instead.

**The Borg Farm civilizations**

The reason the Borg don't just show up in force to Earth is because it isn't to their advantage.

The arrival of a single Cube forces that civilization to make a massive push in cultural and technological development. Just look what the Federation was able to develop in a decade after the Borg showed up.

Eventually the Borg will either show up in such overwhelming force that the Federation doesn't stand a chance, or the Federations technological development will slow down or plateau long enough that a single cube will be enough to assimilate Earth. Then it's game over.

**Garak used the Biomimetic Gel to make the bomb**

There was no buyer for the Biomemetic Gel in In the Pale Moonlight. Garak had the optholithic data rod already and just needed the gel to make the bomb. In typical Garak fashion he'd never tell Sisko what he was actually planning. Bashir even mentions that the Gel can be used to make organic explosives, that arguably can't be traced. Meaning he could have made the Bomb to appear to be just be a sandwich or a plant...

**Earth uses the Vulcan economic system**

One of the reasons Earth was able to recover so quickly after First Contact is because the Vulcans taught humans their system of post-scarcity socialist economics. A system they had spent 1000 years working the bugs out of.

**Replicators are the 24th centuries version of a microwave**

Everyone who eats from a replicator knows the quality of the food is reasonable but doesn't compare to real food. It's like the 24th centuries version of fast food or a vending machine, it takes no effort, it's cheap (free), and they are convenient/ubiquitous. The food in general is also healthier than a modern burger joint.

They are common on Starships because it's an efficient method of feeding a crew on a ship in the middle of nowhere, but on Earth and the colonies people usually eat 'real' food.

**Starfleet has a great pension plan**

Picard's line ""The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity."" can be interpreted as meaning that those that work to better society get compensated for it.

If you don't work society will give you a basic income (like some form of UBI) but you only get the bare minimum needed to survive. While those that work get compensated with better houses, more transporter credits, better entertainment, priority access to medical care, and better food, etc.

This is partly the reason there are so many willing colonists. Earth despite being a paradise is boring and there are only so many jobs. While volunteering to be a colonist is an option for even the uneducated the get their own nice home, land, and benefits that only the well employed and educated usually get. They have to work hard to get it, but to many it's a challenge and a chance at a better (more interesting) life.

Starfleet is a stressful and well educated job, so the ships are designed with the above philosophy of compensation in mind. That's why the ships all have creature comforts like holodecks the Officers seem to be able to use whenever they want. Good food, relatively lavish quarters, and the Officers seem to be able to get lavish goods and a stipend of Gold Pressed Latinum whenever the are off world to buy stuff. These are all perks of the job.

For lack of a better term, Starfleet also has a great pension plan. This is why Starfleet officers seem to get nice retirement homes on Colonies or on Earth. It's a retire perk.

**France is a tourist attraction**

To quote Futurama: ""Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language. Hello! Bonjour! Crazy gibberish""

The theory goes that most of Western Europe was bombed into a Radioactive wasteland during the 3rd World War resulting in much of the worlds population loss. During the early days of space flight European settlers made up most of the early colonization efforts because they wanted to escape the burned out wreck that was Europe. Hence why the Lunar colonies are New Berlin and Tycho City (Denmark), why there's a bunch of Irish + Scottish colonies, etc

The Vulcans helped Earth undo the radioactive damage making much of Europe habitable again (having survived their own Nuclear holocaust 1000 years earlier). But by this point the various countries were depopulated so they invited in tons of foreigners.

The catch was they would give you citizenship and free land with permanent ownership in exchange for you adopting a stereotypically French, German, Italian, etc lifestyle, etc in order to revitalize the local culture.

~~The Picards descend from a family that took this deal, which is why they have a vineyard and consider themselves French even though it seems they have an English background. They probably learned French in school even English had become the defacto universal language of Earth by this time.

There's another working theory that Jean Luc and Robert went to an English Boarding School in Yorkshire where they picked up the accent.~~

Picard Season 2 has made this bit defunct.

**Nick Lorcano was really Tom Paris**

Robert Duncan McNeil and the Producers have confirmed that Lorcano was the inspiration for Tom Paris. An Admirals son that screws up in the Academy and gets kicked out. But they came up with a new character because they felt Nick was irredeemable.

In headcannon Lorcano was Tom Paris' Mother's maiden name. He used the assumed name in the Academy to distance himself from his Father so that he wouldn't be constantly compared to him and have less pressure. Even though most of the Admirals and Teachers knew exactly who he was.

**The Federations war strategy is a combination of tactics used by NATO and Israel**

In the event of a Hot War the Federation sends in Starfleet to hold the line until it's very large pool of reserves can be activated (which is very much like Israel) while the member worlds militaries are called up for wider service (like NATO).

Older Starfleet ships are pulled out of mothballs in fleetyards and can be re-activated and armed with more modern equipment in a matter of weeks. While fleetyards ramp up production to produce newer ships at a much higher rate, but this can take 6 months to a year to make a real difference.

Ships that normally have compliments of 20-50% Starfleet graduates are reduced to only 10%-20%, junior officers are given field promotions providing experienced command crews for a larger fleet, while large numbers of active reserves (retired officers, officers from member worlds own fleets, and large numbers of trained crewman who having taken Starfleet courses to become reservists) are activated to crew the vessels.

Member world fleets like the Vulcans and Andorians send officers to crew Starfleet ships while taking on a wider defensive role within the core Federation territory. This frees up Starfleet to fight on the front.

Starfleet also has a large Marine Corps (Ostensibly referred to as Starfleet Security, and of which O'Brien was originally a member) for ground wars which is backed up by reserves consisting of the indpendant militaries of the various member worlds like Andorian Commandos, Vulcan security, and possibly Earth MACOs (which may have just been the basis for Starfleet Security). These units have their own independent command structures that agree to work under an appointed Starfleet Security Chief of Staff that has operational control, and they have a unified logistics chain with standardized equipment just like NATO.

**Starfleet had a golden century of exploration between Kirk's time and TNG and it left them unprepared for war OR alternately the first Cardassian War was their Vietnam**

Ok so here me out. After the Klingon and Romulan neutral zones were established the Federation entered into a golden age of exploration and doubled its size in less than 100 years. In that time they adopted a military doctrine of parking a Battleship on your door to force you to the negotiating table.

All their major conflicts thus far had been resolved by negotiation so that became the Federations go to philosophy for fighting a galactic conflict. Starfleet switched to having a smaller number of technologically advanced and powerful ships meant to scare potential enemies into negotiating.

Meanwhile they kept a large number of older ships in reserve mothball that could be reactivated if a hot war broke out.

What happened in the first Cardassian war was that Starfleet got out maneuvered and played by an inferior force. Most Cardassian ships were no match for an Excelsior or similar ship of the line so they just gave the Starfleet ships a wide birth and never engaged them directly. Meanwhile they fought a bunch of ground wars where the odds were more even. The Federation by this point had grown too large and Starfleet hadn't grown adequately to protect it, so when a hot war broke out ships were either too far away exploring or they couldn't commit enough resources to the Cardassian sector without putting other sectors at risk.

The Federation council didn't consider this outright war (Police Action) so they didn't activate any of their reserves. Instead they negotiated. Ultimately the Cardassians negotiated away things of lesser value (like agreeing to pull out of Bajor to give the Federation a PR victory) while getting everything they wanted. They only fought battles for the planets that the Federation wouldn't give up.

The Cardassians toyed with the negotiations until they were in a perfect position and then sued for peace. The Federation declared victory anyway and all the colonists in the area were left going ""What the hell just happened?"" and formed the Maquis because the Federation failed to defend their interests. Meanwhile the Cardassians had no intention of keeping up their end of the bargain and violated the treaty all the time knowing the Federation would do anything up to ignoring what the Cardassians were doing to avoid starting another shooting war.

Ultimately it wasn't until the Borg crisis that the Federation finally woke up and realized they were in real trouble militarily.

The Galaxy class for all it's glory was a mistake, the result of bad military doctrine. A battleship in all but name that suffers from the Deathstar principal ""Commanders can't afford to use so called superweapons effectively, because they simply cannot afford to lose one""

Starfleet put children on the ships so that the explorers would feel more at home and make it less likely the ship would get attacked. But to quote Garak ""No, Humans have rules in war"", implying their enemies don't really care if there are civilians on board as the Jem'Hadar proved later on.

Starfleet kinda put all their eggs in one basket and lost 3 Galaxy class ships (Enterprise, Yamato, and Odyssey) within their first 10 years of service... for ships that were supposed to last 100 years or more.

This is also why Starfleet was struggling during the alternate timeline in Yesterday's Enterprise. Starfleet had missed out on 50-75 years of technological development related to warfare so they were caught on the back foot when the Klingon War started and they never really recovered.

**Worf is a paragon of Klingon tradition and honor because everything he knows about Klingons came from books**

Worf grew up with humans and learned everything he knows about his people from books and holovids. That's why he has such a skewed view about what Klingon culture is supposed to be like.

This resulted in him becoming a paragon of what the stereotypical Klingon is supposed to act like. Klingons both admire and hate him for it.

Picard was captain for seven years on TV. He's featured in three more seasons in a show named after him *in this decade.*

Everybody loves SNW and Pike. I predict SNW will go on for the traditional seven seasons. Who knows, maybe more.

Meanwhile, Kirk was on TV for just three seasons over fifty years ago. On a show that has not aged well in many ways. It's safe to say that a sizeable percentage of fans from then are no longer with us. 

Kirk is the very first captain in the very first show of the franchise. The only captain portrayed on screen for over 20 years. This gave the character cultural staying power. (Yes I know about Pike in the Menagerie and Decker but c'mon you know what I'm saying).

BUT Prime Kirk has not been on screen since 1994. I view the Kelvin movies like the Blade and Underworld movies. Made a whole lot of money at the time with no resonance in the present. I don't think most fans would care if there was never another Kelvin movie.

I'm not saying that people are going to literally forget the name of Kirk. Most will still know him as the OG captain. But over time will his prominence fade? 

I see him as the Adam West version of Batman. Sure people know about West's portrayal but most fans would not choose him as their favored Batman.

I can't remember anything too specific, but remember that it started off with the ship's Captain, who had an amazingly clear radio voice, and a younger companion, which I can't remember was male or female landing on a surface of a planet, and going to explore a mine on the planet. I don't remember much more than that, but in the episode listing, one of the episodes was about ghosts or some haunted place. 
I know my description is really vague, but hopefully someone here knows what I'm talking about. I've listened to a few different Star Trek radio series over the years, in hopes of finding it, but just can't seem to.

I didn‚Äôt get into TOS until I was a bit older

First Contact is my personal favorite out of any Trek movie. It seemed to have a strong focus throughout the entire film, The borg presence actually felt like a real threat, and the two main plot points wove together so well. It was just a solid Film.

Insurrection IMO is the weakest of the 4 and probably the one I have grown to look at as more of a extended episode of a Star Trek season than a movie. 

Nemesis is my third in line, it‚Äôs not an incredibly strong film, but the story seemed much more fleshed out than it‚Äôs predecessor and a good amount of character development was done to really help explain Shinzon and his motives. 

I‚Äôve recently been going back through all the movies and watching them in order ever since Picard season 2 ended and Strange New Worlds began.

I'm not saying this to defend New Trek or to demonize Old Trek, I just want to talk about this. Say what you will about New Trek. Say it's bad (Cuz it kinda honestly is), say it's cringeworthy, say it's weird, even say it would be better in animation, cuz it's true most of the time. But one thing you can not say is that it betrayed Roddenberry's vision, cuz if you wanna blame someone for that, ya gotta thank DS9... Matter of fact, let's jump back a few years back to the early seasons of TNG.

Y'all remember TNG's first seasons, right? The campy acting, the dull plots and annoying jerk characters. But the thing that no one apparently remembers is that Gene actually wanted it to be that way! So according to him, apparently in the 24th Century humans evolved so much that they would have no inside conflicts with each other, no witty banter like the Kirk era or anything fun like that. 

In fact, humans were apparently so perfect that they could be arrogant jerks all the time AND THEY WOULD STILL BE IN THE RIGHT! Of course, this behavior changed in season 2, when Gene basically left, and it basically extinguished itself around season 3, and in seasons 2 and 3 we actually got a lot of stuff that was actually good! We got Riker's beard, we got Best of Both Worlds, we got Picard's family, we got Deja Q, and, of course, we got DS9. 

The point is, if TNG still kept going on Roddenberry's vision it would have gotten cancelled pretty quickly. Matter of fact, it's why it's such a miracle we got the 6 other awesome seasons of TNG to enjoy today! And if DS9 also stuck with Roddenberry's vision, it probably wouldn't have been as fondly remembered as it is today.",startrek,"So, remember that time when Gene Roddenberry almost killed TNG?

Off topic but I accidentally started on the equinox episode and I got hooked so I started at the first season after that. The only thing I wish is that it wasn't so episodic because the show starts with a lot that don't seem to get resolved. I was disappointed that they didn't really do much with the Maquis or have a more structured story arc with the other caretaker. Also breaking up Neelix and Kes off-screen was disappointing to me because I wanted to see Kes taking the agency to do that herself and be more of a character beyond just being a nurse.

A story could be built around a super secret Section 31 eyes only event where the Borg nearly took over the department. You couldn't do it with Strange New Worlds without breaking canon. If this Borg survived the phaser blast, then it is alive and floating in space, if it didn't it's still floating in space indefinitely. Either way this Borg is valuable for it's technology alone at this time and in this quadrant of space. So what do you think? Can a Borg survive apart from the collective? not to mention floating in space indefinitely? Would seeing the Borg in ST Section 31 be a deal breaker or something you'd look forward to?",startrek,Wayward Borg Seeks Companionship

If you add in the context of the episode, with Keiko's malaise regarding giving up her career and then losing her school, it's even more frustrating. Miles suffers no disturbance in his own arrangements, but Keiko must maintain her domesticity even as she searches for renewed purpose in life.

1652832001,"So I'm working on a Star Trek story where a small star starship (like 75 - 100 person crew) is thrown back in time and crashes on a planet during its' bronze age.    


Now there are 2 complications to this situation. Firstly is where and when they crashed, relative to the evolution of the culture of the planet. Basically, imagine if Voyager crash landed 100 miles from the Battle of Thermopylae.     


Please note, I am **NOT** saying that this story takes place on earth or that the ship crashes in ancient Greece. I'm simply referencing the Battle of Thermopylae as a general equivalent for the point in the development of the cultures of the region.     


The second complication: The ship had recently captured a group of Nausican Pirates and they were being held in the brig when the ship crashed. The Nausicans revived before the Star Fleet crew and managed to escape.  The reason this is a complication is the leader of the group figures out what happened and that they've been thrown back in time a couple of thousand years. So he decides to make the best of it and begins working to establish a new Nausican Empire, well in spirit anyway. Obviously eventually these Nausicans will die off and they can't breed with the natives. The Nausican leader is just smart enough, and knows just enough, that with a couple of thousand-year head start, a couple of phasers, a tricorder or two, and even a rudimentary knowledge of the development of cultures and technology he can ultimately steamroll the native warlords and generals that would oppose him if he gets a couple of years to establish an economic and logistical base while he can easily entice the majority of other Warlords to join him.      


Let me clear about a couple of points: 

1. leaving the planet is not an option. The damage to the ship is pretty severe and the crew does not have access to the materials or tools to basically build a new drive section. They do not have any shuttles.  
2. Isolation isn't really viable for the Star Fleet crew. They crash in what is basically the most populated area of the world at this time, and they crashed next to one of the largest wars the planet had known up to that time. The only way to really isolate would involve hoofing it a couple hundred miles to the north which would require provisions, which would mean interacting with the locals... which would kind of defeat the purpose. Without the provisions, such a trek would effectively be a suicide march.  
3. I'm envisioning the Nausicans to be utterly brutal. Slavery, rule of might, strength of arms determining legitimacy, etc. They use all those sorts of things to build their empire. They're not interested in 'co-existing' with groups that don't share their worldview, and they view the last 300 years of Nausicans being reduced to pirates and thugs for hire as a personal insult that they intend to prevent from happening again.  
4. Initially the Nausicans are lead by a Ferengi who basically intends to do what Quark talked about doing in 'Little Green Men'. I am not saying he is nice; he does use underhanded negotiations, predatory business arrangements, and manipulations to start what he intended to be the foundation of a vast financial empire. Ultimately he underestimates the Nausicans and is removed from power (Killed? Escapes and joins with the Star Fleet crew? \*shrugs\*. Donno yet.) As I said, I am not defending the Ferengi as being nice or good. Simply establishing that for all the terrible things he does and sets in motion, the Nausicans are ten times worse.   

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my question: what do you think Star Fleet's prime directives would say about this sort of situation?

1652819584,"**Modern Star Trek has forgotten optimism which made the franchise great.** In modern society now, there's a feeling of pessimism. The days are truly past when humans perceived future with a sense of hope, now there is a sense of fear. The future is a place full of unknown, half formed terrors, while gradually becoming aware the evils of the past have stayed with us - prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, hatred - and the new Star Trek series' ethos has shown *it's no longer confident humanity can beat these challenges.*

Science-fiction has always served to showcase contemporary society, where sci-fi worlds may be fantastical, however they allow us all to understand contemporary issues. Symbolic of this, the last decade or so has given rise to dystopian futures, particularly geared towards a young adult audience. Oddly enough, these are performing better in the written form than they do in film and TV. These stories are actually quite subtle because they present bleak futures all too believable, and yet typically show a new generation confronting these ominous world systems. They are a strange blend of darkness and optimism because they at least suggest broken societies can be changed.

Given this context, Star Trek should be one of the most crucial sci-fi franchises of all. Gene Roddenberry knew how sci-fi worked, and **he believed his franchise had the power to confront and even transform society.** Unfortunately, the current writers and showrunners (and Hollywood in general) have struggled to present the same optimism.

Roddenberry was a humanist, and his optimism shaped Star Trek, by presenting our potential future, one where ***humanity had grown beyond petty segregation and self-interest.*** **Roddenberry's Star Trek declares humanity's best days are not behind us, they are ahead of us.** Star Trek (OS in particular) does not harp back to a romanticized, nostalgic portrait of yesterday. Also the values of tomorrow do not include nationalism, financial prosperity, identity politics, 'ism' ideologies, or power fantasies. There are still issues, but they arise from individual humans who are not ""elevating"", rather than from the system itself. This runs completely counter to modern pessimism - fear of the future, a nagging doubt about society's development. *Star Trek has become science fiction as counter-culture.*

**Unfortunately modern Star Trek, and a lot of shows remakes/sequels, have forgotten optimism, their roots and how to captivate the audience.** For example Star Trek Discovery showed the Federation at its worst, essentially modern society writ large. The idea of development and growth was no longer there, to the point the Federation considered an act of genocide. Worse still, the USS Discovery in the future is a lot more dystopian. Basically suggesting the Federation wasn't all great so did not last and is gradually being consigned to the history books.

Meanwhile, Picard season 1 was a story of nostalgia, with a corrupt Federation shown as villains at worst, antagonists at best. Picard desired doing good however he had failed and went into retreat mode. Even when Picard finally took to space again, he was driven more by a desire to do one last good thing than by a belief in the Federation. To make matters worse, his crew headed off on new adventures, independent from the Federation, perhaps still reluctant to trust an organization compromised by prejudice for decades (of course we know this never happened) effectively rewriting the history books. **Roddenberry believed in the slow march of forward progress**, he did not believe the future would flourish if we rewrote the past to try and appease or address a contemporary issue.

If the writers of modern Star Trek had any appreciation for science fiction, they would at the very least, get the continuity correct. It‚Äôs one thing to mess up the plot to ""refresh"" Star Trek for a modern day, mainstream audience. While personally this notion is completely unnecessary, you can at least get onboard with the idea. One cannot however have any respect for their complete lack of effort to ensure the principles, story and every other piece remained canon. They didn‚Äôt even do the easy stuff, like make technology remotely conform to pre-Kirk era Star Trek. If a science fiction writer with half the talent had actually done any research, this would be the first thing they did.

The writers and TV showrunners of today give us two options - ***they can appeal to the fans they have, offering a niche product which accommodates a smaller but very loyal fanbase, or ignore those fans and try to grow the fanbase in the hopes (hopes!) of bringing in more subscribers.*** In other words, they could settle for a small but loyal number of subscribers, or be greedy and bet the farm on trying to win over a large number of subscribers at the risk of turning away the loyalists. Guess which one they chose? Go on and guess! You guessed it, they chose the latter and failed heavily. *Furthermore, now in the show we get melodrama on all fronts!*

**When it comes to science fiction, Star Trek was always a space opera, but one with roots in hard science fiction.** This was always the fun of Star Trek. While we know a warp drive or replicators don‚Äôt really exist, the science is all there. It‚Äôs a big part of what enabled Star Trek fans to imagine a brighter future and even inspire future astronauts and scientists.

*""So in terms of sort of key influences, well I mean I certainly like Star Trek, because it actually shows like more of a utopian future, like it's not like, things aren't horrible in the future."" Elon Musk*

Who remembers Capt Kirk and Spock in gangster outfits? **""Kirk - Now you cooperate wid us and uh maybe we'll cut choo in fo a piece o dee action. Spock - A minuscule a very small piece.""** Effortless, the stories were striking and chemistry between characters was phenomenal.

The idea humanity will one day travel among the stars, discovering new life and new civilizations, boldly going where no one has gone before is a concept filling the world with the hope of a better tomorrow. The kind of tomorrow Captain Kirk was a part of. OS forever.",startrek,To boldly rewrite history and make science fiction counter culture...

1652724852,"As a lifelong fan of TNG I have had to deal with makeup redesigns of Klingons multiple times.  Luckily, each series  explains the differences in their storylines.  But for a long time I had to accept ST:TOS  Klingons looking different from ST:TNG because of production makeup costs and not because of an in-universe explanation.  ST:TOS looking different than ST:TNG has been explained in canon but so far no reason has been given to explain ST:DIS Klingons looking different (or JJ Abrams Klingons looking different in the Kelvin timeline, the timeline divergence from the Prime timeline alone is not a sufficient enough explanation).  So this is how I have come to rationalize why ST:DIS Klingons and JJ Abrams Klingons look different.  And also explain why the movie Klingons in Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country also look a little different.
As we all know, each of these different types of Klingon is due to different makeup companies doing Klingon prosthetics across the different productions of Trek.  But my in-universe canon explanation is that Klingons are composed of a Primary Klingon Species originating on Qo‚ÄônoS, and at least two subspecies of Klingons originating on worlds near Qo‚ÄôNos we have not seen yet in Prime timeline Trek.
The Primary Klingon Species from Qo‚ÄônoS has been the only Klingons shown in any iteration of Prime timeline Trek including ST:DIS(I will explain shortly).  We know from ST:ENT episode ‚ÄúBroken Bow,‚Äù the first encounter with the Primary Klingon Species looks like ST:TNG Klingons.  As explained in ST:ENT episode ‚ÄúAffliction,‚Äù the Klingons were experimenting with human Augment DNA which got loose in their population as a virus causing their population to get infected and take on the smooth-headed Klingon appearance seen in ST:TOS.  I totally bought this and it was a great episode of ST:ENT in its last season to fix canon before cancellation.  
The Augment Virus spread through the entire population of Qo‚ÄônoS making them all smooth-headed Klingons.  The Klingon Empire as we know is governed by the Klingon High Council.  The High Council is only composed of heads of the great houses of Qo‚ÄôNos, the houses who are regarded as having the most honor.  There is a whole tier to the Qo‚ÄôNos population that belong to the Lower Houses, who have little to no power in governing and are considered of lesser honor.  There are also the lower Servitude Class who are considered without honor.
We have seen some scientists and doctors in Klingon society, but the majority of Klingons dedicate their lives to gaining honor as warriors.  The Klingon High Council is a total kleptocracy and, using ships and technology obtained after repelling Hur‚Äôq invaders in Klingon Ancient times the Great Houses, conquered species off world and further acquired more ships and technology.  By ST:ENT 22nd century time frame the Great Houses have already gone through their Hur‚Äôq ships since they were ancient and Klingons had no way to repair or make new ones.
Between ST:ENT and ST:DIS the Great Houses conquer Klingon Subspecies 1 somewhere far from Federation borders.  Klingon Subspecies 1 look exactly like ST:DIS Klingons: big heads (normally bald), pointy fingernails, weird necks.  Not like the ST:TNG we had seen in ST:ENT up to this point.  The Great Houses considered Klingon Subspecies 1 a worthy adversary and with honor; not enough honor to ever belong to the Great Houses but enough honor to be higher than the Qo‚ÄônoS servitude class.  Klingon Subspecies 1 had driven off Hur‚Äôq invaders  and still had working Hur‚Äôq ships and the Qo‚ÄônoS Great Houses took them for their own and seen in ST:DIS Battle of the Binary Stars and through its season 1.  
Also, at this time the Great Houses looked at Klingons with smooth foreheads as without honor, and with disgust because of the resemblance to humans.  When the Great Houses conquered Klingon Subspecies 1 they also obtained technology to reset their genome, but the technology was limited to only setting a patients genome to Klingon Subspecies 1.  Klingons in the Great Houses had the means to alter their genome to appear like Klingon Subspecies 1 which they preferred over looking like humans.  For a longtime it was how the Great Houses distinguished themselves from the less honorable Lower Houses and the servitude classes of Qo‚ÄônoS.  
But as we saw in ST:DIS episode ‚ÄúPoint of Light,'' Klingons began building an Imperial Fleet of D7 battle cruisers that we are familiar with from ST:TOS.  I would like to think the D7s came from a species the Klingons conquered (and maybe partially conquered by the Romulan Empire explaining why we saw Romulan D7s in ST:TOS). The Imperial Fleet is composed of crew not from the Great Houses who still have their own fleets, but from smooth fore-headed Klingons from less honorable, weaker Lower Houses and servitude classes of Qo‚ÄôNos that the High Council built as a defense force in response to their losses in ST:DIS season 1.  
This is where I would like ST:SNW writers to address this.  Sometime during ST:SNW timeline, Klingons of the Great Houses acquire technology to reset their genome back to  their original ST:TNG looking selves.  Firstly, only the Great Houses have this technology; Lower Houses and servitude Klingons on ships in the Imperial Fleet serving as the Klingon Defense Force are all we have encountered in ST:TOS (hence only smooth fore-headed Klingons).  But as years progress more Klingons in the lower ranks get access to this medical technology and revert their appearance back to ST:TNG Klingons.  This could explain why Kore, Koloth, and Kang KDF Klingons with smooth foreheads in the ST:TOS by the time of ST:DS9 appear with forehead ridges again.  This can further explain why Klingons in Star Trek: Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country the look slightly different from ST:TNG Klingons.  It takes multiple treatments, the first few treatments are susceptible to slowly reverting to smooth Klingon headed foreheads due to remaining effects of the Augment Virtus in the Klingon population.  That would explain why Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek Undiscovered Country had less pronounced forehead and nose ridges compared to Chancellor K‚Äômpec in ST:TNG episode ‚ÄúSins of the Father‚Äù since by ST:TNG the Augment Virus is pretty much eliminated from Qo‚ÄônoS'.
I like the idea of a Klingon subspecies, it also helps explain why JJ Abrams Kelvin timeline Klingons look the way they do.  The Kelvin timeline Klingons (we have seen) are actually Klingon Subspecies 2, also conquered by Primary Species Klingons from Qo‚ÄônoS.  However, unlike Subspecies 1, Subspecies 2 is regarded as having little to no honor by the Great Houses of Qo‚ÄônoS; hence their place in the Klingon Empire as primarily Ground Troops which we haven‚Äôt seen in any of the Prime universe shows and movies.  Since Klingon Subspecies 2 have never served in the Imperial Fleet as part of the Klingon Defense Force, we have never seen them encountered by Federation Starfleet crews in the Prime timeline  and the only time we saw them depicted was as ground forces on Qo‚ÄôNos is in the Kelvin timeline in Into Darkness (excluding the JJ Abrams Star Trek 2009 cut scene). 
Subspecies are nothing new in Star Trek.  We know Remans are a subspecies of Romulans (or as I like to think of as a subspecies of proto-Vulcans).  Vulcan, Romulus, and Remus were all populated by common proto-Vulcan ancestors. We have also seen the Aenar, a subspecies of proto-Andorians.  Though not from canon, I would like to think of the Federation aligned Caitians as a subspecies of proto-Kzin (just like their Klingon serving sibling species the Fehreki in Star Trek Online).  The three Klingon species in Star Trek all derive from a common proto-Klingon species, an idea of proto species is they could have populated worlds before being warp capable.  The next question is: How were they dispersed across different worlds?  STO: Preservers?  Maybe by ST:TAS Slavers?  The idea there could have been explained by advanced races like Preservers and Slavers moving bipedal humanoid species around post Progenitors has tons of story potential.
I apologize if this is a long-protracted explanation, but for me this backstory is the most complete to explain all iterations of Klingons we‚Äôve seen in Trek.  My only hope is that in ST:SNW we begin to see an explanation for ST:DIS versus ST:TNG and ST:TOS Klingons.  It does not have to be a complete explanation, but some hints dropped here and there in season 2 and beyond.  
From the leaked photo of the Undiscovered-Country-looking Klingon in season 2, I would hope the ST:SNW writer's explanation aligns with my thoughts.  I think my theory of three species of Klingons in the Primary timeline is sound, and that the Primary Klingon Species on Qo‚ÄônoS originally looked like ST:TNG Klingons but because of the Augment Virus and later by genome resequencing to look like Klingon Subspecies 1, we have seen a total of 3 main Klingon looks in Prime timeline trek.

Is Coda  saying that all novels and TV series after Star Trek VIII: First Contact are in an alternate (prime) timeline?

If that is the case, then how do the Discovery and Picard series exist? If the Discovery and the Picard series are in the prime timeline, do we expect those characters to have had generally the same experiences that we've read about thus far? Or is everything completely different?  And we'll just learn about their histories from bits and pieces on the series?

Does anyone know if there are more planned novels that take place in the so-called prime timeline that happened after Star Trek 8?

Warning: SNW spoilers ahead. 


I love Ethan Peck as Spock and Anson Mount as Captain Pike. Celia Rose Gooding is amazing as Uhura too. The human kiss between Spock and T'Pring confused me. I'm sure Vulcans can kiss the human way, but I thought they would also kiss the Vulcan way too. That seems to be lost in this show.

1652534768,"Lots of spoilers 

Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love all Start Trek. From TOS to the animated series through TNG and all of the movies all the way up Discovery and Picard and now SNW. I love it all, warts and all.

But the effusive praise here so far for SNW is bothering me. In the three episodes so far all we have seen are retreads of old plotlines from other series. The Enterprise shows up to mediate a conflict on an alien world, the Enterprise shows up to help move a celestial body before it destroys some alien world, the Enterprise gets some sort of virus that affects the crew and almost destroys the ship. All done before.

And again, I like the show so far. But people here are giving it nothing but praise where the slightest bit of nonsense from Picard or Discovery gets multiple threads trashing those shows for ""not being Star Trek"" or ""not making sense"" or ""not being canon"". Meanwhile in the first episode of SNW we have a civilization that creates a ""warp bomb"" simply by observing what happened to Discovery. And then Pike solves a bitter global conflict by presenting a short PowerPoint about what happened on Earth.

Episode two is, again, just a rehash of old celestial body threatens to destroy a planet/civilization unless good old Star Fleet comes up with a last second solution. It's been done to death.

And now with the preview from the latest episode the crew catches some virus that threatens the entire ship. Hard to judge an episode from a short clip, but it certainly looks like it's a rehash of episodes from several other series.

Once again, I like SNW. But I also really like Disco and Picard yet they have been torn apart over and over again for the same kinds of things that we are already seeing in SNW. I know it's familiar because of the known characters and the serialization. And I'm ok with that. But let's not pretend that they're doing something special or original with it so far. Because they aren't.",startrek,Strange New Worlds rose colored glasses

Also, aside from the Flight Attendant, he doesn't seem to have anything else he's working on. He seems to have a great fondness for both the set and the character.

It really felt like all these negative reviews were just a way for some people to be racist, and or sexist. And why? Because there are more women in the main cast?  just because they gave Uhura a backstory???  (I feel that that backstory was long overdue by the way.)

Obviously, nothing in this book is canon. It's a work of fan fiction, albeit extremely detailed. Nevertheless I find it very interesting as an example of early Star Trek Fandom in the mid-70s. 

This was a time when TOS and TAS were literally it when it came to Trek. There were no movies or other shows. No Picard, no Enterprise refit. No Bajorans, Cardassians, Trill, or Ferengi. 

What's shown instead is a very different galaxy than what eventually took shape. There are numerous planets, political boundaries, governments, etc. That made no appearances in any of the canon material.

As a Trek fan who grew up in the 90s with TNG, this felt in many ways very alien to me, no pun intended. It kind of feels like reading the first draft of the first Star Wars movie knowing how what the franchise actually ended up becoming.

1652456362,"With this week's comet episode we've started a pattern where Sam Kirk does something risky on the landing party, gets knocked out and almost killed, which demonstrates risky stakes and focuses the rest of the landing party on the crisis.

Dramatically speaking, this serves an identical story purpose as the many individual landing party redshirt deaths, followed by McCoy's famous ""He's dead, Jim,"" accompanied by a dramatic music sting leading into the commercial break.

This time, using Sam to fill that role, they even had to resuscitate him, because his heart had stopped (he had, quite literally, died, Jim).

I think this trend should continue. Not only does it help maintain the classic story structure that fans have shown they're desperately in love with, it replaces a tacky repetitive trope having an awkward cumulative death count (that wouldn't play well with Pike's arc) with an adorable and lovable recurring gag, and a character trait for Mr. Kirk.

I have a serious question that I have wondered all my life about‚Ä¶ well just about every Star Trek tv show or movie I‚Äôve ever seen ‚Äî and heck even The Orville ‚Äî

I love these types of shows but I‚Äôve never been one to take huge dives into the ‚Äúlore‚Äù or whatever you would call it. 

My question(s) is(are),

Who mans the bridge of the ships at night or when the main crew is asleep? Do they just shut the ship down and have someone sit there and watch the bridge in case anything happens?

Or is there a 2nd shift and third shift crew?

Is the ship always traveling flying since it takes so long to get places? 

I‚Äôm assuming there is a night/secondary command crew (not led by a captain or first officer‚Ä¶ so who leads that and what is their rank?) and if the ship runs into trouble they hold things down until the main crew can muster to the bridge?

Now that would be a great sci-if comedy‚Ä¶ a show about ‚Äúthe other guys and gals‚Äù that have boring ‚Äúnight‚Äù duty and never do the fun missions like the main bridge crew but have to take over when they are off saving a planet or fighting somebody.",startrek,"Help me Trekkies, you‚Äôre my only hope."

But as I've given the show a second chance, which I also didn't care for, I've not only grown to love the show but the Cerritos and California class in general! What helped was Spacedock pointing out how it's meant to look like something that was kitbashed for a background shot in TNG. I still think it's ugly and shitty, but it's the kind that's got charm and character, just like the great state it's named after!

It was so refreshing to see actors just having a dialog, developing charters and acting. And they had a few of those moments. Whole segment on the surface of the comet was great and of course it was [Uhura and Spock who figured out that singing was the key](https://youtu.be/QDTS8U0Uawk). I'm still puzzled why they just suddenly removed their helmets at one point and I don't really buy [Spock slicing the comet with his shuttle](https://c.tenor.com/CbSB1GH8PgEAAAAC/larrydavid.gif), but otherwise it was a really solid episode.

In the real world, the stress and pressures of this role contributed to her divorce from politician Jack Ryan. Also, in the real world, sordid details about the divorce would come out when Jack Ryan was running for the US senate. He eventually dropped out of the race. Who ended up winning the seat he ran for? Barack Obama. In the real world, of course, Obama would rapidly ascend  to the Presidency from the Senate. 

In the Star Trek universe, Jerri Ryan never got a big role and never divorced Jack. Jack went on to win his senate seat and Barack Obama stayed an obscure Illinois official. 

In the 2008 Democratic primary, John Edwards became the anti-Hilary protest candidate. He went on to win the nomination and was at first a huge favorite to win the election against John McCain. Therefore, McCain still selected Sarah Palin as his running mate in a Hail Mary. 

But in an October Surprise, Edward‚Äôs mistress spoke out before the election and all of Edward‚Äôs malfeasance came out. He went on to lose to McCain.

1652318627,"Right now, I think Paramount+ has a winning strategy having 4 Star Trek series in production.  Every week we get a new episode of Star Trek which keeps me subscribed to Paramount+ year-round.  Can't say the same yet for Disney where there are gaps between new Star Wars and Mavel series.  I'm sure this has been the strategy of Paramount+ all along and with Picard ending next year to keep the year solid with new Trek I would hope Alex Kurtzman and his teams are close to beginning production of yet another Star Trek series to air in the same year as Strange New Worlds third season and Discovery's sixth season.

So what would your preferred next Star Trek series be?  I personally want to see continuation in the prime timeline following the events of Picard.  I would love to see an Enterprise-F set series, possibly starting with Worf as Captain but then transitioning command to another captain in case actor Michael Dorn does not want to star on an ongoing series again.  Or a USS Stargazer series with Jeri Ryan as captain.  Episodic like how Strange New Worlds but with character arcs spanning episodes like the best episodes of Deep Space Nine did in the 90s.  As much as I love Strange New Worlds I grew up with Next Generation and the Star Trek universe I most appreciate is the timespan Picard is continuing following TNG-DS9-VOY.  For me that's the most lived in fully realized Trek universe over the Kelvin timeline and the prequel series and for me where I want to see more stories set in.  What's other people's thoughts.

Plot Summary:

&gt;!Sabotage at Niqa-Con!  While Cloudio, Sinclair, and Skirmish are  discussing the dos and don'ts of guild meet and greets with the talented  Joyful Babette her fellow artist Quixotic bursts into the auditorium  declaring that their gorgeous costumes have been ruined with only a few  hours before the start of the Niqa-con talent show! (With a grand prize  of 20,000 gold pieces to the winning party).  Suspecting foul play the  group searches for clues but comes up with only a pair of leads,  mysterious golden dust that seems to melt into the skin, and a tablet  with the idol group Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph taunting  whoever views the tablet.  Conferring with the con's organizer, Rictavio  Bittercorn, they are charged with escorting the Hippogryphs out of the  convention.  The only problem...no one knows where they are currently  holed up, due to their idol status they keep a very low profile prior to  performances and layers of secrecy to keep their privacy.  Fortunately  Mr. Bittercorn knows a superfan and convinces her to help the Kittens  find the Hippogryphs.  Roxanne Dang is quite possibly the BIGGEST fan of  the Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph in all of Jishoap, having  intimate knowledge of each of the three remaining members (Eun-hyung,  Mozart, and Bam), their various songs and routines; along with theories  about the future career of the recently departed Hippogryph who is  starting a solo project.  She also reveals that the group has said there  will be a huge announcement at today's performance.!&lt;

&gt;!Running through some ideas and leads the group decides the first  task should be righting the wrong that Joyful has suffered which means  heading to the crowded con floor.  They start by visiting Sinclair's  friend, Professor Jubilheim, at Booth 24, and asking her to investigate  the tablet.  While it appears to have been tampered with to show the  taunting message it does little to alleviate the group's suspicions  towards the Hippogryphs.  Bringing the abjurationist back to the room  filled with scraps of fabric Jubilheim is able to repair the costumes  and the Kitten's receive 500 gold each as a token of gratitude from the  artists.  Not wanting to risk further foul play to ruin Joyful's day  Skirmish and Claudio get the attention of wrestling super star Hulk  Harlan and after a meet and greet with the legend hire him to stand  guard in front of Joyful's studio until the show begins.  Bringing the  tested fighter, and dozens of fans, between any would be costume killers  and Joyful's work.  Through all of this Roxanne is insufferably  antagonistic towards the Kittens, going to great length's to point out  how the adventuring guild is not nearly as great as the stories would  have many believe, and the the Hippogryphs are talent incarnate.!&lt;

&gt;!With Joyful's assets now safe the trio decide to try a lead of  Roxanne's, a hot dog vendor going by the name of Matt Stone.  While he  is none to happy to be approached by her again as the man seems to have  knowledge of the Hippogryph's whereabouts, he eventually gives up the  information when Skirmish raises the demand to new heights.  The idol  group is using Locker Room 4A under the alias of Deep Ooze.  While  Roxanne is over the moon to finally meet her favorite performers in the  entire world, Skirmish, Claudio, and Sinclair are eager to get the group  out of the con, receive a reward, and try their hand at winning 20,000  gold themselves.  After failing to impersonate security Skirmish forces  the door open and everyone meets the Four Kings of the Prancing  Hippogryph.  Much to everyone's surprise the idols are not only  accomplished performers but incredibly dangerous combatants!  Realizing  that the aggression is due to the Hippogryphs thinking that they were  rabid fans and the group wanting their privacy Sinclair deescalates the  situation by banishing Skirmish to a pocket plane of existence.  With  everyone cooling down after a moment the idols decide to resolve this  dispute with a dance battle.  The three Firebreathing Kittens versus  their super fan Roxanne.  Gyrations are thrown, knives are juggled,  splits are attempted, but in the end the battle is decided by Sinclair's  interpretive dance involving their newfound ability to merge with  Malachai.  Impressed by everyone's talent the Hippogryphs decide to hear  out the adventurers.!&lt;

&gt;!After some back and forth and new information coming forward  about how widespread the Ekenblim Dust is, the Firebreathing Kittens  convince the idol group that it would be in their best interest to go to  Mishui and meet with Barry the Artificer, and conveniently getting OUT  of the convention in the process.  By this point Sinclair, Skirmish, and  Slaudio have grown to have a respect for the idols and are more  understanding as to why Roxanne is such a huge fan of the group.   After sending Matti off to let Mr. Bittercorn know that the Hippogryphs  are leaving the convention they sneak the group out of the building.   Unfortunately everyone is barely two steps outside before an elvish  looking Ekenblim dashes in, grabs the performers, and whisks them  through a magic circle while taking the dust!  Putting two and two  together the Firebreathing Kittens calm a grieving Roxanne, head  straight to the con managers office, and have Skirmish bash down the  door.  Before them is Mr. Bittercorn talking with the Ekenblim from  earlier, both surprised to see a missing door.  The Ekenblim flees  through the magic circle in the office and before the con manager can  react the Kittens and Roxanne follow!!&lt;

&gt;!On the other side the find themselves in a beautiful office with a  pair of the other worldly creatures celebrating a job well done, and  the three Hippogryphs frozen by a spell.  In the ensuing fight Bam is  freed and slays both Ekenblim in a surprisingly brutal fashion and is  shaken.  Bloodied but alive, everyone is teleported back to Locker Room  4A.  Rushing back to the office to confront Rictavio they find the  office empty, except for various valuable that the adventurers decide to  liberate from the villains place of business.  Hearing that the talent  show has started the Hippogryphs and Kittens rush to the stage and make  an announcement that Mr. Bittercorn is wanted for questioning,  unfortunately the businessman made himself scarce before the show  started.  The day culminates in Roxanne, The Firebreathing Kittens, and  The Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph giving a dazzling performance  in front of the enthralled con goers.  The grand prize is awarded to  them and the Hippogryphs announce that their newest member is none other  than Roxanne, who is left almost speechless with excitement.!&lt;

First the entire end for Pike in season two of Discovery. The writers quite literally made the concept of being wheelchair bound into a straight horror trope. The primal scream was the most anti Star Trek moment I as a disabled Star Trek fan ever saw.  


Second was on SNW where Pike tells Spock he 'knows exactly where and how he'll die'. Dude you aren't dying you're just gonna end up in a wheelchair. Shit happens.

I think ""Hit It"" is just too informal for a captain to be saying and hearing Pike say that also made me laugh (although I feel like it makes sense in the SNW's humorous context and could also make sense as Starfleet protocols may not have been as formal and developed in the early days as compared to Picard's era).

1652207012,"TLDR: \~3000AD Klingons from eras past are brought forward and have to integrate in a high tech egalitarian futuristic Klingon society.

Longer:

Klingons have many cultural touch stones, but you can see some of their history as modeling the Scandinavian Viking culture of raiding and exploring, and then integrating into other cultures, and possibly in the far future becoming like modern Scandinavia with a multicultural egalitarian society.

Modeling off of the series structure in the TV series Beforeigners where people from older eras are brought to the present you could do a similar series structure for a Klingon series.

A Klingon series taking place far in the future \~3000AD which is before The Burn 

A Temporal War attack on the time crystals Klingons have access to causes thousands, maybe millions of Klingons from many eras of time to be pulled forward hundreds or thousands of years to the 'present'.  Their modern society would have to learn to integrate with their culture.

Worf or his son Alexander could be the POV character a Klingon out of time.  He would be famous and infamous for some of the things he has done or thought to have done, and how that is thought of in the future.

You can get ancient Klingons from Kahless' time and ones from the time of TOS and the first war with the Federation.  Of course you get Klingons from the time of TNG and the it can be decided how to treat the periods between TNG/DS9/VOY and 3000AD. They have 600 years to play with.

&gt;!When Wil talks about being a part of some Traveler/Watcher organization and how the universe is a risk of unraveling and its their job to ensure that its all protected and yadda yadda... I couldn't help but feel a bit discouraged by the notion that the universe is following some grand moral arc being curated by a group or individuals.

1652198337,"Or why didn't all the deaths in 2024 screw up the timeline? 

Forgive me if this gets a bit out there. I'm making suggestions, not declaring that I know the writers' intent. 

There have been lots of complaints made about going from worrying about butterflies to leaving a pile of dead 21st century humans and no one worried what Rios staying behind might do to the timeline. 

The answer is in the bullet holes in Chateau Picard. Picard remembered them from when his ancestors resettled, and is reassured this means ""they are on the right path."" For the bullet holes to be there, in the exact location, all of the events in 2024 had to have transpired exactly as they did, including the deaths.   


So that covers everything that happened up to that point not altering the timeline. What about Rios?   


I think it was part an acceptance that is everything thus far had been part of the ""right path"" then Rios staying may well have been as well. After all, until Q offered to send them back, they thought they all were going to live out the rest of their lives in the 21st century, and this must have been part of how it played out. 

But there is a choice. Rios could have gone back, but he didn't, and no one tried to compel him because of potential damage he might do to the timeline.   


This is, I think, Picard's real final gift to Q - an act of faith. Picard, at long last, truly believes that Q is doing right by humanity and it will all be OK. There's no more questioning his motivations, or his apparent lack of value for sentient life. When Picard questions Q on why Tallin had to die and he says ""She always dies, but this is the only timeline where she meets Renee"" it all comes together. Not only does Q care, but he knows them, he knows them all. He knows their lives, their desires, their potential futures. He exists with the burden of knowing that sometimes the Edith Keelers have to die so that much more horrible futures don't come to pass. He knows that a meaningful life is more than just how much time passes on a clock between birth and death.   


Picard finally trusts Q, understands him, knows that he is not unknowable.   


Beyond Rios and the deaths, the implications of the predestination paradox are far reaching. Q didn't just have his hand on the scale in All Good Things. The entire Star Trek timeline is the result of Q having his hand on the scale all along. Everything we've ever seen, perhaps even the creation of the Federation itself, was Q guiding humanity towards it's best possible self.

In true Q fashion, this benefits him directly. It is this timeline's Janeway who acts as arbiter in allowing Quinn to choose to end his existence. It is Janeway who intervenes in the resulting Q civil war, and ultimately the reason there's a Q Jr. out there, somewhere.   


Putting humanity on course to become its best self resolved the ultimate existential crisis of the Q, and having completed the loop, Q is able to move on past this existence.",startrek,Picard S2 - Butterflies vs Predestination

1652195292,"As a prelude, there will be no spoilers for current seasons of Trek in this post. I will comment on the general structure of Season 2 of Picard and Season 4 of Discovery, but will not talk about any story or plot elements.

I have what might be an unpopular opinion. Star Trek should be serialized. Deep Space 9's 5th and 6th seasons are, in my opinion, the best television the Star Trek Franchise has ever put to screen. This being said, serialization requires good implementation, and I feel that Star Trek is struggling at structuring and implementing the stories they want to tell.

Good television structure generally gives a clear structure to every episode. Each should contain a well defined setup, conflict, and resolution, while still contributing to the overall story. Deep Space 9 does this very well. Every episode, with the exception of 2 parters, has it's own story to tell. The biggest weakness of Deep Space 9 is it's filler. Despite it's strengths as an individual episode, ""Far Beyond The Stars"" contributes nothing to the overall plot (at least until it was retroactively written in the the Emissary plot in Season 7). I'm not saying that ""Far Beyond The Stars"" should not have been made, but rather it could have been stitched into Season 6 better than it is. It is still a fabulous episode.

Now that that is made clear, lets talk season long plotlines. I actually feel the best season long plot Star Trek has produced is Enterprise's Xindi arc. Other than a few occasions, each and every episode advances the plot while being self contained. I do feel that there are flaws, the season's pacing is hit or miss and still has a bit more filler that isn't integrated well. Overall though, it's a good season of television.

Now to talk a little bit about modern Trek.

Disco Season 4 starts out really strong. We are introduced to the season plot in the first episode. We get a little filler in the first half of the season, but otherwise, the episodes are well written, self contained, and still advance the season's story. This falls apart later in the season, and by the end of the season, plot points that should take minutes are stretched out to 50 minute episodes. Herein lies the biggest issue with serialized Trek.

Outside of a few situations (2 part episodes) every episode should tell it's own story. Discovery fails at this. It's not the fault of the story the writers wanted to tell. It's a structural problem. IMO, Discovery's 4th season tells a good story. It just should have been several episodes shorter. 

And Picard. IMO, Picard Season 2 felt like a 2 part episode or movie that had been stretched beyond belief. The first episode could have stood on it's own, followed by your standard TNG 2 part structure, and the same story could have been told. In all, I believe that Picard Season 2 told a story that could have been told in less than 3 hours of television while still hitting every plot point.

When 3 episodes worth of content are spread out over 10 episodes, pacing becomes a major issue. In addition, plot holes become way bigger issues that they should be. When a plot hole isn't addressed in a 2 parter, it's generally a ""Huh, that's weird?"" moment. When a plot hole isn't addressed, and instead reinforced over a span of 10 episodes, it becomes a glaring issue.

In all, I think both the most recent seasons of Picard and Discovery had stories to tell that were 100% worth telling. They were just executed badly. In Discovery's case, it leads to awkward pacing, and entire episodes that feel like they should have lasted 10 minutes. In Picard's case, it leads to a plot that spins its wheels for 7 episodes in a row.

In conclusion, Star Trek should be serialized (in some cases, I'm totally okay with Strange New Worlds being episodic), but in serializing a show, it cannot forget to tell meaningful stories in every episode. The end of an episode should feel like our hero's have done something. Some meaningful task, something worthy of our time, was completed, or failed. The fact that this isn't happening in recent Trek seasons has been a severe detriment to the overall quality of the shows.

TLDR: Star Trek's serialized seasons have failed at structuring individual episodes, and this has caused entire seasons to suffer from bad pacing, story issues, and less than satisfying solutions.",startrek,(No Spoilers) Serialized Star Trek's biggest weakness.

YOUNG PICARD: And can we talk about Picard as a child? I've never seen such a shining example of a kids role written by someone who doesn't have kids. That boy was 10yo, completely obedient, never said more than two words, and was very clearly emotionally stunted.... I got severe aspergers vibes from the kid, possibly autism. And this kid is the same that joins the academy, gets stabbed by a naussican, and becomes the captain of the federation flagship? Do they not do psych evals? 
Nothing against the actor, he's just reading lines. But to me the kid we saw is not the man we know.


RIOS: How did they manage to completely drop the ball with the only character that deserved a spinoff? It's a crime that we now won't get Captain Rios on the Stargazer. Truly one if the best actors in this show. They should have brought his gf and her son to the 24th century. Though I'll take Captain Hansen as a second option I guess.


BORG: I guess we are falling into the further neutralization of the galaxy's biggest threat. So the borg are now a voluntary force, that is ""guarding"" some ""galactic event"" that is no bigger than a small fleet of ships. Ok. What a waste of narrative potential. We could have had a season long borg battle, but instead we get queen jurati.

After a misunderstanding with the Borg they get popped in to the Confederation (Timeline? Universe?) by Q who after a chat and a slap with Picard, he says this is humanity‚Äôs fault. After bluffing their way through their mirror selves lives, they reconvene then go back in time with the Borg queen to go back to their future.

As they stumble around the 21st century Q pops in and out and keeps the story interesting. During one of these visits it is established he is dying of old age, which is unexpected for a near omnipotent entity. After the team finish patching up the timeline, Q confirms his destiny with Picard and resides himself to his fate. Q hugs his mortal bestie then sends everyone back to the future.

When the team wakes up in the right spot, they realise the Borg Queen is their 400 year old friend Agnes and her collective of Borg volunteers. She tells them the galaxy is gonna explode or something and she needs their ships to make a shield umbrella. They work together, save the day and make the Borg protectors of the galaxy.

So why was Q involved?

We know that the continuum the Q reside in has affects on our universe in one form or another. This was seen in Voyager during the Q Cold War where their weapons used on each other were causing Supernova‚Äôs (Supernovi?) in our universe.

It is also mentioned that Q can be killed, as indicated in the same episode from Voyager as well as Picard. Other Q have been killed too however they had taken on the forms of other life forms. For example,the ones from TNG that had a baby as humans, died as humans, but had Q powers pass on to their child. Another was the Q found by Janeway in Voyager wanting to die but was denied it by the continuum, so he got turned into a human and committed suicide.

1652163992,"What was the point/purpose of FBI Agent Wells section of Picard Season 2?  It might have been cliche to have him show up in the finale to help in some way (helping with security, giving Renee a pep talk, etc.), but at least it would have helped me feel he was somewhat meaningful.  As it is, it seemed kind of wasted.

Picard learned Q was dying, but only indirectly and not from Wells.  Shouldn't there have been some easier way for Q to get in touch with them rather than being in a FBI interrogation room?

How does Picard change from hearing/helping Wells understand what happened with the failed mind meld?  It kind of fits with Picard remembering/dealing with the memory of his mother, but that seemed more like Picard ""suppressing"" what happened whereas Wells ""couldn't"" have understood what happened.  Maybe it was just obvious that ""Picard helping Wells with his truth/past made Picard understand that he needed to address his own truth/past"", and only dummies like me wanted it spelled out more clearly.

Does Wells benefit in some way from knowing the truth?  His failed investigation to reveal Picard as an alien (he merely was a time-traveling flesh and blood android) got him fired from the FBI.  Did he develop a successful business on his own?  Did his family life improve/develop, having or reconciling with a spouse/children/other people who had felt pushed away by his alien obsession?  Did he help cure the oceans, too?

Was it meant to prevent the audience from asking why some sort of law enforcement wasn't investigating the crew for their actions (like commandeering a police car) during the season?  Potential investigators would see the ""alien crazy"" FBI agent was involved and thus just want to avoid it, so they didn't investigate Agnes for the bar window or the dead guy?  That might have made a little sense earlier in the season, but Wells appeared in episodes 7 and 8.

Finally, was there supposed to be a current world comparison (e.g. in season 1, the Romulans on the relocation planet standing for immigrants or refugees)?

Thank you.",startrek,Purpose of FBI Agent Wells in Picard?
1652159152,"For those who don't know, the Phage is a disease that has ravaged the Vidiian species for over two millennia. It breaks down their tissues and organs at the cellular level and they are forced to rely on organ transplants to survive, which leaves many looking like cobbled-together corpses with mottled black and grey flesh in various stages of decay.

Horrifying yes but as a biologist I have wondered how the heck does such a disease actually work. Pathogens, the agents of disease, don't infect their hosts to kill them but to propagate themselves. Killing their hosts, or hindering them from interacting with other hosts, would not really augment this goal. That's not to say that lethal pathogens can't exist obviously, but the rate that they kill their hosts must be slower than the rate they infect new ones, which is usually possible with high population densities. But we know from Denara Pel that public gatherings are limited in many places, which would inhibit the spread of such a disease. So if that's true, how can it still be so present?

Also, pathogens are more easily spread when the host does not appear to be ill, which is one of the reasons Ebola didn't become a global pandemic: the hosts display serious symptoms right as they are at their greatest pathogen load, and thus their maximum capacity to spread the pathogen. This means that people recognize they are severely ill and can more easily avoid them. And having mottled putrid flesh is usually NOT a sign of being in great health.

Lastly, how has the population failed to adapt genetically to the disease? The first ones to succumb would be those with weaker or less adaptable immune systems, leaving those more resilient to the pathogen to reproduce and pass on their advantages to the next generation. Thus there would be this arms race between the host and the pathogen, with neither truly able to overtake the other. Highly lethal and/or virulent diseases can't really sustain themselves in the long haul, as they kill off the more susceptible hosts too quickly for them to reproduce, and their mutation rate is not high enough to adapt to more resilient immune systems. A great example is the 1918 Flu Pandemic, which eventually ended when so many people died the virus could not find enough hosts to sustain itself.

After pondering over the Phage, I realized that there WAS a historical precedent for such a disease: tuberculosis. Ancient skeletons, predating metal-working, ceramics, and literacy, have been found with tell-tale signs of tuberculosis infection. Moreover, tuberculosis used to be called consumption after the way it seemed to eat the victim from within, and what does phage mean? To eat.

How has tuberculosis survived as long as it has despite our best efforts to cure, treat, and even eradicate it? Tuberculosis has a number of advantages over other pathogens, which I will list down below.

1. Tuberculosis is often asymptomatic, meaning patients can carry and transmit the disease without showing symptoms, allowing them to pass it on without anyone knowing.
2. Tuberculosis can also develop differently, with some people suffering for years before dying while others go into a remission for a decade after a long period of illness only to suddenly take a turn for the worse.
3. The pathogen responsible for tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is surprisingly adaptable, and can enter a dormant stage when presented with antibiotics. And if a patient fails to complete their course of treatment, which can take weeks or months, it can return resilient to the antibiotics.

So perhaps the Phage works in a similar manner to tuberculosis. The Vidiians suffering the worst effects may simply be ""used goods"" in the eyes of the pathogen, and the majority of the population are already infected but asymptomatic. 

Now are there holes in this theory? Probably yes. But it seems like such a good fit at this point in time that I had to get it out.",startrek,Phage is Alien Tuberculosis

His commanding officer is  Benjamin Maxwell and the two of them along with other crew mates from the Rutledge would be the main cast with a new Cardassia Overseer who would be the main antagonist.

1652136532,"Recently finished Picard S2 and one aspect ticked me off in particular: The shallowness in how the show tackles real world problems. Hear me out.

Science fiction is meant to make creative analogies to point at bad things in our everyday life and make us consider. Old Star Trek did this in great detail, dedicating whole episodes towards hot topics of the time. In Picard S2 we mainly have two such themes: (US) immigration issues &amp; climate change. But how are these handled?

Rios is detained by comic-like evil ICE agents which besides their evilness have no other defining character traits to them. The plot line ends with our heroes defeating the guards of one ICE truck, freeing all passengers. That's it. No deeper exploration of how xenophobia built these structures, no discussion about how xenophobia might be irrational but a very human thing.

Climate change and its threat to modern civilization is mentioned multiple times throughout the season, but ultimately told to be solved using &gt;!a miracle microbe found by the Europa mission!&lt;. Really? What is this telling the viewers? ‚ÄúYou don't have to change your behaviour, use less resources, or be more mindful with the planet you have, because eventually some new miracle tech might fix everything.‚Äù

1652123899,"In Far Beyond the Stars we get the implication that all of Star Trek (or at least DS9) is in the mind of a 1950s fiction writer.

Assuming that is true and at some point after his incarceration his work is finally published in the 1960s then it stands to reason it would be hugely popular and quickly garner a massive fan base... Afterall, we're told how incredible Bennys work is during the episode.

Doesn't it stand to reason that having read the few DS9 stories by Benny that other young writers (possibly boys looking like Jeffery Hunt and William Shatner) might be inspired to co-write their own stories. These stories do well and eventually by the 1970s young Jimmy writes a couple of novels about the adventures of the enterprise.

In France a French boy is scribbling stories inspires by Jimmy's stories and then back in America, a boy in New Orleans (also called Benny) tries to continue the Benny Russell stories while a girl is transporting her story to the other side of the galaxy. A little later, a well loved actor decides to set stories before the Jimmy Shanahassy stories.

Things go quiet for a few years until a group of fans decide to work together with their own stories. A girl is inspired writes redemptive stories from the perspective of a federation prisoner, they all work together on a series of funny short stories that just make them roll on the floor laughing.

The little girl (Kate, now a grown woman with children) who wrote the stories across the other side of the galaxy decides to write some fun adventures inspired by her children. And the French boy uses his life experiences to tell how the further adventures of captain of the original spin-off. Finally, Chris Jr finds his dad's original stories and decides to write stories of his own.

It's a nice story. But what's even better, it answers every continuity error between series.

The ship that the Enterprise was rescuing was empty when we arrived there, where tf was the crew at, afaik Pike only rescued like 2.5 officers, are we to believe that the ship of that size can be run by just three people or did the captain just take the entire crew for an unannounced holiday to the planet ?

Were also not introduced to a single character other than the ones that we already somewhat know from other tv series and honestly the bridge crews in the late Star Trek series look like they've all been written exactly the same and they're waaaay too comfortable on the bridge, take for example the ensign communication officer, she literally smiles and handles the console like a senior and talks to the captain like if they were good friends despite just meeting him, there is no humanity in that, she just extremely confidently answers everything and does her job perfectly just like every other cloned officer on that bridge.",startrek,Star Trek: Strange New Worlds rant
1652114074,"I really liked the intro of new character of La'an, and the bit of mystery about her ""file"".

She references being the sole survivor of a colony ship that was captured by the Gorn. However, in ""Arena"" it appears that Kirk's encounter is first contact with the Gorn. So why would Kirk have not known about the Gorn if Starfleet already had an officer who had been a captive as a child?  

I think it might be a good indicator that her ""colony ship"" was on one of the sister ships of the Botany Bay. These ships left Earth carrying augments in stasis secretly in the 1990s, and their locations were known only to section 31. However, Section 31 did not share that information with Kirk, despite the possibility that he would encounter one of them during the Enterprise's 5 year mission. It would also explain why the Gorn were initially so hostile to humans - the first ones they met were augments who fought back and tore up their nursery instead of being the docile prey they expected. Captain Pike says he read her file, which would be highly classified if she were an augment, including the part about being captured by the Gorn.

In TNG most of the memorable episodes were about the definition of human, which wasn't social commentary, but still an interesting moral and ethical exploration.  Still, it has the Ferengi in the first season, and they're a clear commentary on the materialism of the 80s.  Klingon's are changed to mirror the complicated US/Russia relationship in the 90s.  The terrorism episode (High Ground) had trouble getting broadcasted in Ireland.  (And it starts the Bajor / Cardassia thing which definitely resonates with Northern Ireland).  It tries and fails to address Native Rights (that one sucks).  

DS9 is the high point of social commentary.  There's a noticeable motif of grappling with Imperialism, even the [cheerful cultural Imperialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ) of the Federation.  There's a wonderful implicit comparison between the Federation's beneficent Imperialism, the naked desire for control of the Dominion, and the purely extractive and evil Imperialism of the Cardassians.  The entire series has characters grappling with alien beliefs that challenge their own.  Even the Prime Directive episodes in TNG and DS9 are really reflections on Colonialism.  

Beyond Colonialism DS9 has an enormous theme of the relationship of religion and politics (which it does well until the last season).  Then there's more Bell Riots, euthanasia (disease episode), gay rights / gender identity (Reunion), Unionization (Bar Association), Immigration (Sanctuary), eminent domain (Progress), etc.  These are deeply personal stories too.  Keiko embodies the conflict working women face; she gives up her job for her family and takes a traditionally female job as a teacher, but it makes her unhappy.

Voyager steps back from this.  It can't exactly engage in much Imperialism being disconnected from the Federation.  It does WMDs/nuclear weapons at least four times; Silicon Valley (Future's End);  Date Rape (Blood Fever); and pollution (the Malon).  Almost all of these are a bit tame in comparison to DS9.  Saying nuclear weapons are bad after the Cold War isn't exactly timely.  Blood Fever more shows a change in norms rather than addressing the issue.  The Malon were Captain Planet villains; few actual humans are pro-pollution.  The only bit of social commentary (I remember) that was pretty cutting was Critical Care, which is deeply critical of our for-profit medical system.

Enterprise's social commentary was... pathetic.  Their treatment of gender is regressive.  Fusion, is the first episode of any show ever to show that rape is bad.  Two Days, where horny men are punished by gender changing thieves.  Cogenitor, where an inappropriately gendered relationship ends in tragedy.  (Also, all the weird ass goo rubbing scenes.)  The AIDS episode (Stigma) was cowardly; the stigma about AIDS wasn't exactly common by 2000.  Then there's a Sept. 11 attack, and the best way to deal with it is by Archer compromising his principles.  

Picard... well, it tried.  But not too hard.

Is Discovery better in this regard?",startrek,Does Discovery do any good social commentary?

1652037146,"Like a lot of this sub, the first two episodes of Picard S2 had me extremely excited. A cool new setting and faction with the Confederation (which almost immediately manages to be more intereseting than the Terran Empire), references to Sisko, Dukat, and Martok to please DS9 fans like me, Rios as captain of the Stargazer and Picard acting like classic Picard. 

The rest of the season has just felt like watching a slow-motion trainwreck, though. I kept hoping that the time travel plot would be resolved in a few episodes so we could get back to the interesting stuff, i.e. the Confederation and the 2401 timeline, but god if they didn't find every possible way to drag this out. The back and forth seduction/corruption dynamic between Jurati and the Borg Queen got old pretty quickly for me, as did Seven and Raffi's 'will they-won't they' relationship and Rios' very obviously telegraphed infatuation with the nurse. You are a Starfleet captain, man, you don't get a pass for egregiously violating the temporal prime directive because you've got a crush on a woman you've known for two days. And aside from some tiny easter eggs, it feels like the show has been actively avoiding focusing on the more unique-to-Trek elements of a 2024 setting, like the Sanctuary Districts and the fact that the Eugenics Wars are a thing that happened.

There are a few interesting things thrown into the mix, like Q's mysterious condition, Guinan, and the one FBI agent who met some Vulcans as a kid, but there's just so much pointless melodrama and bad writing to slog through to get to the good stuff. The Picard childhood trauma plot feels way too drawn out- it could've easily been wrapped up in one episode, but the same could be said for a lot of plot points this season. I'm currently about a third of the way through episode nine, watching Picard have another childhood flashback in the middle of a firefight, and I've just hit a wall- the show has lost me, and I have no remaining motivation to finish the season. 

I apologize for not being more positive, but it's just been crushing to be so excited by S2 at first, and then to have those hopes slowly crushed over two months. And watching the amazing SNW premier just a few days ago really highlighted my problems with Picard and this drawn out serialized story even more clearly. I've read articles where the showrunners promise that S3 will return to spaceships and the futuristic setting, but the very tone of these comments seems to indicate they knew in advance that the season-long trip to 2024 wouldn't be popular, which makes this whole thing even more bewildering to me. 

In summary, apologies for the long rant, but is it worth pushing through the end of Picard S2, or am I better off just watching SNW and waiting for S3 of Lower Decks?",startrek,"Picard is my favorite captain, but I can't muster the will to finish Picard S2. Is it worth pushing through?"

1652024132,"Just for fun, here is my take on the best possible ship the Federation could build (circa 2380's) using Canon technology.

Body style and size: Galaxy Class

Hull: Reinforced tritanium with nano tech, self replicating ablative armor (Voyager: Endgame)

Engines:  Transwarp drive, max speed warp 9.9997.

Shields: Self replicating primary, secondary, and tertiary forward and aft shield generators, available through main, back up, or 3rd redundant power systems (DS9 - O'Brien comments that a 3rd redundant back up is best, since the first 2 could fail).

-Further apply Barkley's shield mods from the Nth Degree for a 300% increase in shield power, set on a modulating frequency that changes every 0.1 seconds.

Weapons: 12 bank Type 8 phaser array (Sovereign class), 4 bank phaser cannon array (Defiant class), quantum torpedoes, transphasic torpedoes, gravimetric torpedoes, Type 5 long range tactical unit Antimatter torpedoes (VOY: warhead), and Chroniton torpedoes (Krennim time ship)

Other external defenses: Time phasing (Krennim ship), temporal displacement wave (Borg sphere), tractor beams, deflector array

Internal defenses:  Holographic emitters in every room, designed to deploy emergency medical holograms (Vogager) and emergency Combat Holograms (Picard) in the design of species 8472, set at maximum difficulty.

- Transwarp beaming capability.

Crew compliment:  Captain - Picard
First officer - Kira
Second officer - Data
Chief tactical officer - Odo
Chief Engineer - Miles Edward O' f-ing Brien.
Cheif of Medicine - Bashir
Chief science officer - Seven if Nine
Ship's counselor- Professor Moriarty

So we have a ship that exists outside of normal space time, which can then time travel at will, impervious to all conventional means of attack.

If somehow forced back into normal space time, Shields would be difficult for any weapon to penetrate, and even entire empires would be threatened by the type 5 antimatter or transphasic torpedoes.

Any boarding party would be ripped apart by tripedal psychic apex predators, while all starfleet personnel would be surrounded by doctors and shields.  If somehow they break through the lines, the crew could transwarp beam to anywhere in the galaxy to escape, then set a chroniton torpedo to self destruct and wipe out the threat from existence.

What did I miss?  Any ideas on a ship or attack strategy that could overcome all this?  Or just cool ideas for new ships using  available technology?",startrek,The Ultimate Starship made entirely from Canon technology.

One example would be haw everyone ignores the chain of command when talking to eachother. 

Other things I wouldn't have even realized. How the plot is ""Start Trek"" to the absolute extreme. If you fed an AI with all the ST content there is and told it to write the most cliche ST plot it would propably write something similar. 

Even things I wouldn't have minded at all fill me with dread because I don't trust the writer anymore. Una Chin-Rileys backstory is somewhat reminiscent Tasha Yars backstory. After PIC and DISC I just don't want to watch Stafleet Officers with untreated trauma which clearly impeeds their decision making any more.

1652009129,"I watched Strange New World season 1 ep 1 and thought it had a lot of potential but wish there was a little more meat to it. 

The concept is great, I love the idea of a pre-warp civilization that saw a major event happening and was able to pick up on some of the tech, and I like the idea of how it was used in a civilization that hadn't moved past conflict, but I falt we didn't get to explore more of that conflict. 

I just feel like it was very rushed, we spend so much time rehashing the same vague scene with pike that it feels like we don't we really do anything else(hyperbole of course but you get the point), I think the whole thing felt very weird pacing wise, slow in the beginning and fast at the end but I feel the ending is a great example of that. 

This could have been a great scene if we were a little more involved with civil war aspect, we're told that there is a centuries old civil war raging and  the leaders are desperate and willing to use extreme measures to end it, but that's exactly it we're only ever told that we never see it so it feels kind of hollow. 

Honestly if I were to do one thing to fix it I would spit it into 2 parts. It felt like they were trying to give us a long drawn out episode at the beginning but then ran out of episode and had to push everything at the end so I would split the episode into 2 parts to give them more time to work with, then I would spend the first one on the rescue of #1 and exploration of the civil war, motivations, how it effects the people, we see military schools at the end maybe explore that and how this war has effected the people and caused them to suffer, then at the end of the episode rescue #1 and have it take a bit longer it felt to easy in the episode, like they just kinda walked in and took her. 

For part 2 I would focus on ending the war, have Capt Pike look for ways to end the war without exposing them and then spend the episode looking at the rebel side and have Pike convince the 2 leaders to negotiate on enterprise and show them the destruction and have that move them to work for peace before sending them back to enact change and work for peace on their own.

I felt nothing.

I have watched some of Discovery and found it boring - the only character I found mildly engaging was Pike which gives me hope for SNW. I have just finished watching the second season of Picard, and as I reflect back on the series I just feel empty. It's not just that the writing was bad or that the characters lacked any sort of meaningful depth, or even that the creators seem to have picked up an obsession with trying to emotionally manipulate the audience instead of just letting the story breathe. It just all seems so hollow, and I can't really explain why.

How is it that a show which is obsessed with emotions has left me feeling divorced from mine?

When I think about what I enjoy about a TV show one of the primary reasons for wanting to go back and rewatch it in the future is because I enjoy spending time with the characters. The truth is I love to watch Riker and the others play poker, or sit with Bashir in Vic's bar or even hang out in the mess hall on Voyager with the smell if Neelix's cooking. And it's not just nostalgia colouring my perception either. There have been plenty of TV series that I have watched since childhood where I an happy to put them back on and enjoy my time with the characters.

I don't feel like I know any of the characters in Picard, and I guess that's why I am very unlikely to go back and rewatch the series.

And that's sad.

It's sad because I live Star Trek and Jean-Luc Picard was a huge role model for me growing up and this new series feels like a betrayal.

1651970958,""" The one you call Number One has the superior mind and will produce highly intelligent offspring. Although she seems to lack emotions, this is largely a pretense."" 

Ever since I've become a Trekkie, I've been obsessed with one episode of TOS: the Cage. I mainly watched that episode over and over again for Number one. The fact that she was the proto-Spock, in terms of being the highly logical and stoic member of the crew, was fascinating to me, yet at the same time frustrating that this potentially rich character never got the chance to be explored. I wanted more of this woman with the steel trap mind who likes to play it emotionless on the bridge. I consumed a lot of beta canon just to get more of her including Vulcan's Glory.

So I was ecstatic when I learned that Discovery would finally feature Number One. Needless to say I was disappointed, she only made brief appearances and I didn't get the cerebral, capable first officer had been yearning for all these years--aside from that moment she had enough foresight to outfit the shuttles with the latest weaponry. 

I think my biggest gripe with her is that she feels like the bog standard first officer and not this uniquely interesting character that the Star Trek Bible promised. For me, I thought the question of why she seemed to lack emotion  a fascinating question. I was hoping for a Spock and Saavik mentor- protege with her and Spock given how similar they are-- We did get that somewhat in Q&amp;A. Maybe it's a matter of reality not matching expectations.

The entire first season was, for the most part, dedicated to her and her story. Season 2 she became a complete afterthought. But the tease her joining Wesley and potentially being associated with that anomaly‚Ä¶or other potential stories.

Now she is done? What was the point of that damn scene with Wesley then?

I personally felt she was the highlight of season 1 and had so much potential wasted in season 2. Now the three best new characters introduced in series (Soji, Rios, and Jurati/Borgat) are not returning for season 3.

1651954280,"I don't know if they still do this these days, but back in my day, a popular topic for radio stations and music-oriented publications was *Desert Island Discs*: a musician is asked to compile a list of records they would bring with them to a desert island, as if they were the only records they would ever be able to listen to again.

Let's do that for Star Trek episodes. Pick one episode for each series that you would take to a desert island. These may not be your favorite episodes, but they should be episodes you could pick up and watch at any time under any circumstances, over and over again. Two-hour episodes and two-part episodes count as one.

I'm confining myself to live action series only, just because it's easier that way; don't feel restricted by my choice. My list:

**TOS**: *The Menagerie*

This was the first episode of *Star Trek* I ever saw (I had seen TWOK in the theater a few months earlier) and I still remember how raptly I watched this story of two captains, so different yet so similar, as they dealt with some surprisingly advanced ethical questions. As SNW brings us back to the tale of Captain Christopher Pike, this is an episode all fans owe it to themselves to watch. If I live to by a hundred, *The Menagerie* will always be my jam. 

**TNG**: *The Best of Both Worlds*

This is kind of a default choice, I admit. I could so easily pick *Yesterday's Enterprise*, *The Offspring*, *Tapestry*, or *Parallels*, but nothing brings back my youth like *BoBW* and the exquisite, excruciating summer of 1990. If you weren't there, you don't know.

**DS9**: *Far Beyond the Stars*

A lot of choices here too. My choice of *Far Beyond the Stars* over such gems as *Duet* and *Trials and Tribble-ations* is due in part to my love for mid-century Americana as well as the deeply felt meaning that Avery Brooks and the rest of the cast imbued it with. I will never get tired of watching this episode.

**VOY**: *Worst Case Scenario*

This. This is the perfectly self-contained *Voyager* episode. Every action taken by everyone makes total sense based on everything that had come before, and it all added up to one of the most entertaining romps Trek has ever given us. I could watch this episode every day for months.

**ENT**: *In a Mirror, Darkly*

If scenery chewing were an Olympic event, the *Enterprise* cast would have swept all the medals for this one. I'm so happy that I get to put a Mirror Universe episode on my list, and even happier that it's this one.

**DIS**: *Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad*

Don't have much to say about this one, other than it's a Harry Mudd episode and that we get to watch Captain Lorca get killed over and over again.

**PIC**: *Nepenthe*

A big part of me wants to pick *Stardust City Rag*, just because Freecloud is so much fun. At the end of the day, though, I just can't resist watching Picard circle back around to Will Riker and Deanna Troi and their adorable kid.

**SNW**: *Strange New Worlds*

I choose this because it's the only episode we've seen! If it's any indication, though, this is the series I've been waiting for, and I can't wait for more.",startrek,Desert Island Episodes

1651945489,"There was some discussion about this on this reddit a few weeks ago, but a line Guinan had in the finale made things even more complicated. When Picard meets Guinan in 2024, she has no idea who he is, even though she met him previously in the 1890's (TNG Time's Arrow). The best theories I heard that explained this said that she didn't remember this because the future where Picard went back to the 1890's didn't exist, because until they completed their mission in 2024, the Confederation Timeline was the future.  
However, in the finale Guinan stated that she remembered meeting Picard in 2024 *before* he went back in time to 2024, and just didn't mention it to avoid changing the timeline. This raises the question, how did she remember changes to the timeline before they were made? If they were always part of the timeline and Picard and crew were always destined to go back in time to assure the Europa launch, then shouldn't Guinan have remembered meeting Picard in the 1890's in 2024? Or did Guinan in Picard s2e01 not remember this, but after Picard returned her memories changed to make her think she did?

Does this mean that Picard's rejection of the queen in both BOBW and First Contact delayed peace with the Borg?",startrek,"Does Jurati prove that Picard and/or Data could have ""rescued"" the Borg by being the Queen's Friend (like she wanted)?"
1651944224,"The kinder, gentler Borg is not a paradox, and the queen accepting Jurati's offer made sense. 

First, I've seen lots of comments saying the events of Picard season 2 should have resulted in wiping out all of the events involving confrontation with the Borg and drastically altering Federation history and making it to where none of what happened in Picard happened.   


That assumes that Borgati took control of the Borg collective we'd already encountered. I don't think she did. What makes sense is that she started a new ""Collective of the willing"" in an area of space the known Borg didn't control, and not explored by the Federation up through the 24th century.   


So the original Borg are still out there, with their own queen. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, why did the queen accept Jurati's offer? Because Jurati had won, and accepting the offer was the only way to live to fight another day. It was a stalemate between Jurati and the Queen, but Jurati keeping the queen paralyzed and unable to harm the crew meant that she was vulnerable, and there was a good chance Raffi would kill her when Seven died. Accepting the offer kept her alive. She may well have been thinking that she would be able to subdue the Jurati personality at a later time, but failed to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why did Borgati go through the theatrics of transporting to the Stargazer with her face covered, play a song that only had meaning to Picard and then forcefully seize control of the fleet? Because she understood causality had to be fulfilled for the events to play out in the way they did, so her collective could be created and arrive at that point in space and time to use the fleet to stop the emerging transwarp conduit from destroying multiple star systems. Another approach might have resulted in a different outcome.

All in all it was very good! There area few things I didn't love,a bit too callback/Easter egg heavy a la Disney, but that can be overlooked, and they still used music a bit more often than I would like.

1651922941,"So, Picard Season 2 has come to an end. The crew gathers one last time as a dying Q prepares to snap them home. But one of them isn't going.

""I'm staying."" Rios says.

No one begrudges him his decision, After all, he's found the family and the love of his life here that he never found in his own time. And with the *La Sirena* having flown off with the Borg Queen, there's really nothing left for him in the 25th century. He was just living by himself with five hgolographic versions of him on an empty cargo ship, right? So, with no remaining baggage, he opts to remain in the past where he is happy. And Patrick Stewart wishes him well, and tells him to 'Make a good future.'

I say 'Patrick Stewart', because Jean Luc Picard... the Jean Luc Picard I grew up with anyway... sure as hell would *not.*

Because Rios is *not* baggage free, is he?

He's *not* the captain of the little freight shuttle *La Sirena* anymore, with a crew of he, himself, and him.

He is the Captain of the Federation Starship *U.S.S. Stargazer,* a ship with a crew of *hundreds* of Starfleet personnel, some of them fresh out of the Academy. A ship and crew that Rios swore an oath to be responsible for as Captain. A ship that he left *in crisis.*

For instance, the fact that as of the moment they were yoinked into an alternate timeline, the ship's self-destruct had been activated? One which only he and Picard would have the authority to override (Possibly the First Officer, but I believe them and most of the bridge crew are, at that point, stunned and unconscious).

Now... remove the time travel angle. If they had just beamed down to an alien world, spent 72 hours there, and Rios had gotten close to one of the inhabitants and decided not to go back... would that fly?

No, of course not. He has made an oath. He has responsibilities. He has people who are depending on him, and his ship is in trouble. It needs its Captain.

Now, perhaps Rios has a good reason? Like perhaps he knew that he had to stay behind in order to give the Doctor and her son the support necessary to back the operation to clean up Earth's oceans?

No... no, we only find that out from Guinan once back home. Nobody knew about that going into this.

Well, maybe he's been moved by the plight of the people in this time, the injustices and struggle, and feels he could make a difference here that he never could as a Starfleet Captain?

No... Rios seemed kinda casual about the whole thing. He seemed more excited about the non replicated food, to be honest.

Well, perhaps he had spent an extended period of time with his new love and her son, and formed real familial bonds, having years pass where it had only been hours for the others and thus showing that there was a deep and solid connection...

Nope, nope... He's only known her for 72 hours. Actually, he's spent considerably less than that with her. In fact, most of that time he spent on a continual adrenaline high as they struggled to try and prevent their timeline from coming apart. I don't think he actually spent any time with her and her son at all that wasn't in some level of crisis mode. I would be surprised if he could tell you her last name without the name tag on her doctor's coat to clue him in.

So... yeah. Rios meets a girl, knows her somewhat *less* well that an average weekend fling for him, decides she's the one he wants to spend forever with, and abandons his ship and command, knowing full well the ship is on the brink of destruction. Oh, and all of this is in clear and direct violation of the Temporal Prime Directive.

I don't *think* the Federation does firing squads for desertion anymore, but I suspect this would cause them to reconsider.

It's such a mind boggling selfish, shallow, unhealthy and even *treacherous* thing for him to do. He's betraying everyone on that ship that were relying on him to get them home, or at least ensure their deaths have some meaning.

If he were to stand before them and explain his decision to them, how do you think they would feel?

If the writers were planning on having him stay in the past (Which was plainly obvious from the moment the Doctor was introduced) the *why* make him the Captain of the *Stargazer!?* Why not just leave him in command of the *La Sirena?* *Star Trek* has always made the center seat of a Starship a big deal, a heavy responsibility, one that is neither handed out willy-nilly, taken up lightly, nor set down easily. It is probably the most important job in the Federation, or at least is portrayed as such. And Rios just tossed it like a used cigar butt.

Captain Kirk went back in time and fell in love. And to protect the timeline and to fulfil his duty *and to ensure he had a ship and a Federation to return to,* he had to watch her die when he could have saved her, or even just allowed her to be saved. Rios went back in time and fell in love, decided to say 'screw it, it's probably destiny anyway' to the timeline, and didn't even bother to check if his ship was going to be okay without him. He didn't even remember to remind Picard to save the *Stargazer* and his crew.

Pike and crew avoided jail for breaking General Order One because the incident with Discovery couldn't be acknowledged. But if the incident couldn't be acknowledged, then on paper the Federation hadn't accidentally influenced planet Kiley, and they had therefore spontaneously produced the warp bomb. How can Starfleet command defend Pike et al when they can't explain their actions?

Three seems like a very small crew for a ship the size of the Archer, but I'll accept it for the following reasons: the ship was designed separately to the script writing process, so it looks too big, and also in First Contact, there was a very small number of Vulcans. I also get that from a narrative viewpoint, it makes for a better story when there's a small number. They're easier to capture, so a rescue mission has to be launched etc. But what I don't get is why that would be done from Starfleet's perspective. More specifically, why would they leave a completely empty ship in space. That seems like that would be against protocol except in emergency situations.

Pike's reveal of his ticking clock. I'm a little disappointed that this was revealed to everybody so easily.

1651885438,"I'm reading through a lot of YouTube comments regarding the current season of Picard and I am seeing so much negativity that seems to be politically charged. 

Yesterday, I made a post asking if Star Trek was considered to be more liberal. Some of you saw it before it was deleted, and instead of engaging thoughtfully, many of you were mean spirited and asked me how I could have seriously asked that. 

Many argued it was more liberal, while taking a sort of written tone that suggested I was an idiot for asking. Others argued it was more colonial and imperialist. 

Well, here is what I think and why I asked a question I already knew the answer to.

It seems the current political climate has colored the view with which many people see things they used to love. Sure, maybe some people still like the old trek because of nostalgia, but so many seem to have forgotten what it always stood for-

Striving for something greater. Discovery. Hope. Equality. Recognizing the rights of those we agree with and disagree with. Hell, they even had moral qualms about destroying the entire Borg collective because they were *better than that*. 

So no, I'm not an idiot. And yes, I do know Star Trek is more liberal in it's ideologies. 

But for those of you who hate Star Trek because you think it became too political or became what you call ""woke,"" well you are objectively wrong. It always has been this way. 

Star Trek didn't change. You changed.",startrek,"Star Trek hasn't become ""woke."" It was always ""woke."""

1651873459,"I find the time travel plot of PIC S2 to be pretty convoluted, so I wrote down the important events that happen to try to make sense of it, now that we know the entire story. Please let me know of any errors.

* The benevolent Borg Queen Agnes Jurati attempts to stop some temporal radiation, but requires more ships. She hails the Federation for Picard, knowing from first-hand experience that he would recognize her, and is also predestined to come.

* After Picard arrives, Queen Agnes forcibly enters the bridge, takes control of the ship and attacks the crew. Why she does this instead of revealing herself isn't clear, but potentially explained by the fact that she knows this does not matter, as Q will intervene in the last moment to give Picard, Seven, and Raffi the memories of what happened to her.

* Q is dying for an unexplained reason, but does not feel the meaning he expected while dying. As Picard is his ""favorite,"" Q thus endeavors to make Picard feel open to love and accept his mother's suicide from his childhood. Despite this, Q angrily tells Picard this is not a ""lesson,"" but a ""penance,"" and leaves out the specifics of what's happening. Q's plan is to alter time in 2024 by preventing Picard's ancestor from being the first human to discover alien life, with the idea that Picard will time-travel to stop Q, and thus remember that his mother killed herself because he will park the ship by his childhood home.

* Q thus transports Picard (as well as Jurati, Rios, Seven, Raffi, and Elnor for some reason) to an alternate timeline where the Federation is replaced by a fascist human empire. The cast find the Borg Queen, who is revealed to have awareness of timeline changes (like Guinan). The Borg Queen calculates that the timeline diverged in 2024, during which Picard's ancestor is now no longer the first human to discover alien life (an event that none of the cast were ever aware of, for an unexplained reason). Why exactly this results in this specific diversion goes unexplained, but it has something to do with making an evil scientist's  obsolete.

* The cast (with the Borg Queen) use a space ship to travel back in time to 2024. The setting they are in is simultaneously: the malleable alternate past which can be drastically changed by the smallest action (hence Guinan not remembering Picard from a TNG episode, the cast's cautious actions in light of the ""Butterfly Effect,"" and the hypothesis that Picard could have chosen to destroy the skeleton key that he used to inadvertently assist in his mother's suicide), and also the predetermined and unchangeable past of the main timeline (hence Picard remembering the bullet holes they created in his childhood home, Queen Agnes existing for 400 years before the cast traveled back in time, Rios' 21st century life being meant to be, and Guinan always remembering the events of her younger self).

* The cast park the ship at Picard's childhood home. Elnor unfortunately dies, and the rest try to learn more about the temporal divergence from the Borg Queen. As they don't know about Picard's ancestor yet, their only lead is a ""Watcher"" that watches over Picard's ancestor. In an attempt to learn more about this ""Watcher,"" Jurati goes inside the Borg Queen's mind, resulting in the Borg Queen being able to later assimilate Jurati. They eventually get an address for the ""Watcher"" from the Borg Queen, but it turns out to be for the same bar of Picard's long-time friend Guinan that he already knew about.

* Despite this unexplained diversion, Guinan takes Picard to the Watcher, a Romulan named Tallinn who is tasked with protecting Picard's ancestor from the shadows. Picard remarks that Tallinn is completely identical to his flirty housekeeper, which ends up basically unexplained. The two team up, given their mutual goals.

* Around the same time as this, Q attempts to alter reality concerning Picard's ancestor. Assumedly, this has something to do with stopping or hindering her space mission. He supposedly does this knowing that Picard will somehow undo this, and end up in his childhood home so he can explore his trauma. But what Q is trying to do ends up unexplained, as his slow death suddenly deprives him of certain powers. Q thus has to engage in mundane manipulation to stop the space mission.

* Picard and Tallinn notice that Picard's ancestor's therapist is Q, and that he is trying to stop the space mission. It is unclear how long Q has been posing as her therapist. The cast finds out their last opportunity to convince her to go on the space mission is a gala happening right before pre-launch quarantine. After this, no one will be able to reach her.

* While all of this was happening, Rios was transported 30 feet into the air and was thus injured. He ends up at a clinic for undocumented immigrants. After becoming friendly with the head doctor and her son, the clinic is raided by ICE. Instead of escaping, Rios defends the doctor and her son, and ends up being detained by ICE. Rios is brutalized by cruel ICE officers, and put on a bus to be deported with other immigrants.

* Seven and Raffi learn about Rios' situation, and endeavor to save him. While aware of and occasionally mentioning the ""time travel rules,"" Seven and Raffi nonetheless break into an LAPD car, go on a high-speed chase, and eventually transport out. They find the transport bus, but cannot transport Rios in front of others without altering the timeline. They thus use an EMP to stop the bus, knock out the ICE officers, and free all the detainees. Rios remarks that he really likes the 21st century, because of Cuban cigars, real matches, and the doctor he met. He decides to stay in the 21st century after this is over because he likes it and feels he fits in.

* Also while this is happening, Q also recruits the evil  scientist to help him, an ancestor of Data's creator Noonian Soong. Q initially bribes him with a cure for a genetic disease for his cloned daughter, who looks identical to Maddox's Data-based androids from Season 1, thus suggesting that Noonian Soong based Data partially on his evil  ancestor's clone attempts (or on whomever she was cloned from). Q later just bribes the scientist with the promise that altering the timeline will result in great power for him.

* The whole cast goes to the gala to convince Picard's ancestor to go on the space mission. Their plan is somewhat of a success, though Jurati gives more bodily control to the Borg Queen in order to save the rest of the cast. Picard successfully convinces his ancestor, although the Borg Queen in Jurati's body escapes. Then she joins forces with the evil scientist in order to assimilate the galaxy, and goes to a bar to listen to Patrick's 43 year-old wife sing.

* The cast fight Jurati, the scientist, and his soldiers in a battle over the space ship. The soldiers are killed, the cast let the evil scientist go, Picard remembers his mother's suicide, and Jurati tells the Queen that the Borg will lose in every timeline unless they form a new Collective that embraces individuality. This persuades the Borg Queen to unite as the benevolent Borg Queen Agnes. She takes the space ship and waits for Picard back in the 25th century.

* On the day of the space mission, the evil scientist breaks the astronauts' quarantine by telling them that he deserves it for donating. He attempts to kill Picard's ancestor, but Tallinn disguises herself as her and dies instead. The space mission thus happens successfully. Rios fixes every alteration to the timeline he ""could find,"" which is made up of a small bag of 25th century technology.

* The scientist's clone-daughter realizes she's a clone, Q gives her a cure to her disease, and she walks around LA until Wesley Crusher approaches her and asks her if she wants to become a Traveler.

* Q tells Picard that he planned for all of this to happen in order to get Picard to accept his mother's death and open himself to love. They hug, and Q sends the cast back, except Rios, with the doctor and her son. Picard, Seven, and Raffi return to the 25th century, learning that Elnor somehow came back to life. They work with Borg Queen Agnes to stop the temporal radiation. Guinan tells Picard that his ancestor was the first to discover alien life, and she along with the doctor's son used the alien life to solve  (information that no one but Guinan knew for some reason).",startrek,A condensed summary of the convoluted time travel plot of Picard Season 2

Can you help me identify it so I can re-watch it and finally settle this unsettling memory - without having to rewatch all of TNG and TOS. Here's what I remember:

    some crew members [max a handful] are on a surface mission. they find an installation [might be an outpost or something alike] and decide to investigate (surprise). They are walking around on the outside and find a part of the complex, that looks like a rather wide silo. For some reason I can't remember they climb into a duct that leads to the inside. They lose grip and slide into the silo. They are stuck and can't get out. Since the silo has some property that blocks comms they can not take the easy way out.

How impressive was young Uhura as well!

My very favorite thing about the new show is Captain Pike.  Well written, well acted, noble, and flawed.  Seeing Pike come to grips with his impending disability struck very close to home for me and I imagine does for a lot of disabled Trek fans.  

Five years ago I became disabled and lost my ability to walk for any moderate distance on my own.  My lungs partially collapsed and my spine broke in three places.  But I survived.  These days instead of blazing a trail as trial lawyer I‚Äôm chair bound in medical exile at home with my three year old.  I had joked with my super DS9 fan wife that she had ended up married to Captain Pike with his wheelchair.

Seeing Pike wrestle with the knowledge that he is fated to become disabled somehow lends me strength in my own situation.  His struggle to turn his knowledge into strength and be a better captain because of it is inspiring to me.  The fear that he grapples with about what he will become is also very familiar to me.  

I wish he would stop saying that he is fated to ‚Äòdie‚Äô.  He corrects a few times.  But being disabled isn‚Äôt death.  It‚Äôs a change of circumstance.  You grow weaker in some ways.  But you also grow stronger in others you may not have anticipated.  It‚Äôs a truth you don‚Äôt really realize until you get there.

Similar to how it was used in Enterprise.

The usage of Man in this context is technically gender neutral and unlike ""no one,  references mankind instead of ""insert alien race"".  For stories set mid 23rd century and prior, it helps to further differentiate Starfleet from its later self.

Then they took him away before even giving us enough time to see his captaincy. Then they make the Borg, one of the Federation‚Äôs most feared and unnegotiable enemies allies?

Maybe Guinan was on Earth when the Borg attacked her home  planet and only traveled away from Earth to help surviving refugees  after she learned about the destruction of her homeworld. Guinan might not have known it was the Borg until she talked to other El-Aurians?

I know there's been some rational in the books as to this disparity suggesting Wesley's appearance, it either seemed too mental (turning up naked expecting a Betazoid traditional ceremony) or too regressive for Wesley's character development.

u/Wil approval of God needed, but could we be cool with the possibility that Wesley simply took a break to observe the physical world (reactivating his commission) for a stretch, much in the same way The Traveller did before him when he worked as Kadzinski's assistant?

In my opinion, PIC season 2‚Äôs weakest point was pacing. Really, the entirety of season 2 feels like we could have gotten to the finale in 5 or 6 episodes. That‚Äôs serialized contents hardest point to get right and it can make or break a season. Move too quick and fans are left asking how the how did we get here.

2. She's skittish around people reading her file (about the incident).

Therefore, I have concluded that it's possible that La'an:

1) Killed her family as an act of mercy, being turned into a breeding sac sounds...unpleasant. Unaware of the Gorn tradition of returning the survivor to space

2) Killed her family after becoming aware of the tradition. 

and lastly, which is a bit out there,

3) Killed her family, as a ""survival of the fittest"" test as part of a group of last descendants of Khan group. This is only here because of the unconfirmed report, and it sounds on brand for Augments.",startrek,(SNW THEORY) La'an is lying about her backstory.

The plot felt tired and re-hashed, and after season one I was hoping for more former TNG cast members to make an appearance.

And for a sad stab at nostalgia, not having any other former cast members except Brent Spiner and John de Lancie, frankly I felt ripped off. Don't get me wrong, I love Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine, who got even better, more rich and textured, great character development, but I kept hoping to see LeVar Burton or Colm Meaney or anyone really, for a show arc that literally and figuratively went to the past it would have been very nice to see old faces along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. When I grew up with TNG, I was young. Between about 8 and 12 years old catching reruns with my brother and cousin (both teenagers.) As such, I never got onto the whole ""annoying Wesley Crusher"" band wagon that seemed to permeate those who watched it and even on my re-watch a few years ago I never felt like he was annoying or a terrible part of the show. He was a point of view character for me growing up that nobody else could provide and I was sad to see him leave the show. Having him return as the explanation not only of what he's been up to but the ""where do the watchers come from?"" questions I had was perfect. I'm so glad Wil got to be on the show again, especially after not seeing him announced for season three. Also Kore was a character I wanted to see a resolution for and having her join the travelers was perfect.
2. I'll admit it, I teared up at Q and Picard's final scenes. I always knew the Q liked Picard and showed it off like a standard elementary school kid would a crush, but hearing him say it and letting Picard let go of his frustration and help out a frenemy (at worst. At best a friend) was beautiful. A great send off for the character and something that still brings a small tear to the eye when I think about it.
3. A perfect setup for the next Picard season, or even a new show in the new timeline (Stargazer with 7 as captain exploring the other side of the conduit please!) While it was the most rushed part of the finale in my opinion it is clearly meant as our teaser for future events which I cannot wait to explore. Is this the AI that was called last season? Who knows! I just know I'm stoked to see what happens next.
4. Its honestly been refreshing to see Picard so vulnerable and open this season. I'm glad his character was able to move beyond his stoicism and finally let some people into his life that he cares about.
5. Elnor's back! That's all. Just happy about it and I hope he gets more to do next season.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly that's it. No complaints, no questions, no asking for extra comments. I really just felt the need to put some words down about it and share my love for the finale and this franchise as a whole. It's not always perfect, but it always brings a smile to my face.

‚ÄúSomeone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives.

1651713587,"So I realize this is likely to be an unpopular opinion, but I feel like the recent episode of Picard, where Jurati talks to the Borg Queen about changing her ways, solved the issues I've always had with the Borg.

The Borg, despite claiming to want to take in the biological and technological uniqueness of the species they assimilated never really seemed to do that. Outside of one or two off hand comments about the Hirgoen or Hazari making good tactical drones, all we see of the Borg is that every species, regardless of their abilities, become a copy paste drone that ignores any sort of specialized role said species could fulfill to make the Borg actually stronger.

This homogenization has also created the Borg's most glaring weakness, their lack of ability to actually adapt to situations as they encounter them. The Borg are notoriously unable to really adapt to any new situation beyond just sending more Cubes at the problem. This has allowed numerous species in the Delta Quadrant, where the Borg have been around for 1000+ years, avoid total assimilation, and has allowed the Federation to defeat them time and time again with clever tactics.

It also ignores basic about biology that a more diverse pool to draw from is inherently more useful for a specie's survival.

The methods that they use to go about this, i.e. forcible assimilation, has naturally caused large scale galactic resistance against the Borg, which has resulted in the deaths of untold numbers of drones, and cubes, and overall been a negative for the Borg's overall plans then had they gone about it any other way. It also would invariably lead to their own end, as this recent episode of Picard pointed out, and as Voyager showed with Species 8472, due to the Borg eventually riling so many people, or one powerful group of people, up enough to make a force that could stop them.

The idea that a quasi-machine race, that has assimilated members of over 10,000 species, would be so stupid as to fail such a basic biology lesson, and basic tactics lessons, has always been one of the sore points of Star Trek for me. Nothing they ever did ever made sense in regards to their stated goals, since everything they did directly ran against it. They were just belligerent for the sake of having a belligerent enemy, rather then because they needed to be, or should be the way that they were.

Jurati's talk with the Borg Queen in Episode 9, where she basically tells the Borg queen ""why don't you just not do what you have been doing, and actually embrace people's uniqueness"" was such a franchise aware moment IMO. Its like the writers knew ""yeah the Borg were dumb, lets tell them how they are being dumb and have them stop being dumb"".

1651679290,"I never liked gangster movies/stories, but ""A Piece of the Action"" was actually a lot of fun to watch.

I'm going through TOS to try to find episodes my kids will like, so I'm watching with a different perspective than usual, and I'm picking up things I didn't expect. This episode, specifically, has some great details, and I just wanted to share some thoughts.

* When the kid runs up the steps to create a distraction so Kirk and Spock can incapacitate the armed guards at the doors, one of those guards makes the funniest ""Oh, no, I'm passing out!"" face I've ever seen.
* Kirk himself doesn't know the rules of Fizzbin. He deals two Jacks to the guy, tells him that's a good thing, but getting a third Jack on the next deal is bad. Seconds later, he deals that dreaded third Jack, but he tells the guy it's a ""lucky"" and ""wonderful"" thing.
* The chances of drawing three Jacks in a row are very slim (worse than 1 in 2000, if my Google results are accurate).
* Kirk starts speaking in that gangster accent partway through the show. It gets stronger and more nasal with every scene. It's clear he's having fun with it.
* In some of the outside scenes, I kind of get the impression that the writers came up with this story while looking at existing sets in other parts of the studio lot and thinking up ideas for episodes that wouldn't require building new sets.

1651646134,"In the TNG episode ""The Measure of a Man"", Data's right to autonomy and status as a sentient (technically, sapient) being is called into question. A starfleet admiral holds a trial requiring the first and second officers of the Enterprise to act as counsel. Picard is assigned to defend Data which he gladly accepts. Riker is assigned to argue against Data's personhood, and he initially refuses, stating that he would never argue against Data's personhood, because he would not believe in what he's arguing, and that Data is his friend. The admiral pontificates that sometimes people will be in situations where they ""need"" to argue for a position they don't personally hold, and that if he refuses, she will summarily rule against Data.

This always bothered me but I couldn't put my finger on it the first time I watched the episode. Now, I realize that the issue lies in the concept of a conflict of interest. 

In real legal systems, a lawyer generally cannot have conflict of interest in the case they're arguing. If they truly don't believe in what they're arguing, or if they have a personal relationship with the person they're arguing against, those absolute would count as conflicts of interest. It wouldn't be fair to the person they're representing, and wouldn't result in a completely fair trial, which people should have the right to. Even if they genuinely make every effort to block out their personal thoughts on this case, it will still subconsciously affect their performance. In this case, yes, as Riker says in the episode, they'll have to find someone else do fill the position.

And what's with ruling summarily if Riker refuses? Imagine if that happened at a real life trial: ""Oh, your opponenr can't find a lawyer that will represent them? Guess they win!"" That shouldn't happen. What's stopping them from deferring the trial until they can find proper counsel? Why the rush? Actually, that was the excuse they used for forcing Picard and Riker, who aren't trained lawyers, to represent this trial in this first place, that the starbase they're at is brand new, and there isn't enough staff for a proper hearing. Then wait for more staff? If you want a fair trail, you can't rush through it? You need to wait until you're capable of holding a fair trial!

And even if you say ""oh Starfleet is a military organization, and military trials are different from civilian trials"". Except they're not currently at war, so they have no logistical reason to hold any sort of emergency tribunals, and also, rulings relating to human rights (or android rights) should absolutely not be made in a military court. It probably shouldn't even be made in a regular trial court, but by the supreme court.

All in all, even though this was still a very powerful episode due to what actually happened in the trial, the opening and premise didn't make much sense. A proper legal system shouldn't have operated like that, let alone a Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communist society. The trial should have waited until the proper staff can be acquired.

What do you think? Agree? Disagree? Why or why not? Other thoughts?

The egalitarian nature of it all, the moral exploration persists, but a believable code of conduct seems to have been lost.

The reason I ask is I believe in some interviews pre-S1, Stewart mentioned his condition to playing Picard again is to not be the captain of a starship again. Some reports also mentioned he was also very involved in the story writing early on. If so... could it be possible that Stewart might have directly influenced the direction Picard is (being far less sci-fi and Trekie than we liked) going and would become partially responsible for poor storywriting?

1651628684,"Just finished episode 9 of Picard. Jurati refers to the Borg queen having seven be one of her best, but this is not the same Borg queen and seven is not the same person she was in the original timeline. I guess you could argue that Jurati wasn't thinking of that, but it was written at such an important character speech that I'm sure it was writer error. 

After that, she convinces Borg queen to go and change the collective. Now correct me if I'm wrong but does that not completely alter the timeline, this negating this entire season's plot point to stop Q from changing everything? I can see how that helps but that would entirely ruin some parts of TNG and really a great part of the Star Trek universe.

Not only that but I'm gonna point out that all the things that people have listed as being wrong with this season cannot be explained as ""oh this is a different timeline"". That doesn't make sense; the timeline shift happens when the Europa mission was changed, that is the shifting point that caused the chain of events to create the confederation. Otherwise them doing anything within this entire travel back in time thing doesn't matter because the timeline will have already changed. 

Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed more this season than season 1, this was just a little rant I had in my head that's been bothering me.

I wanted to add my thoughts to the Captain April casting. Recently for my blog I have started reviewing the Animated Series which I haven‚Äôt seen since I was a kid. So far, my thoughts are both ‚Äúthese stories are awesome and amazing‚Äù and ‚Äúmy god this animation sucks.‚Äù You might compare the animation to the graphics in TOS but the difference is TOS graphics were excellent for their time, they even won a few awards. They only look cheap in comparison, whereas TAS animation was poor even for the time. 

However, the stories are compelling. So recently they cast Adrian Holmes as Captain Robert T. April, a character who was only appearance was in the last episode of TAS. So, Holmes is black and the animated April was white. Now this has upset two bases of people: racists and those fans of TAS who think it is being decanonized again. 

My argument is on TAS the tribbles were pink and not brown and none of the characters pointed this out. The delta on crew‚Äôs shirts on TAS has a hard time pointing up. They point right or left and sometimes appear on the wrong side. In short, my view is this: while I see TAS **stories** as cannon I don‚Äôt count any TAS **visuals** as canon.  So, I am looking forward to Mr. Holmes performance.",startrek,My Thoughts on the New April casting
1651628596,"So getting into Star Trek, I decide to go with the release order. Start with TOS, then TOS cast movies, then TNG up to season 5, then start going back and forth with DS9 season 1, TNG season 6, so on and so forth.

I've gone up to Star Trek 3, the Search for Spock, and things are feeling really weird. I'm not sure why, but it seems like I'm not on the same wavelength as the rest of the Star Trek fandom. The more I read from Star Trek fans, the more weird I feel. I've read a lot about how season 1 of TOS is the best one, with the subsequent seasons declining. But for me, season 2 was the best of TOS. Most of my fave episodes are from that season.

But now it's carrying on to the movies. I loved the first one, only to find out it's considered one of the worst Star Trek movies. Second one I enjoyed along with everyone else. But I've just finished Star Trek 3, and I disliked it quite heavily. The story just felt too silly and ridiculous with Spock's soul being transferred to McCoy, while his body is turned back into a boy, who then rapidly ages to become old Spock again, so they can cut and paste his soul back to old Spock. But according to reviews from Star Trek fans I've been reading, this movie is underrated and is the exception to the ""odd numbered original Star Trek movies are bad"" rule.

It's like I'm really out of sync with the Star Trek fandom consensus. And with the all the series coming back into the picture, I've heard from some fans about how much I'll hate the first 2 seasons of TNG, but love the rest of it, and DS9 is the best series etc. But the fact that I'm already not on the same page with Star Trek fandom what I've already seen makes me worried I won't feel the same as everyone else about all that.

The thing is I was a child in the late 80s and I practically grew up with TNG. As far as I am concerned TNG ""IS"" StarTrek. 

Compared to TNG, TOS just feels very dated, and not in a good way. The bridge looked plastic ( I actually liked the hotel like and cozy appearance of the enterprise-D), the effects were bad, the music forgettable (The main theme with the weird voice even sounds laughable to me).

The acting was bad, the costumes cringey , the Klingons looked like people with bronze makeup. And whats with all the sexist crap. Also, what with finding planets that are carbon copies of historical periods of Earth, never found those stories convincing.

1651608282,"I think it's great that Robert April is played by a black actor. But obviously the Elephant in the room is ""TAS is canon because XYZ"". Personally, given how far-fetched animated shows usually are (they are designed for kids or exist as comedy for other demographics) and the fact that none of the events of TAS have ever been mentioned in subsequent shows in the franchise (excluding LD, which is the same deal - animated), it's relatively easy to see what the intentions were from latter show runners and scriptwriters.

We've seen complete ignorance for TAS, including Star Trek V wherein the magical people at the centre of the Galaxy have disappeared and a barrier has appeared (this was subsequently ignored by The Nth Factor, wherein there was no barrier, but giant talking heads persisted) in place.

I can't post this in Daystrom because the ""canon"" thing. So I'll post it in here:

If we're adhering to canon, then the V'Ger cloud is larger than the solar system (at 82 AU's.) That was retconned by TMP director's edition. Nobody had any problem accepting a detail like this, because it made a lot more sense to the setting. 

The same applies for Robert April, who was a prototype Pike/Kirk that GR outlined when pitching the series. This is followed in his singular appearance in TAS, wherein he's a swap of Kirk's animation model. In other media, photographs of GR were used to represent April (completely non-canon.) By making April an original character that isn't a GR placeholder or a random palate swap of Kirk, they are doing something that makes sense for a featured (and most-probably) highly important guest role. Thus April could be any ethnicity, it just so happened that Adrian Holmes (the showrunner's choice) is a black man.

I think if people are truly pissed at the idea that TAS probably stretches ""canon"" a bit too much, they could remaster the visuals of TAS, and make April resemble Adrian Holmes. This probably would be a profitable venture if Paramount put up the cash to do it. But that doesn't change the fact that TAS has had very little bearing on the overall continuity of Star Trek, and thus it doesn't matter that their depiction of April is a white man.",startrek,Canon - Ta Da!!

Most episodes alternate between scenes of people crying and awesome eye candy followed by interpersonal drama while paying lip service to the macguffin of the season.

1651595510,"First, I want to start by saying that I love the Motion Picture. I know it's fans debate if it's a good Trek film or not, but the pace, the music, the story, just fit Trek so perfectly in my humble opinion. Yes, I love the others (even 5) but TMP feels like it wasn't influenced by the action of movies like Star Wars. It fit the ""exploration"" parts of Trek so much more than other films.    

Now, this post is about tiny little thing, it's basically me nick picking, but it always bothered me when I watched the movie.  

Epsilon 9 is discussing the cloud with Enterprise, and Branch mentions the cloud is ""over 82 AUs in diameter.""  

Really? 82 AUs?  

Here's the thing: Neptune is only around 30 AUs from the sun, and Pluto is only 39 AUs away, so the cloud is more than twice the size of our Solar System? That seemed way, *way* too big. By the time the outer edges of the cloud reached earth, the center of the cloud, where Voyager 6 actually is, might be around Pluto.  

As a side note: Voyager 1 is currently 155 AUs from us.  

Today, I just had that feeling of *""I want to watch TMP,""* so I fired it up, and noticed my iTunes copy included the Director's Cut. I've seen the theatrical so many times, I wanted to see if I could notice any differences. Sure enough, Branch now says that the cloud is only 2 AUs in diameter. Seems more believable. Clearly, I wasn't the only one that thought 82 AUs was too much, if they purposefully made the change.

1651593724,"I finished watching all of Voyager several months ago and have been on DS9 for a while now, but dang. Every once in a while I suddenly remember the episode ""Drone""  and get all choked up. Yeah, I'm a sucker for plot lines involving Borg (especially Seven), but this was on a whole different level. A synopsis is ahead, but the tl;dr is that this is an awesome episode that is pretty pivotal in showcasing Seven's journey to reclaim her humanity after being rescued from the Borg.

For those who may not remember, this episode begins with Seven. She is in her quarters and standing before a small mirror. The reflection shows that she is practicing her smile, something she never did as a drone in the Borg collective. She is trying to relearn the trait when she is interrupted by The Doctor. They are a part of an away crew investigating a rapidly expanding nebula. While on the shuttle, some sort of wave erupts from the nebula, necessitating an emergency beam out.  There is a transporter malfunction (of course) that results in Seven's nanoprobes merging with The Doctor's mobile emitter following the transport.

The issue is undetected at first. They realize the emitter appears fused and is malfunctioning, but Lt. Torres thinks she can fix it easily enough. She sets it aside for repairs and during the night the device reactivates itself. It goes on to extract a tissue sample (thereby collecting DNA) from an unwitting crew member and the result is Seven's ""son"" - a Borg drone who is highly advanced (The Doctor's mobile emitter utilized tech from centuries into the future, don't forget). In the span of a single episode, the drone rapidly progresses from infancy to adulthood, and the crew - Seven, most notably - must grapple with the complexities of an anomaly like this.

Initially, they are understandably apprehensive by the presence of a Borg fetus with accelerated growth in a maturation chamber impenetrable to anyone but Seven. She has never seen the Borg reproduce in this fashion and also points out they have no way of knowing how dangerous he is...or will be. Will he try to connect with the hive? Will he summon them to Voyager's coordinates and be responsible for the assimilation of the entire crew?

Seven urges Captain Janeway to act immediately, but the latter wants to avoid unnecessary loss of life. Although Seven believes that action is warranted, Janeway points out the similarities between Seven and this new life. They are both Borg, yet simultaneously not. They are individuals who are disconnected from the collective. She encourages Seven to take responsibility for him. To raise him, teach him, and shape him. While somewhat unsure, Seven acquiesces.

When the fully grown Borg emerges from the maturation chamber, Seven - accompanied by a security team - is there. The Borg drone, later aptly named ""One,"" has the appearance of an adult male, but a childlike, inquisitive spirit. One asks numerous questions about his role and how he is supposed to function, but has no ability to comprehend Seven's nuanced responses about his individuality that contradict his basic programming.

Seeing that One simply doesn't have the capacity to understand what they are attempting to communicate to him, Seven tries to utilize a direct neural interface to provide instructions and data directly to him. In the process, he takes over the connection and begins probing Seven, hungry for all the knowledge she contains. She nearly collapses from it, but manages to speak and tells him, ""You are hurting me."" He disconnects, Seven regains her composure, and informs One he must always comply with her instructions. One hesitates and for a split second the crew is on edge as they wait for his response. After a beat, One says, ""I will comply.""

Seven begins the daunting task of instructing One, along with some assistance from Neelix and The Doctor. She is emphatic that they are individuals, not the Borg. She gives him data to download and he is overwhelmed by it. It's too much for him. She replies, ""You will adapt.""

As One matures, he develops an insatiable desire for knowledge. Seven has to set limits, not wanting him to take on too much too soon. He is eager to please and be accepted by the rest of the crew. When he meets Captain Janeway, he asks, ""Am I sufficient?"" She assures him their meeting is not for the purpose of determining his adequacy, but to get to know him. 

He is also increasingly curious about his origins and asks numerous questions about the Borg, which are deflected by Seven and the others.

One continues to grow in his capabilities and becomes an active, helpful member of the crew. When Seven takes him to engineering, he is able to calculate the rate of expansion within the nearby nebula. This endears him to Torres, as the solution to this problem had long eluded her.

Although One's appearance still intimidates some crew members, his progress is impressive and it's clear that he wants to be of service and is embracing the complexity of individuality. He even speaks in ""I"" statements instead of the ""we"" typical of Borg.

He shares quarters with Seven and regenerates in an alcove adjacent to hers. But one night, Seven's regeneration cycle is interrupted by Janeway, Tuvok, and a security team. One activated a beacon and a Borg vessel is rapidly approaching Voyager.

Seven quickly shuts down One's regeneration cycle and he steps out of the alcove. When she confronts him about the signal, he is confused and points out she disabled his transceiver as soon as he'd emerged from the maturation chamber. Upon examining him, Seven realizes that the nanoprobes in his bloodstream adapted to this and developed a secondary transceiver which sent a beacon when One shut down for his regeneration cycle.

The Voyager crew spring into action. They have almost no chance against a Borg vessel, but they are going to do everything possible to stay alive‚Ä¶and keep One safe too. If the Borg were to get ahold of his advanced, 29th century technology there would not only be no hope for them. All of humanity would be doomed.

Janeway decides it's time One had his questions answered about his Borg history. She and Seven show him footage of The Federation's previous encounters with the Borg and the destruction that followed. Janeway reiterates that the crew do not want to be assimilated, as it would kill their distinctiveness. They would no longer be unique individuals. They would be drones. One doesn't seem sure how to respond to this. Moments later, when in a turbolift with Seven, he asks, ""You do not wish to rejoin the collective?""

""Voyager is my collective,"" she replies.

When the two of them disembark and step onto the bridge, it's obvious that there is a substantial amount of tension and fear. There's a red alert and the Borg have hailed Voyager. Janeway opens a channel and their message comes through. They will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Prepare to be boarded.

Both One and Seven appear to be almost hypnotized by the call of the Borg. One informs Seven he can hear them calling to him and she admits she can hear it too.

""Billions of voices speaking as one,"" she murmurs, a dazed expression on her face.

Janeway exchanges a look of concern with Chakotay, but at that moment Seven turns to One and tells him they must resist that voice or Voyager will be destroyed. She provides him with a station where he can access the shields and use his own advanced tech to supplement them, but One appears to have already formulated a plan.

His expression, once marked by innocence and curiosity, now appears grim and aged. Having accumulated the knowledge of Seven and every drone before her, having seen the devastation the Borg have wrought with his own eyes, and having heard the personal pleas of Janeway and Seven, he now understands what he must do.

He takes control of the bridge, connects his own interface with Voyager's, remodulates the shields, and provides enchantments to weapons systems as he gives orders to the distressed crew members on the bridge. He possesses the composure and competence of an experienced senior officer and the crew that once feared him now respond to his every command with relief and confidence.

He then explains that he will need to board the Borg vessel so he can sabotage its systems and destroy it. Seven reminds One the Borg will attempt to assimilate him. He gives her a slight smile and answers, ""They will fail.""

Janeway instructs Harry Kim to get a lock onto him, but One explains that is not necessary. He then activates his personal transport and beams himself onto the opposing ship. Once aboard, One announces to the Borg that they have no chance against his technological superiority and to immediately end their attack on Voyager or he will destroy them. The Borg ignore him and restate their intentions to assimilate him and the Voyager crew. Seeing they do not intend to retreat, One turns and heads towards an alcove. He is intercepted by multiple drones, but they are no match for him. He succeeds in reaching the alcove where he is able to disrupt their navigational controls and steer them into the nearby nebula.

Seven watches helplessly from the bridge on Voyager as the Borg vessel's hull collapses in on itself while inside the nebula. Everything indicates that One perished along with the Borg and she appears devastated, but as Janeway is in the process of dispatching repair crews to the damaged decks, One's life signal is detected amidst the wreckage. He has erected a force field around himself and has survived.

One is transported directly to sickbay and Seven rushes to his side. The Doctor is already preparing for surgery and explains that One's technical components are already rapidly repairing themselves, but his human body is failing and they must prepare to operate immediately.

In a raspy voice, One tells Seven he was never meant to be. He is only a random convergence of technologies.

""You are unique,"" protests Seven.

But One tells Seven that as long as he exists, she is in danger. All of Voyager is in danger. The Borg are now aware of him. They will try to find him.

""They will fail,"" she assures him.

The Doctor intervenes and informs them their conversation will have to wait so that he can operate. When he attempts to sedate One, he is deflected by a force field.

Seven steps in and orders One to allow The Doctor to proceed. When he doesn't respond, Seven insists he must comply. He only looks at her and she repeats, her voice now trembling, ""You must comply.""

But she has raised an individual. Not a drone. And he declares emphatically, ""I will not.""

Seven's voice breaks as she pleads, ""Please. You are hurting me.""

His synapses are failing and alarms chirp in the background. With his final breath, he speaks his last words. Words that are an echo of what Seven told him whenever he was overwhelmed or could not fully understand something yet.

""You will adapt.""

One's death reveals a part of Seven's humanity that she had yet to reawaken: grief. In the final scene, Seven stands before the mirror in her quarters. But she is not practicing her smile and instead, the mirror reflects a tear on her cheek.

""Drone"" is a new favorite episode of mine. Props to J. Paul Boehmer for his portrayal of One as well. Boehmer has portrayed multiple characters throughout various episodes across the Star Trek franchise and has fantastic chemistry with the rest of the Voyager cast, but this was a particularly strong performance for him. He exhibited incredible range in his depiction of One, a complicated character with significant development throughout the entirety of the episode. Boehmer nailed everything from One's early delight and bewilderment at the world around him to his eventual transformation into a somber leader on the bridge who ultimately chooses to die in order to save Seven and his fellow crew members.

This is also a notable episode in developing Seven's storyline further. It builds on the intricacies of her character previously established a couple episodes prior, during which she chose to sacrifice herself rather than risk the deaths of a handful of crew members in stasis. It was a significant moment in the series and arguably one that foreshadowed the decision made later by One (and if you doubt me, I'd like to add that the episode was titled ""One,"" which I don't think was a coincidence).

The culmination is a fuller, richer portrait of Seven and her character. Yes, she is stunning, intelligent, and capable. As much as I appreciate those qualities, they aren't what make her most intriguing as a character and they aren't what draw me to her.

Seven, I think, understands and embodies sacrifice more than any other character from the series. She knows what it means to suffer and to endure. She is seemingly built for it and only comes out stronger. True to the words of the Borg, she always adapts. Not only does she adapt, she thrives. Even her grief is put to good use; it seems to open a door to a tender, more expressive Seven who discovers she possesses remarkable musical talent, a passion for the culinary arts, and more. It prepares her for her interactions with Icheb and the other children Voyager rescues from the disabled Borg vessel in season six. Most significantly, Seven is a symbol of hope to those who have experienced tremendous loss. Certainly to her fictional counterparts, but I find her inspiring and won't discount the possibility of the character's potential to touch other viewers as well.

It's now 2022. 

My brain's on overdrive right now looking for comparisons. Just...crazy. I pointed it out to my mom the other day and she called Roddenberry a ""prophet."" I wouldn't go that far, but of course the ""prophet"" reference made me giggle and think of DS9.

Anyway...those are my Trekkie musings for the week! One funny and one...not so funny... oO",startrek,A Crazy Realization During My Next Gen Rewatch
1651540360,"I had a thought today. What if instead of de-aging Brent Spiner / Data, Picard had dreamt of Data as an older version of himself (since it was a dream sequence, there's no Canon reason why Data had to look exactly like Data). 

It could have been worked into the plot... Picard regrets that Data never got to be an ""old man"". Or that time is slipping away. And avoided some kind of imperfect deep fake action. 

How would you have felt about it?",startrek,Would you have liked it better... (S1 Picard)
1651539690,"Has someone swapped out  Picard and some of the other crew members with less competent a-holes?

They seem to act completely out of character.

First the space baby. They kill it's mother and when it tries to feed from the ship, they try to shake it off and get out. They don't show any compassion at all and don't even try to make sure it's gonna be ok and can survive without a mother. Basically it's someone else's problem now, bye!

Then the dr. Timicin episode. Picard basically says not my problem, let them murder him and other  60 year olds. He clearly doesn't want to die and isn't ok with it. This seems clearly out of character for Picard because they always have interfered before and at least tried to negotiate change or searched the laws to find a way out, like say they didn't just leave Wesley to die after he broke the glass thing. This seemed really dark and messed up.

Amd finally, the last episode where Worf and the new Klingon emperor asked for help. Not helping seemed like strategically absolutely idiotic choice, risking your ally to fall to rebellion who would then turn them over to your enemy. Nor does it seem to contradict with any federation directives I know of. The emperor was lawfully elected and those who opposed them were basically just terrorists at that point since they ignored the local laws plus their ally and the legally elected leader asked for aid. 

Oh right and Picard would have let Worf die in that episode. Picard of s1-3 would never have made that choice and would have done everything to get him out.. like put the Enterprise between the line of fire or at least tried to beam him out.",startrek,Just finished watching TNG season 4 and I'm confused..
1651539200,"Hi everyone.  Not much notice on this, but tomorrow afternoon my friend and I will be conducting an oral history interview via Zoom with William Sargent who played Dr. Thom Leighton in TOS The Conscience of the King.  These are the questions we are planning to ask him.  Anyone got anything the REALLY want to know about the making of this episode ?

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Lets start with your early biography.  You were born in 1930 under the name Wolf Jacobowicz and you and your family emigrated to Palestine in 1933 and you grew up under the British Mandate of Palestine.  Can you tell us a bit about your family and your early life ?

2)	You emigrated to the United States in 1947 and you were drafted to fight in Korea as an American soldier in 1951 can you tell us about this part of your life ?

3)	After Korea in 1953 you would have been 23 years old and you used the GI Bill to study at the Neighbourhood Playhouse in New York.  Can you talk to us about the transition from soldier to actor ?

4)	You studied theatre from 1953 to 1955 can you tell us any stories about learning your craft ?

5)	In the 1950s you changed your name from Wolf Jacobowicz to William Sergant.  Where did this name come from ?

6)	You started acting professionally in the mid 1950s do you have any stories about your early theatre career ?

7)	In 1960 you moved to Hollywood.  Your first imdb credit is for a legal drama called ‚Äúthe law and mrs jones‚Äù where you played a doctor.  Do you have any stories about how you got the part and how you transition from acting on stage to acting in front of a camera ?

8)	In 1962 Richard Basehart played Adolf Hitler in a movie.  You were cast as Court von Stauffenberg, a man who infamously failed in his attempt to assassinate Hitler.  As a German born jewish man who grew up during the war how did you prepare for this role ?

9)	In the early to mid 1960s you did a number of guest appearances in American television, but you made multiple different appearances on Dr. Kildare.  Why did they keep asking you back?

10)	So in 1966 you were cast in the 13th episode of Star Trek called ‚ÄúThe Conscience of the King‚Äù.  Do you remember much about the casting process or the production ?

11)	In your Star Trek episode Arnold Moss plays Karidian a planetary governor who commits genocide and only a handful of people including you and Captain Kirk can identify him.  Karidian seems to be a space-age stand in for some of the infamous nazis like Eichmann and Dr. Mengele.  I‚Äôm wondering if this is something we are reading into, or if the performers with aware of it at the time and if it influenced the performances?

12)	Obviously you shot your scenes and moved onto the next job, and of course Star Trek was cancelled a few years later.  When did you first realize that this show was having a second life in syndication?

13)	According to production records you did two days of work on this episode on September 13th and September 15th 1966.  How does it feel for two days of work to follow you for 50 years?  Has it been a blessing or a curse?

14)	You had roles in a number of popular shows in the 1960s like Mission Impossible, The Twlight Zone and Peyton place, do you have any stories about this time in your life? 

15)	In the 1970s and 1980s you continued acting in television, and did a lot of theatrical work.  Do you have any stories about this period of your life?

16)	In 1987 you and your wife relocated to Salt Lake City and you ran a theatre.  What prompted the move to Salt Lake ?

17)	Your Theatre in Sale Lake lasted for 4 seasons, do you have any highlights from this point in your life?

18)	What kind of difficulties did you encounter operating a theatre in Utah ?

19)	Getting back to Star Trek, have you ever attended a Star Trek convention ÔÉ† If yes, do you have any stories ÔÉ† If no, why not?

20)	You have been very receptive to receiving fan mail and autograph requests at your home.  Do you have any stories about interesting letters you‚Äôve received or strange items people have asked you to autograph ?

21)	 In your career, what was your favoritiure performance or production and left favorite performance prodution

22)	You spent decades working in Hollywood and American theatre.  Was there ever anyone you met or worked with where you became starstruck ?

23)	You‚Äôve been retired for a number of years.  Do you miss it?

24)	You are now 91 years old, looking back on your life, what would your message be for the younger generations?

25)	I suspect its going to be mostly Star Trek fans listening to this, what would you say to the Trekkies who are listening to this ?",startrek,"I am doing an oral history interview with a TOS guest star tomorrow, what do you all think of these questions"

Voyager in particular is the Star Trek I wish for the most because when I started watching it I just fell in love with the idea of them being lost in a different quadrant. 

When I first started watching Star Trek in like the 10th grade probably 6 some years ago I looked up the air dates of the shows and watched them in order. 

So first I watched TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, Discovery had a few seasons by the time I made it that far. I fell in love with TOS, I stayed because of TNG, DS9 made me interested in the other quadrants, but Voyager was an entire show in a different quadrant. And I loved it to death. Still do but there are a lot of episodes that I kind of just don‚Äôt like anymore after seeing the show like 20 times. DS9 is definitely my favorite for Story Telling, and TNG for episodic. Voyager is not my favorite there are a lot of issues in the story and things that just done make since. But when you are watching it for the first time do you really thinking about it that deeply?

1651524627,"Greetings, fellow redditors! 

While many of you may have discovered the series by watching TNG/DS9/VOY, or maybe even the original series, my first contact with the franchise watching Star Trek: Discovery.

I watched DISCO's first season without knowing anything about the franchise. Therefore, I didn't have any expectations on what a ST series should be. While I liked it, there are some aspects of the series I felt were wasted. 

While I'd later learned that DISCO's Klingons were supposed to represent racist americans, my first impression was that they were a analogy to anti-USA/anti-imperialist and nationalist factions in the modern world, like pan-arabism and Islamic fundamentalism. I think my perception actually fits them better: contrary to US far-right movements, who inhabit what's one of the most prosperous countries in the world and fear ""contamination"" from people who came from poorer countries, the Klingons are a divided and relatively weak (compared to their foes) people fighting a prosperous superpower they perceive as imperialist. Many people outside the US have a very similar view: that the culture of the mighty USA is destroying their own due to its influence. T'kuvma himself is a representation of it: he is extremely xenophobic towards alien (by ""alien"" I mean non-klingon) races, but is actually progressive when it comes to other Klingons, accepting outcasts like Voq and promoting unity among his people.

(A situation which could serve as a better analogy for USA's racist problem would be intolerance against romulan immigrants after the supernova, for example).

Because of this impression, since the first episode I thought we'd get a nuanced portrayal of the conflict and the enemies. The klingon side wouldn't be shown as fundamentally good, but we'd get to understand their motivations and even sympathize with them a little. Voq could represent the best aspects of this klingon neo-nationalist movement (end of fights and intolerance between Klingons), while others could represent the worst. Maybe we could see that the Federation, while not exactly evil, has been failing to adequately interact with the Klingons and to understand how much they've been affecting them. 

I was quite disappointed by the rest of the season. We didn't get to explore the Klingons and their ideology that much, specially after Voq's ""disappearance"". T'kuvma and Voq, two characters which I found extremely interesting, died quickly (or, in Voq's case, were completely changed). On the Federation's side, the imperfect, morally grey captain was revealed to be a mustach twirling villain. The way they ended the war was also quite unsatisfying. I couldn't help but feel the series' themes could have been better explored...

Now, years after my first watch, my opinion hasn't changed that much. I was extremely satisfied when I watched Deep Space 9, because,  in many ways, it was much closer to my expectations towards Discovery: lots of nuance, complex villains, etc. The Cardassian Union is not portrayed as good, but we can understand how they became such a authoritarian civilization and feel some sympathy for some cardassian characters. 

So, what do you think?",startrek,Star Trek Discovery's Klingons: missed potential?
1651522846,I started watching Star Trek because I really wanted to watch TNG. I thought it would be a good idea to watch at least the first season of TOS before moving into TNG just so that I have a basic understanding of the lore and so that I could appreciate the changes and advancements made between the two series.

Is the purpose of the flag to create a sense of hostility and intolerance toward those who don't share the many controversial political and social views promoted by the LGBT movement?

Is this an intolerant community where Star Trek fans are unwelcome (or made to feel unwelcome) unless they happen to subscribe to all the ideas and moral values promoted by the LGBT movement?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the Star Trek franchise always promoted human goodness, inclusion, peace, tolerance and other such virtues?

How then can it be appropriate to display the banner of a highly divisive modern political movement which rails against the moral, social, and religious values of most of the world today and all human history. Not to mention it going against the views of most historical fans and producers of Star Trek, including Gene himself, who certainly did not hold to all of the extremist views espoused by the modern LGBT movement, and in any case isn't here to either agree nor disagree with them.

To me, displaying the 'pride' banner here seems like a shameless hijacking of a beloved TV franchise in order to promote minority values that have nothing to do with the show or the personal beliefs of most of its fanbase.

Does this community hold a policy of discrimination and intolerance toward those who are different and hold different political, social, or moral personal views?

I recently finished TNG. It took me nearly four years to watch it. I never felt connected to it nor did I ever feel the urge to keep watching it. Sure, there were some good and great episodes, but it all felt so dated and the majority of the episodes were not good or great in my opinion. It's a hot take, I understand that, and people will be upset by it, lol. That's okay. I have seen most of TOS and I've seen all Star Trek films. Love em. And I love the TNG characters too.

I did watch one recently in S5 that was just all around bad though. 5x05 ""Once Upon A Time"". Zzzzzzzz. Anyway, my point is that it doesn't feel like a chore for me to sit through a bad episode of Voyager like it did with TNG. 

Also! I love the fact that the interior of the ship looks like a starship and not an 80's luxury hotel, haha.

I didn't mean for this to be a TNG hate fest I promise! Voyager is just so much more exciting for me and it's a shame I waited so long to find out for myself but then again I am having a blast RIGHT NOW watching it. At least it's finally happening!

1651464845,"I have a theory about the structure of narratives in the different eras of Star Trek that I think helps explain some of why reactions to the newest era of shows has been so contentious. (I think this applies to new Dr. Who, too, but that's a whole different subreddit.)

In the first era of Trek (TOS, TAS), narratives are more akin to histories. TOS was written in the golden age of social science fiction. The complexity we see in the narrative is meant to help us understand these societies and the people in them. For example, in 'Balance of Terror', we learn about the Federation-Romulan War and the Vulcan-Romulan connection in order for us to understand the motivations of the various characters, what their societies value, etc.

In the second era of Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT), narratives are psychological dramas. The complexities of the narratives are meant to help us understand the people in these situations. It's still social science fiction, but we're trying to understand the individual people. Worf isn't just a Klingon, he's a Klingon who spent a lot of time disconnected from a culture he's not really sure he can claim any more. Kira is trying to figure out how to live in a complicated world after growing up (and being comfortable) in a morally black-and-white world. Janeway struggles to hold on to values that were at the bedrock of her identity until she was so far away from home that it wasn't clear they really work any more.

Between the second and third eras for Trek, television writers maxed out the complexity that a narrative can have that still works like a narrative. Lost, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc. They had huge casts and complex stories. Writers and producers in the second era of Trek were operating under the assumption that audiences wouldn't accept that, but the success of Lost showed that we would. But, by the time that Trek creators were ready to start on the third era, that complexity had been taken as far as anyone would accept.

In the third era of Trek (DSC, PIC), narratives are vehicles for emotional catharsis. The complexity of the narrative isn't meant to stand up to the kind of scrutiny that second era plots were. The Burn and  The DMA and whatever Q is up to aren't meant to be examined the way that we could rationalize the politics of the Romulan Senate or the great houses of the Klingon Empire. They're a backdrop that lets us experience Su'Kal's grief and Book's loneliness and Michael's anger and Stammet's desperation and Adira's longing. It's why PIC stops the action for Picard himself to remember the trauma of his childhood, so we can experience his regret. 

I find Picard's emotional journey through PIC really compelling, especially his feelings of regret about a life that very few people around him would criticize. I can easily see, however, how a person in a different place in their life would find absolutely nothing resonant about it, and they'd be left holding the strange pieces of the plot and wondering what in the world is going on.

Similarly, there are parts of DSC that hit me really hard. I've had emotions that felt like they could've shaken the universe. (Fortunately, I'm not a Kelpian who grew up on a massive dilithium deposit. It makes sense to me, though, that if that emotional catharsis doesn't work for you, you'd wonder what all the fuss of a complicated plot was for if all it lead to was emotional catharsis.

(Side note: The Flux in the latest season of Dr. Who is very much akin to The Burn and The DMA. If the emotional journey of The Doctor doesn't resonate with you, you'd be justified in asking what the point of all the running around is for when the answers are so sparse. I don't think we're really supposed to understand. We're supposed to feel the same confusion and desperation The Doctor feels for the world ending that I feel when I watch the news.)

TL;DR: The complicated plots in DSC and PIC don't make sense because they aren't supposed to. They're scaffolding to get us to the point where we can experience an emotional catharsis with the characters.",startrek,A theory about narratives and the eras of Star Trek

Star trek is the wild west on a much more massive scale. Each and every planet has a planet's worth of mysteries to solve and unlock.
The idea of one little small island on some random planet (or moon) or asteroid even, and there is some long lost runaway genius holding up there. He uses technology to the utmost affect for his desires. He has a small horde of animals; pigs cows etc, so he can eat how he likes. 
A garden with *every* spice and vegetable/fruit in the galaxy. 
And then he's hidden inside some dispersion zone which blocks sensors etc. 
On just one planet, there are so many possible mysteries to discover. In star trek, there are infinite planets. 
You're venturing into the unknown.

Different stories benefit from different amounts of space. A heavily serialized story with everything revolving around a single main plot benefits from a tighter focus with a shorter episode count, while a more episodic show with different paths to explore throughout the season would benefit from having more episodes to stretch its wings.

The Q collective has represented what we will inevitably become if we continue to feed our thirst for exploration, invention, and knowledge. They've become masters of space and time, essentially godlike. 

In Star Trek: Picard, however, Q exhibits a new behavior we haven't seen before: Meta references. He references old episode titles, and also says this to Picard:

Q knows that the writers of the show are planning to write him off, to kill him. Hence why he can ""sense his death looming on the horizon,"" and also why he seems to say it's not a *proper death*, but instead some transition into nonexistence: **Since no living being actually knows what death is like, we can't ever make fictional characters experience it ""properly,"" we can only show what it looks like from the outside, since that's the only way any of us have observed death.**

First there's Moriarty in TNG who sets of whole discussions of morality and sentience and the complexity there. 

Then there's Vic Fontaine in DS9 who is ""sentient"" and knows he's a holodeck character. He also meddles in things outside the holodeck (like accessing personnel files and calling Odos office from the holodeck), but there isn't the same discussion of sentience here. It's just accepted that this is what it is. 

Then we have the Doctor on Voyager, who starts to challenge questions about AI purpose and rights and citizenship. 

So- how do all these holodeck characters fit together? How do you perceive each of them and our main characters reactions to their sentience? Are they all truly sentient?

If the Borg are made to be non conquering friendly Borg then they never would assimilate the El Aurian home world, Sauran and Guinan never end up in the Nexus nor does Kirk because the B doesn't have to rescue them, Sauron therefore never tried to get back to the Nexus so the D is never destroyed, the Borg don't go back to stop first contact so, (and granted this is kind of a leap) but Data would not have been killed trying to save the E from Picard clone. So Data due to the changes is still alive and there reason the entire cast is reuniting for season 3 is because they all, including Data are still serving on board the USS ENTERPRISE 1701-D. Adversely since there was never a Borg threat the Defiant never existed and without WOLF 359 Sisko is still living and serving with Jake and Jennifer who also was never killed.

It did it in the stupidest way possible, and IMO it would have been better if it had STARTED in the future in the first place (or at least just skipped the first season entirely), but it GOT THERE. And the 3rd season was serviceable Star Trek. Is it too overly emotional for me? Sometimes. But it's REAL STAR TREK from a storytelling and overarching narrative perspective. Season 4 got even better than season 3, and aside from the strangely timed feels and really (REALLY) stupid flamethrowers on the bridge, I enjoyed season 4. They converted me. I HATED Discovery through the end of Season 2. But little by little they broke down my misgivings and I found the Trek they actually embraced through their characters and storytelling in these past 2 seasons.

But I just got done with Picard, Season 2 Episode 9, and my god... what a fucking abomination. Spoilers ahead for anyone who cares.

When Patrick Stewart made that announcement that ""Picard is coming back"" and had all those interviews about how he had all these misgivings and didn't want to tarnish the character and his legacy, I was so confident in his decision and that it would be at least ""good"". Maybe not great, but good.

Season 1 had so many problems, but I didn't absolutely despise it. They bastardized years of character development by killing and/or ruining established legacy characters with bad storytelling and contrived plot devices, but I was willing to look past it because I know that lots of shows, especially Sci-Fi ones, can have a rocky first season as they get shit figured out. I wasn't thrilled that it seemed to go against everything Stewart had promised, but I was hopeful when they showed John de Lancie as Q returning for Season 2 (Picard's greatest nemesis and foil, and one of the best characters and actors to lend their guest stardom to Star Trek). I thought... ""HOW could season 2 get worse than season 1 with Q/John de Lancie around?!"".

But here we are. I don't have the patience to go through the whole season. Needless to say there have been so many reviewers who have done a better job than I could do tearing this waste of time and money apart. But after Episode 9, I just couldn't hold back anymore. The amount of plot holes, disregard for established character traits and universal standards, the complete lack of what seems to be ANY fucks given to coherent storytelling... I am sad. Sad and angry. Sad that, at best, Patrick Stewart and all of these actors and actresses were duped into taking part in one of the worst possible instances of Star Trek ever created, or, at worst, all of these actors and actresses, some I've loved for years from their prior work, knowingly participated in the lowering and tarnishing of the Star Trek name.

I will just list this shit out that either makes no sense, goes against established norms in the Star Trek universe, or is just blatant plot hole territory, and this is JUST from episode 9:

* The ""borg"" reveal their positions with laser-sights that serve no purpose since they have clean shots based on the position of the laser (on Picard and other character's vital spots) but don't take the shots, but disable them when Soong walks in front of them... WHY? Did their need to possibly shoot someone more accurately stop after he walks in front of them?

* Seven, and literally every other character in the show, are trying to sneak around, yet can't SHUT THE FUCK UP and speak in normal voices and make noises while trying to be stealthy. ELNOR LITERALLY SLAMS LOCKERS OPEN AND CLOSED SECONDS AFTER THE QUEEN AND SEVERAL BORG WALK BY THE OPEN DOOR TO THE ROOM HE IS IN. Are they just stupid, or does the show think viewers will not care that they are not paying attention to the details??

* Why does it matter if the ECH/Elnor get hit? He's a hologram with a mobile emitter on. He goes offline when the Queen's tentacle goes through his torso. Why? If she hit the emitter... sure I guess it would make sense. But she didn't. But also...

* ...Why does the Elnor hologram need the mobile emitter at all? The entire ship has holo-emitters, as established multiple times when holograms of Rios have existed all over the ship.

* Why does the Elnor hologram have Elnors memories? Why would he have Elnor's INTERNAL DYING MOMENTS IN ITS MEMORY????? WHY IS IT ELNOR AT LALL?! No explanation is given to this. Why does he know how to use a sword? It makes no sense. Why would a hologram with the ECH programming think a sword would be more efficient than literally any other method in its programming against ""borg"" with guns?

* The story with Picard's mother... why? Why does ANY of this matter? Yeah, I get it, Picard's mother died and he buried the memory, and that's subconsciously why he never settled down with anyone. But why does this matter? They're running for their lives from ""borg"" and Soong but they have time to stop and flashback to his mother hanging herself? There were no records of this he would have come across as an adult (I'm assuming his mother hanging himself would be in some police or autopsy or any number of other records)? Also, it was the fucking 2300's. You're telling me whatever was wrong with her, the only solution was locking her in a room? Using a fucking skeleton key that your child knows where is hidden?

* Also, with regards to Picard's memory, really? REALLY?! How many fucking telepaths over the years have shared Picard's memories and emotions? Troi has known him for how long and never caught a glimpse? Sarek? Spock?!? There was NO HINT of that in there? It took old age and causing a potential huge fuck up to the timeline in order to drag that out of him? Please. PLEASE give me the fucking strength because the character I grew up loving who is the TITLE of the show I don't give 2 shits about now and serves almost no real narrative purpose throughout the entire season.

* Seven is still a complete shell of her former character. She literally said, ""Those aren't people, they're borg"" when they are VERY CLEARLY PEOPLE. They aren't even fully assimilated! They have been assimilated WAY less time than even Picard was as Locutus. Picard FULLY PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY (give or take) RECOVERED from being assimilated COMPLETELY into the collective. EVERY SINGLE PERSON that the Queen ""assimilated"" could be saved... but she's happy to murder them.

* ... and I suppose killing all these ""drones"" has no ripple affects on the timeline, huh? No ""butterflies"" from needlessly killing random people assimilated in the year 2024 could cause guys? None of these people could procreate and help create fucking Zefram Cochrane? Yeah, that's right. He wasn't born until the 2030's. HOW DO THEY KNOW ITS OK TO KILL THESE PEOPLE? Seven and Raffi fucking STAB ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THROUGH THE THROAT! There is no settings on ""stun"" happening here. It's just mass murder.

* In fact, they've done nothing BUT create ""butterflies"". The entire timeline is fucked. It doesn't matter if they undo whatever Q or Soong may or may not do with Renee Picard. They've all created such gigantic temporal fuckups that they're gonna have to go back in time another dozen times just to unkill all the people and undo all the stupid things they've done.

* Seven name-drops Janeway talking about why she didn't join Starfleet, so she's obviously still around and likely still an Admiral. But they didn't let Seven join because she was once a borg? THEN WHY THE FUCK WAS ICHEB ALLOWED IN? He was COMMAND too based on his uniform in the 1st season! He had visible implants and was assimilated for a long time just like Seven. Why was he allowed in? Why was Picard allowed to become an Admiral for that matter? Is ANY Starfleet officer who was assimilated not allowed to be in Starfleet? If so, then why are Janeway, B'Elanna, and Tuvok allowed to remain in starfleet considering they were all assimilated during the Unimatrix Zero episodes (the Doctor's anti-assimilation inoculation wears off and Tuvok even starts hearing the collective, etc)????? What about any number of other Starfleet officers that have been assimilated over the years. Were they all not allowed to rejoin after they recovered?

* Rios is able to instantly decipher and use the wall panel in the Watcher's apartment? Why? How? What? This can likely be explained away with any number of things, but the fact that they don't at any point setup why it is possible or give a clue in the moment as to why he can annoys the shit out of me.

* Where was the Watcher's transport tech the other 100 times the ship's transporter was conveniently on the fritz or not working accurately? WHERE?!

* All of the characters are completely content to allow the ""borg queen"" to get literally exactly what she wants. No objections, no ""WTF?!"" from Picard, nothing. She takes the ship, which is what she ORIGINALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, and leaves. The only way for them to get back. And everyone is fine with it because she ""saved Seven"" after mortally wounding her... Excuse me? Because she has never been deceptive before... at all. Right?!

* WHERE IS Q? Still hanging around somehow able to infiltrate the FBI, create advanced genetic medication that has a built in timer, and/or become an established government-associated psychologist WITHOUT HIS POWERS?

I could keep going, but I'm getting an ulcer.

Needless to say, I don't think there is any saving Picard. And I think they know that given the announcement that they are just saying fuck it and bringing EVERYONE from TNG back for Season 3 so they can wet everyone's whistles one last time who only care about nostalgia and don't give a shit about coherent storytelling, established universe, characters with established backstory, or plots that aren't made of swiss cheese. Fan service is the prime directive of Picard, and it is absolutely infuriating. I love me some fan service normally. But this is just Star Drek: The Next Paycheck to the writers. The lack of care and attention to detail is unforgivable at this point.

Memory Beta (non-canon Trek) also speculates some association between V'ger and the Borg (Spock even says, ""Resistance is futile"" in the movie).  What do folk here think about that?

I also had to mention Shatner's open-mouthed ""acting"" in the penultimate scene. The camera cuts to him three times with that same look of befuddlement and I literally laughed out loud. (Tried without luck to find a photo to link).

1651372957,"Discovery is very a modern show. It is in line with what contemporary audiences expect in terms of pacing, style, direction, acting, etc.. It has mostly new characters, and lean as heavily on a familiarity with Trek as Picard and Lower Decks do.
I think the show has been successful is expanding what Trek ""is"". As a result however, it doesn't feel indicative of Trek as a whole. It does not feel like a successor to the Star Trek of old in the way that TNG did or even Voyager and Enterprise. While a good recommendation for a show, all this makes it tough to direct folks to watch when they are looking to get into the franchise.

Nearly 30 years after its release, TNG is still the best entry point to the franchise and giving a sense what it is (largely) all about. That said as much as I love it as an entry point for new fans it is not without its flaws. Like all entertainment(Discovery included), it is a product of its time. The style, acting, pacing, effects, directing, etc. can be a barrier for some. As much as it bums me out, there are plenty of people out there who just can't get into older shows. Of course, there is also the issue with the first couple seasons being weak and especially dated. Its hard to explain to folks that they should start in a specific season, or even a specific episode.

Enter Strange New Worlds. It promises a return to form in terms of classic Trek stories and episodic storytelling. On the other hand, from all I've seen it is also an unmistakably modern show. Something to carry the baton of TOS and TNG. It has iconic characters and settings (Spock, the Enterprise, Uhura) that general audiences are familiar with. It allows them to go in feeling like they have some degree of comfort and familiarity, without feeling like they need to have seen another show to enjoy. If all of these elements are executed well, it had the potential to be ""the best of both worlds"". Here's hoping!

tl;dr : A show which looks to present a sense of what quintessential Trek ""is"", in a highly accessible and modern package.",startrek,Prediction/Hope: Strange New Worlds will be the best new entry point to the franchise.
1651372364,"How is the distinction between universes vs timelines drawn?

I would've thought that the existence of a multiverse means it's just an endless web of different universes spawning from every choice being made differently.

Like the mirror universe spun off when Z.C. shot the first contact Vulcuns rather than greeting them (or diverged before that at whatever point made Z.C. the type of person who'd do that). 

But then you see all sorts of examples in Star Trek, without spoiling anything going on recently, of ""they changed our timeline"". Like the Borg going back in First Contact leads to earth changing for the Enterprise while it's stuck in the temporal wake. Mean, the Kevlin timeline seems to be a new universe created by a trip from the Prime timeline going back into its past and its arrival being the start of this new branch universe. It didn't ""change the timeline"" so that Vulcun was destroyed in the prime universe.

1651364134,"So something came to mind recently when I was thinking about Picard season 2, something no one's talking about. 

If the Borg Queen on the Star Gazer is Jurati, then there would be two Juratis at once since we saw one of them was on the bridge already. This is evidence that both the Federation and Confederation timelines will occur in parallel, since without the Confederation timelines existing, Jurati wouldn't have gone back in time and become the new Borg Queen. 

So what I think is gonna happen is the Sirena crew will cause both timelines to happen in the finale episode. Then Q will bring them back to the moment before they self destruct the Stargazer, since he took them away from there in the first place. Even if they tried to go back to the 25th century through time travel, who knows what timeline they would end up in? That's why Q needs to be involved. 

Then the new Borg will join the Federation. Agnes will be alive as herself. Rios will be there at the captains chair even if he stays in the past. Elnor will be alive at Starfleet academy. This is because the versions of those characters who stayed in the past or died were the Confederation timelines version of themselves, simply made lucid to both timelines by Q. 

What I don't know is how they will handle memory. Will Rios and Jurati somehow remember the events that played out in the past? Will Elnor remember dying?",startrek,Theory: Why the Sirena crew don't need the ship to get home. And why all the main cast will be alive when they return to the 25th century.

I really, really, really wanted to love Picard. I wanted it to be my all time favorite TV series. It just happens to be kinda... boring. The plot is grandiose and full of melodramatic conflict, it's action packed like an 80's movie, and still, I rarely feel engaged to it.

I think since the Abrams movies, Trek as a whole got dragged to a genre it doesn't really belong. The effort to reach new audiences with more action oriented plots is admirable, but I think it's fair to admit at this point that it didn't seem to work.

It got us into Space Opera territory, which is a great genre full of great stories, but when overimposed to Trek's traditional lore, it deforms it into weird shapes.

In my opinion, Trek's ""native language"" flows best in episodes focused on team mates cooperating to solve puzzles (independently of how bogus the science or challenge; it's the quality of their interaction and the innate pleasure of slowly watching something broken get fixed that counts) and the personal relations of a group of people who are among the best at their respective fields, and have to cope with the stress of the most high stakes job in the whole planet. While learning the Trombonne.

The exact mix of the crazy unpredictability of the challenges a crew of explorers may face in unknown space and the hardships of the everyday life of a high standard super professional is what makes the greatest Trek, imo. And those are the aspects that have been mostly absent in the most recent Trek.

There has been zero ""gossip at the buffet line"" scenes in the most recent Trek.

Nobody had to get ready to a Seminar.

There's been no stiff dates between socially weird science officers.

These examples may sound silly when compared with the kind of shenanigans going on in the shows, but I think that says lots about why Space Opera Trek doesn't captivate a large segment of Trek fans. It's just not as relatable.",startrek,"Trek doesn't work as a Space Opera, it shines the most as Procedural Sci-Fi/Workplace Dramedy"

 why is the Borg Queen wanting 400 years to PREP for the Confederation

and not contemplating on preventing it along with Picard and Co.

 I mean,  shes from a future where the Borg and Aliens are just Wiped out by the Humans.

being around Picard and CO (since shes plucked from her TIMELINE)  (she would be an anomaly / someone from a Future that no long exists) 

so far, how does she not  wonder what the TNG Prime Borg are like - because she'd have to assume, looking at the Romulan - and 7 of 9 That, perhaps the Borg of TNG are stronger and better.  because 7 of 9 is LIVING proof of this.   she  may not be Borg atm but she is in TNG timeline.    the Queen isn't the Last of her Kind there.

besides the wonder of how a ""confederation"" of humans only, wipe out the Borg. ontop of every non Human race in the Galaxy? but yet, this Queen doesnt think that somehow the Borg are still around in the TNG timeline?

if I were in that position ,   I would do all that I could, to prevent my future (just like Picard and CO are doing)  and I would  get my ass in the TNG timeline since I'd been plucked from my Future already - so I am an Anomaly.

First My Thoughts: So throughout this series we have dealt with Picard's inter-social issues and his past traumas.  Personally speaking, this is BS and it bogs the show down half the time in my opinion.  Picard is a strong man who like Kirk before him ""needs his pain"" to remind him of his Humanity; while he was anti-social on the Enterprise it was also justified.  He is the captain and as such its not professional or wise to pursue long term relationships or form attachments with the people under his command.  Over time its obvious in his own way that he cares for his people and he does show it more than once -he IS NOT traumatized from childhood and I don't think much of STP should be considered canon.  

\*\*So here we go, this is my ending for the series.  Please be patient.\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

Picard wakes up sweating and confused (perceiving strange computer noises) until he clearly hears Doctor Crusher speaking to him.  She is happy to see him awake and alert and explains that he has been doing very badly at a Starfleet medical facility she had him moved to in San Francisco.  During the end of TNG it was predicted that he would have ""Irumodic Syndrome"" that would cause delusions and essentially make him senile.  In the AGT episode it was based roughly around 2395, which fits with STP's time line.  There is still no cure and Picard sits back in his bed and contemplates his fate -that soon he may slip back into his dementia and never return to reality.  Shortly after the crew of the Enterprise returns to wish him well and essentially say their goodbyes.  Its at this time, with all that hes experienced in the STP episodes, he realizes that these people were his family and he tearfully wishes them all long happy lives knowing what lays ahead for him.  He knows this will be the last time he sees them. 

Geordi who is now a captain himself tells him that his ship is leaving orbit soon for a dangerous but fascinating first contact mission in unexplored space.  Picard is delighted and envious, wishing he too could be part of the adventure.  That's when Captain La Forge tells Jean-Luc that he is in fact the new skipper of the Enterprise-F (Odyssey Class from Star Trek: Online) and then asks Picard if he may have a memento to place in his new ready room.  Picard smiles and says: ""if I cannot be with you in body, at least I will be there in spirit.""  Geordi is visibly upset that his mentor is now too sick to continue on and seeing this Picard tells Geordi to ALWAYS, no matter what, ""Boldly go where no one has gone before...""  At this point the TNG music kicks up and we see Geordi beam to the Enterprise-F; a few minutes later a book or other keepsake is beamed to the Enterprise from France and Geordi looks at it fondly as he reclines back into his chair and the helmsman remarks ""course laid in, captain.""  Geordi smiles and says, ""MAKE IT SO!""  We then see the new Enterprise-F go into warp as the music drifts off into space and the adventure continues...  

I know this is a bit shortened, but its not a screen play just a rough outline.  I don't like this new Picard but it makes a lot more sense if you consider him mentally ill and delusional.  It would explain why Seven seems so dumb down on her capabilities and why the story lines seem so choppy and poorly written sometimes.  In essence each delusional character can represent a part of Picard that hes struggling with:

**Raffi:** An angry and impulsive person that is having trouble dealing with loss.  This echoes Picard's acknowledgement of his mental deterioration.

**Rios:** Picard's desire to be a young man and back in command again where he was happiest in his life.

**Jurati:** A smart but socially awkward person that is disconnected from others around her, much like Picard when he was maintaining distance from people in his life.  A part of him couldn't allow himself to connect with someone long term and its a regret that haunts him.  He wanted a connection with his crew, the people he cared most about, but isolation was his constant companion.

**Seven/Borg Queen:** A tie to his Borg past when he felt out of control and helpless; trying to fight back against the inevitable (his disease) while dealing with his guilt from Wolf 359.

**Q:** A reminder of urgent danger and struggle.  Something to focus on to keep him grounded and moving forward -much like Q did in the last episode of TNG when he was shifting through time to save the future.

**Dahj:** A reminder of Data's legacy and his strong desire to have Data back in his life after his painful loss on Shinzon's ship.

**Laris:** His desire to be with someone he loves and actually show that side of his personality without feeling vulnerable and idiotic.  A life he could have had if he hadn't joined Starfleet -its also possible she is real and living at the vineyard and a part of him does care deeply for her.

I know my choices may or may not be well received.  We Trek fans are a fickle bunch. haha  With the passing of Picard and the new missions of the Enterprise-F we see the realization of the saying: ""All good things must come to an end.""  That said, it doesn't mean that life wont continue on through others.  I'm tired of revamps and prequels.  Lets get back to the 90's Trek style of story telling that made Star Trek so good to begin with!  NuTrek could be good if the right writers/actors get behind it...  I fear if it doesn't happen, Star Trek may disappear forever and only be remembered for the new stuff and not the old.",startrek,An Idea For The Last STP Episode
1651325794,"The three that come to mind for me are

* John Lithgow. Lithgow has some good dramatic chops and I think it'd be really cool to see him as Dr Boyce in SNW. He doesn't need to be a regular cast or anything, maybe just give him an episode for his retirement where he's mixing drinks and opining on how he's watched Pike grow over the years.

* Jamie Clayton. I don't actually have a specific role in mind for her, I just really like her work and want to see her in Star Trek.

* Lamorne Morris. I loved Morris in New Girl and Woke and I think he could really bring something to any series he'd be in. I think like James Avery, he could do a lot of really good episodes from the fun and goofy to hard allegories.",startrek,"What actors would you like to see join the franchise (either as one-offs, recurring, or main cast)?"

1651321352,"I'm a TNG guy at heart, that was my Trek (was 10 when it started in '87). I grew up with it, so when they announced *Picard* I was really pumped.

Overall, I don't hate it, but it's definitely not (to my mind) as solid as the original series in terms of writing, ensemble cast, etc.

When *Discovery* came out, I *wanted* to like that show. I watched as much of it as I could stand, but aside from the issues that have been repeated ad infinitum here, the thing that most pulled me out of the show was that characters *regularly* would have deep, meaningful conversations about their emotions and other things in the middle of pitched action sequences.

Discovery didn't have *any* downtime from the action, but they wanted to be a drama and have characters that the viewers were supposed to care about. But with no time for character development between action scenes, they ended up shoehorning in these deep conversations when the world was coming down around the characters' ears. And in turn, that ruined (for me) the actual scenes. If you're in the middle of an action scene, but seem to have time to talk about your feelings while staring deep into the other character's eyes, do I really believe there's anything actually at stake?

*Picard* is now doing the same thing. I counted five separate instances of that in Ep. 09 while I watched last night-- characters in time-sensitive action sequences, and they're stopping to tell other characters (who are stopping to listen) all about their feelings, hopes, dreams, memories, etc.

I suppose this is a weakness of the format. We have a show about characters who (mostly) are supposed to be known to us, but for those who haven't seen the source material-- and for the sake of new material-- they want to have character development. But they have no *time* for character development.

I find that to be a real weakness of the modern Trek, and I hope that SNW doesn't make this mistake as well. Maybe it's the distilled story arc format that these miniseries follow, and maybe the return to something like episodic TV will help with that.

But I'm not optimistic...",startrek,Watching Picard last night solidified it for me; it's got the same pacing / drama problem that originally turned me off Discovery. (no spoilers)
1651317070,"Borg Queen Jurati drops this line like the Borg were invented during their first encounter with the Enterprise D... And this isn't the first time it's been implied this season, although I'll admit I can't remember exactly when.

I'm fairly certain the Borg existed for millennia and are still expanding their drones as they speak. Then I thought it might be a reference to assimilating Earth but the Queen specifically mentions travelling to the Delta Quadrant to do it.

Maybe the Queen means they need to expand even faster than they already are. What about all the people with guns who have Borg nano probes in their blood? Surely someone discovered them in the wall at some point before the D encounters that first cube?

Then the end of the episode happens and I'm like... Did they just do a Borg origin story?

I think I'm just tired of them continuing to neuter the Borg. Jurati just talked the Queen down.

1651265403," Ok, so, hear me out, and correct me if I view things wrong.

So far I've enjoyed DIS(Season 1-3), ENT (all of it), TNG (currently S6) and VOY (all of it), and I'm currently viewing the second season of DS9.

First of all, I have really enjoyed Star Trek thus far, but in each series there is a mayor nasty (for lack of a better word) quirk.

&amp;#x200B;

What follows are some examples of those quirks (again, I really enjoyed these series):

**Enterprise**

(spoiler series finale)

&gt;!At the end of the series, Trip dies. which in my opinion didn't really contribute any content to the series...!&lt;

**TNG** (spoiler around end season 1)

&gt;!around the end of season 1, Tasha Yar dies quite abruptly!&lt;

**VOY** (spoiler S4E2)

&gt;!Kes leaves and for some reason Voyager is launched a few years closer to home!&lt;

**DIS** (spoiler end S2, and to be honest a really big rant)

&gt;!Discovery season 3 greatly frustrated me because of the time travel to the future, first of all because it constrains (real-time) future star trek series by for example changing the name of Vulcan. Not to mention they overhauled the whole star trek ideology in that season  by creating a dystopian future where the federation is greatly limited (in contrast to for example TNG which starts writing stories from a utopian point of view). My frustration may be displaced because the series got removed from Netflix about a week before the release of season 4 and I live in a country where Paramount+ is not available.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**My point**

While I like to categorise ENT, TNG and VOY as great series inside the Star Trek universe, I find it weird that all of these series have a nasty 'quirk' like I mentioned in my examples.... so... do all great Star Trek Series have a 'quirk'? (I am scared for this possible 'quirk' inside DS9) 

Are there any more experienced Trekkies who could confirm/correct my theory?  
Thanks for reading this far.",startrek,Do all great Star Trek series have a nasty quirk?
1651264649,"I've been extremely disappointed in Discovery &amp; Picard. I had high hopes for both. IMHO, they are missing many of the storytelling components that I've loved about Star Trek over the decades. I know many fans enjoy these shows, and to them I say, IDIC.

I was cautiously optimistic about Lower Decks before it premiered. After the pilot episode, I felt like it was just a silly cartoon with a bunch of Star Trek references. But, as the first season progressed, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. The show has depth, character development, and it is very funny. After two full seasons of Lower Decks, I'm hooked and want more.

I did not have high expectations for Prodigy. I though it might be watchable but didn't expect to really get into it. I *really* did not like the two-part pilot and was afraid the entire show would be terrible. The next episode didn't impress me much either. But then, it kept getting better. By the mid-season break, I was shocked by how much I was enjoying the show. It successfully mixes a serialized storyline with strong standalone episodes and keeps building upon mysteries which are genuinely intriguing. I cannot wait to see the rest of the season.

1651258323,"- The episode title, ‚ÄúHide and Seek‚Äù, of course refers to the children‚Äôs game, which has been referenced many times across Trek, and is apparently cross-cultural, as Rom jokes, *‚ÄúNow you go hide and I‚Äôll search for you,‚Äù* in ‚ÄúThe Magnificent Ferengi‚Äù when Quark claims he‚Äôs been looking for Rom all over the station.

    - We actually see the game played in ‚ÄúFortunate Son‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrue Q‚Äù

    - Q‚Äôs second appearance was in the similarly titled, ‚ÄúHide and Q‚Äù, which actually has very little hiding, an adequate amount of Q, and more animal like soldiers dressed in 18th century French uniforms than you might expect.

- Queen Jurati dons the Borg Queen‚Äôs exo-skeleton, something we‚Äôve seen happen previously in ‚ÄúFirst Contact‚Äù. Of course, that iteration of the Queen appeared to only have meat bits from the shoulders up, and Jurati appears to still be mostly intact, more or less.

    - The brief shot of the Queen‚Äôs corpse after Jurati absorbs the exo-skeleton torso does appear to have been hollowed out.

- Tallinn‚Äôs weapons are a disruptor pistol, and a disruptor rifle, both Romulan make matching the ones the Tal Shiar death squads were using in season one.

- *‚ÄùSo myopically linear.‚Äù* The Borg Queen has a habit of deriding others for not have an expanded perspective, as established in ‚ÄúFirst Contact‚Äù.

- The *La Sirena* is able to create an Emergency Combat Hologram based on Elnor, despite the fact that Elnor was only alive on this Confederation iteration of *La Sirena* for only a few minutes at best before being killed.

    - The Emergency Elnor Hologram comes pre-equipped with a mobile emitter, which also seems to be a hologram? In the unaltered timeline, the mobile emitter was at least derived from the technology of a 29th century timeship, if not a product of the 29th century flat out. No indication of how the Confederation would have managed to develop identical technology.

- *‚ÄùThose aren‚Äôt people out there, they‚Äôre Borg.‚Äù* Add Seven of Nine, former Borg Drone, to the ever expanding list of people in Star Trek who need therapy, but clearly refuse to get help.

    - Seven‚Äôs sentiment does match Picard‚Äôs in ‚ÄúFirst Contact‚Äù: *‚ÄùYou may encounter Enterprise crewmembers who've already been assimilated. Don't hesitate to fire. Believe me you'll be doing them a favour.‚Äù*

- Young Picard has models of a Reliant-class starship, the Promellian battle cruiser in a bottle that was mentioned in ‚ÄúBooby Trap‚Äù and seen earlier this season in adult Picard‚Äôs study, and what appears to be a Columbia-class refit of the NX-class starship which was previously exclusive to beta canon.

- The ground combat with the Borged out ex-special forces goons does not seem particularly dangerous, though the threat of the Borg has never been their combat prowess as opposed to their ability to keep throwing drones at a situation and adapt.

- Seven reveals to Raffi that she attempted to join Starfleet after the *USS Voyager* returned to Federation space, but she was denied due to her status as a former Borg.

    - Janeway threatened to resign to get Starfleet to reconsider their stance, similar to Picard resigning to pressure Starfleet into continuing the Romulan rescue mission.

    - We know that Icheb did manage to become a Starfleet officer. Not only was he Borg for a shorter period of time than Seven, presumably Janeway advocated for him as well, even after Seven decided to go *‚ÄùFull ranger.‚Äù*

- The Emergency Elnor Hologram implies that he has some of Elnor‚Äôs last memories and emotions, but not all.

- Seven transports the Borg into the walks fo the catacombs beneath the Chate√°u Picard. In ‚ÄúStrange New World‚Äù we saw a member of the *NX-01* crew merged with rocks, leaves and other debris blowing around during a transport in a storm, and we saw a Starfleet officer embedded with a corridor floor in ‚ÄúIn Theory‚Äù, in a somewhat disturbing scene that may have stuck with some younger viewers at the time well into adulthood.

    - This does raise the question of whether or not the Borg are still stuck beneath the Chate√°u centuries later. Obviously we don‚Äôt see them in any of Jean-Luc‚Äôs flashbacks, but we know his explorations of these catacombs were limited. On the other hand, someone may have 

- *‚ÄúI‚Äôm proposing that what you‚Äôve written off as weakness is actually strength. Cooperation.‚Äù* Chakotay encountered a co-operative of former Borg in ‚ÄúUnity‚Äù. They briefly used him to re-establish their collective.

    - At the end of the episode, ‚ÄúTemporal Edict‚Äù, we were given a glimpse of a classroom at some unknown point in the future where Borg toddlers were learning about the history of Starfleet, along with humans, Ferengi, and Caitians.

- Queen Jurati reassimilates Seven to save her life, giving her‚Ä¶exactly the same implants as she had before? No indication of how much of Seven‚Äôs internal implants have reappeared, or the replacement eye seen in the alternate future of ‚ÄúTimeless‚Äù.

- Picard tells Tallinn he *‚Äúused to imagine seeing her, older, offering [him] a cup of tea.‚Äù* We saw one of those imaginations in ‚ÄúWhere No One Has Gone Before‚Äù.

- Young Picard‚Äôs tie has the same knot that he wore last season in ‚ÄúRemembrance‚Äù during the Federation News Network interview.

- *‚ÄúToo succeed there must be two Ren√©es, one who lives, and another who dies.‚Äù* Star Trek has many ways to create a duplicate of someone, including:

The new season of Picard, though? It started off so strong but the last two episodes have been awful. I see a lot of fan theories justifying how things happen, which is fine, but we shouldn't have to fill in these sloppy gaps from just legitimately awful writing. 

Deep breath:

\-How did Soong get a small army of mercenaries within 24 hours?  
\-Why did Soong accompany them on the mission when he isn't a combatant?  
\-Why do they have green lasers after being assimilated?  
\-How does Jurati-Queen assimilate someone's consciousness without Jurati having any visible upgrades / the Queen is just running around in her neuropathways? A human couldn't do a mind mild and this shouldn't work either  
\-Why the emphasis on action in almost every episode with guns and explosions? If this was true to TNG, the episode 9 would have been Picard and Q negotiating with the Jurati-Queen and it would have been a philosophical fight, not Seven and Raffi sprinting 50 yards with a corkscrew and somehow surviving 12 mercenaries with laser sights  


Q and Guinan are painfully underutilized. Introducing them and then not having them be in the majority of the show is worse than not having them at all. 

There are still some great character moments and fleshing out Picard's backstory is fine. The tragedy of his mother provides a ton of context about who he is as a person (and his vision in Season 1 of TNG where he sees his mother as an old woman). I actually like the idea that the Borg Queen, in isolation, could be persuaded to be less ruthless / better.

1651245517,"I'm watching ""Strange New Worlds: Inside the Series"" on Paramount+'s youtube channel... Producer Henry Myers is talking about Uhura and stated, ""With approaching Uhura, we felt it was really important to show a different perspective. And we had this unique opportunity to show an Uhura who is different from any Uhura that we'd seen before: Someone who is young, who is good at what she does, but not the assured future captain that she will eventually become.""

Add to that, in Picard Season 2, we see a reference to a ship that Uhura would eventually captain. Until that, I always assumed that Uhura retired at the rank of Commander after the events of STVI, but the placard that was made for Picard gives Uhura's career another *40 years.* Uhura's birth date was never firmly established, but the date that's been suggested implies she doesn't retire from the captain's seat until her mid-90's (for reference, Nichelle Nichols is currently 89 years old). It's almost like they wanted to leave the door open for Nichols to make a cameo appearance.

The placard shown in Picard states that Uhura got her own 5-year mission in 2301, and she participated in over 100 first contact missions during that time. Uhura remained in command of her ship when it became an Academy training vessel in 2317. Ten years later, Captain Uhura was still commanding when Cadet Jean-Luc Picard had his first faster-than-light experience.

I finished the TGN (for the second time) and I've never seen any other Star Trek. I enjoyed TGN immensly.

1651236740,"**TLDR; Picard and Q split the universe in two in order to prevent a paradox.**

Episode 10 airing on May 5th will close out season 2 of Star Trek Picard, and they will have to wrap up a lot of arcs. Here are my predictions for how the show will finish, and potentially set up the final season of Star Trek Picard.

Queen Aggie has flown off on the Confederation version of La Sirena to start her new 21st century ""Cooperative,"" but left Picard a tantalizing clue as to how the future could be saved. ""*The mission must not be postponed. To succeed, there must be two Ren√©es. One who lives and another who dies.*""

Q himself also left a clue in episode 2 ""Penance"" -- ""*Show them a world of their own making and they ask you what you've done.*"" If what Q is saying is true, Picard and his crew created the conditions that developed into the Confederation. Because we're dealing with time-travel, Picard and his crew **WILL** create those conditions, but haven't done it yet. 

A lot of things have already been set in motion and we're barreling towards a predestination paradox. In Penance, Q tells Picard he ""intervened"" during the explosion which destroyed the Stargazer. I propose that the predestination paradox began when the Borg ship emerged from the subspace rip. Here's where it gets tricky.

That borg ship in the 25th century belongs to Queen Aggie of the new Borg Cooperative. Behind that clockwork mask is the smiling face of Agnes Jurati. She survived from the 21st all the way to the 25th century, but she lived in a universe very different from Picard's own.

In her Universe, Ren√©e Picard died. She had to, because the Queen's lineage was that of a Borg who was nearly completely decimated by the Confederation. Her assimilated La Sirena came from the Confederation. In order for her own existence to be secured, the Confederation must exist. Adam Soong must be able to save the Earth, and Ren√©e Picard has to die.

But her existence also relies on Agnes Jurati and Jean-Luc Picard from the Federation. They too, must exist. The only way for the Federation to exist is for Ren√©e Picard to live and to succeed. So how can both seemingly contradictory events occur?

""*To succeed, there must be two Ren√©es. One who lives and another who dies.*""

""*Show them a world of their own making and they ask you what you've done.*""

Picard and crew will have to create a situation where their universe essentially splits. One where Ren√©e  makes it to Europa and the Federation evolves appropriately, and another where she dies and Soong becomes the savior of a xenophobic Earth; two Ren√©es. 

They lack the power and ability to split the entire universe into two independent versions. You know who does? Q. Sure, his power is failing, but maybe it's not completely failed. Q himself said, ""*Can a single act redeem a lifetime?*"" Q will summon nearly everything he has left to create a schism that will allow both universes to exist simultaneously. In one, Ren√©e will go on to succeed in her mission and the Federation will live on. In the other, Ren√©e dies and the Confederation also lives. 

Two Ren√©es, two universes, no paradox.

Queen Aggie, the physical embodiment of both universes, won't wink out of existence and will return, the long way, to the 25th century where she will set things in motion. How will Picard and crew return to the 25th century? Perhaps through Tallinn's technology? Maybe a final act of humanity from Q? It's a McGuffin either way. 

Season 3 begins with a seemingly restored Federation and everything is fine and dandy. Except the Confederation now exists and, having defeated a Galaxy's worth of foes, witnesses a Borg vessel rip through subspace into a ""neighboring"" universe.

1651202816,"I was surprised at how this wound up for me, especially at the top and middle of the list. Definitely didn't line up with my recollections:  


1. ***First Contact*** \-- This is an *incredible* film. The plot involves a ridiculous number of threads: the Borg, time travel, first contact, Data and the Borg Queen, Picard and Lily. But it manages to handle them all clearly so you always know what's going on. Jonathan Frakes' direction keeps the pace up so it doesn't collapse under its own weight. It shouldn't work, but it does in a way that reminded me of what *Infinity War* and *Endgame* will go on to do (in their own ways and arguably not as well). Features the best work by performers outside the main cast, with Alfre Woodard and Alice Krige's being the #1 and #2 best guest spots in a Trek film. Plus Adam Scott shows up for like five seconds.
2. ***The Voyage Home*** \-- On previous viewings, I liked, but never loved, this one. I thought the humor went too far. But I really liked the lighter tone and fun of it all this time. Though others have remarked on it going back to the first reviews, I also really appreciated for the first time how this film manages to create tension and stakes in spite of there being no villain.
3. ***The Undiscovered Country*** \-- A good, old fashioned political thriller / mystery story. Engaging, well-structured and fun. Christopher Plummer is having a great time chewing the scenery and quoting Shakespeare. A fitting send-off for the original cast.
4. ***The Wrath of Khan*** \-- This one fell lower in the rankings than I expected, though it's still quite good. On this rewatch, I was surprised at how cheaply made it feels, even by the standards of the time (and, indeed, it was). It tries and mostly succeeds at tackling big themes, but comes off more depressing and on one note than I remembered. Still, Khan is a great villain and the nebula battle / Genesis countdown / death of Spock sequence really holds up. Also has the best score of any film in the franchise.
5. ***Star Trek Beyond*** \-- The only one of the Kelvin timeline films that feels even remotely like Star Trek, and the only one that doesn't feel like a relentless assault on the senses. A fun, well-made popcorn flick.
6. ***The Motion Picture*** \-- Feels the most dated of any of the films (it is the oldest, after all) and could have used a polish on the script. But a true Star Trek story about pushing the boundaries of human experience. I watched the new 4K version of the Director's Cut, which is a substantial improvement in pacing and visual quality over the theatrical and earlier home media releases. Raises questions about what the franchise would have been if it had embraced this more stately, epic, 2001-esque style of this film.
7. ***The Final Frontier*** \-- Most people think this is the worst film of the franchise, or at least the worst with the original cast. It's certainly the most inconsequential with a silly plot and laughably bad special effects. Mediocre, but at least the cast look like they're having fun and somehow the movie managed to entertain me. Maybe I have a soft spot for campfire singalongs.
8. ***The Search for Spock*** \-- An even more somber tone than *TWoK* but without any of that film's redeeming qualities. Never quite hits its stride. Fell flat for me on this viewing in spite of many moments that should be affecting.
9. ***Generations*** \-- Picard is a wreck after a family tragedy. Data gets his emotion chip. Destruction of the *Enterprise*. The death of Kirk. But somehow the movie feels like less than the sum of these parts. Overall impression: it's trying too hard.
10. ***Insurrection*** \-- It does tell a Star Trek-y morality story. And the characters act consistently with their established characterizations, more so than in any of the other TNG films. But the stakes never feel high enough. The premise could have sustained a single episode, but not a film. Not offensive, but a forgettable snoozer.
11. ***Nemesis*** \-- It's interesting how this movie anticipates the worst trends in many different franchise reboots and revivals that will follow it. Plot points lifted from prior (and better) entries. Characters who behave in ways that conflict with their established characterizations (what's up, reckless dune buggy Picard?). Predictable, generally dour in tone and adds insult to injury with the death of a fascinating and beloved character.
12. ***Star Trek (2009)*** \-- Embodies everything we've come to know and dislike about JJ Abrams as a franchise filmmaker, and all the worst things about the recent incarnations of the Trek franchise. Add to that tons of ludicrous plot points and vertiginous, impossible to follow action sequences. For some reason everyone behaves like they're idiots. Completely misses (or more likely dismisses) the point of Star Trek and fails to substitute anything coherent in its place. Almost unwatchably bad.
13. ***Star Trek Into Darkness*** \-- Combines (and amplifies) all the things I dislike about *Nemesis* and *Star Trek (2009)*, except this time everyone behaves like *hateful* idiots. Seriously: why is every character -- including the heroes -- unnecessarily rude, obstinate, deceitful or sullen? This film and its predecessor make me despise every member of the main cast, all of whom I like, or even adore, in other things (except Anton Yelchin and Bruce Greenwood, who can't help but be endearing).

1651202683,"Okay, so look. I know how this is going to sound and I know what you're going to think I am. But this isn't that. I'm not one of those fans that's hyper obsessed with canon and thinks new Trek is somehow ""too woke"" (whatever that even means) or anything like that. I'm just a Trek fan. But *boy* am I at about my limit with these new shows. 

To this point, I've resisted criticizing Kurtzman Trek because it's young. Trek is a franchise that's always needed time to find its footing every time out. No one ever quite nails it right out of the gate. So I let it slide. I partook in the ""maybe next season they'll figure it out"" cycle. But I think it's finally time to just call this for what it is. 

The new crop of Trek writers are incapable of creating new, meaningful, relevant stories that have any point whatsoever. They all just meander and act like they have some deep insight about society but it never goes beyond ""things sometimes bad."" It's all hollow. It's a scam. 

I have never seen a franchise so dependent on fan service as this. They somehow both want to pretend like they're brave enough to buck canon while simultaneously relying on cheap flashes of it to keep viewers engaged. Every episode resorts to using some cheap musical cue for nostalgia or is some play on an iconic plotline or has some funny spin on classic dialogue. They have not managed to create a single lasting pop culture moment since their era of television began. 

For as big a budget as they give these shows, they have this kind of cheapness about them. And it's been bothering me trying to figure out what it is. But it's absolutely the writing. Characters just talk and talk and it's never about anything. It never even feels like real people talking. 

Nothing about these shows has felt like a real, tangible future that we can someday get to because it's all just window dressing for a sci-fi action show. They have no interest in fleshing out this future world and society and how people act in it. Every character from this new era, with maybe one or two exceptions, feels like a human being from today. It's *so* weird. 

It's like they forgot the point of making a show like Star Trek and are just going through the motions. It's weird to say but there's no sense of space in these shows. I've never gotten that sense that there's this great big universe out there with all these civilizations doing their own things and that they all matter. It somehow feels more planet-of-the-week than Trek ever has without even capturing the charm of that format. 

The visual language of the show is a hot mess. Things exist in this universe because they look cool. There's never any rhyme or reason to what technology they have because they don't want to think about it for more than 5 minutes. It creates this almost fantasy-like quality that totally removes that desire to attain a future like they're presenting. Everything is all dark and shiny and holographic and weirdly angular and it just looks messy. 

It all just looks really, really bleak right now. I can't imagine that these's some switch they flip and suddenly it all gets better. The writing pedigree of these people does not inspire tremendous confidence. I think more than anything, I just want them to know that. I want them to know that I was that fan that was onboard with a new, bold take on Trek and that they have utterly failed me. There's nothing brave about what they're doing. It's cheap and hollow and I'm done with it.

A show about the Legion wandering in the Delta Quadrant building their collective over 400 years would actually be quite interesting.

Before you think that a Borg redemption arc is stupid, hear me out.

Trek had rarely explored what a hivemind really is, except episodes like Unimatrix Zero, in which we saw how some individual minds in the Collective could still communicate through dreams. Picard S2 has been interesting in that aspect in the way that we could see how it actually works in the struggle between Jurati and the Queen.

Imagine in the beginning it's just Jurati and the old Queen on La Sirena trying to flesh out who they should assimilate. They will be truly bootstrapped like Voyager, except it's an army of one instead of a crew complement of 152. They cannot assimilate in mass anymore, but instead, each new recruit needs to be vetted. And as the collective grows, each of them would still have their individuality, so they can all talk to each other, yet also access each others' skills and control each others' bodies.  
(Oh wait, I just described Sense8 in Voyager.)

As they don't have abundant power, they will need to carry out high stakes alien heists to get what they need. They may attempt to steal warp cores. Or salvage destroyed ships in the trail of the Borg. And they may attempt to assimilate a Doomsday Machine for power (which was what the designer of the Borg ship suggested). And of course they also need to hide under the radar from the Borg. They might even get captured by the Borg but they would manage to liberate a few drones from Unimatrix Zero.

(So I guess that is Sense8 in Voyager in the Matrix.)

We will also get to see empires being expanded over the decades and century - a traversal of time periods we had not seen in the Trek series. The writers can do as many time skips as they like. Each season can be an entirely new time period. The crew may be able to observe early Federation from afar (and may even be able to assist old Archer). And they can travel across timelines and escape from time cops. We can also see what it's like to have a crew of one, a crew of 8, a crew of hundreds, to a collective of thousands, and millions.",startrek,A show or a novel about the Legion would actually be quite cool.

1651190419,"Jean-Luc Picard has been through more mental stress in his lifetime than I can fathom. He has traveled time repeatedly, lived an entire lifetime as another person, lived in a time loop (for a few weeks if I recall correctly), jumped between time periods at an increasingly frantic rate, been trapped inside a holodeck without realizing it, been reverted to a child, re-lived his 20's, merged with a collective consciousness (then un-merged), and I'm sure I'm missing other things.

1651187522,"I grew up on Star Wars. The only Star Trek related thing I saw until 2009 was Galaxy Quest (I know not officially Star Trek but I did my research on how you all love it.) Then the Kelvin timeline crew became my first introduction to the franchise and I saw all of those in theaters. That was about the extent of it because after all, I grew on Star Wars. Admittedly I didn't start watching anything else until late 2021 after rewatching JJ's stuff again. Suddenly I wanted to know more about Kirk and Spock. The idea of Starfleet intrigued me. 

I decided to go in chronological order starting with ENT and ending with VOY (including all movies). My goal was to finish before SNW drops. Wow. What an incredible experience. I've been seeing other people on this sub mention them going through everything for the first and couldn't wait to share my experience. I learned a few things. First, ENT is awesome. I wish they would have had 7 seasons, it was just getting good and I loved the idea of the first Captain figuring things out as he went along. Second, I didn't think I'd like TNG because I genuinely loved the classic Kirk/Spock dynamic but TNG ended up being one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. DS9 was ahead of its time and had some of the best episodes of the franchise IMO. VOY had the coolest premise and I connected emotionally with the simple story of just trying to make it home. 

Despite all of that my favorite crew is still the Kelvin Enterpise crew. It's hard to forget your first contact. But as for favorite show it's between TNG and ENT. I say ENT because it was the first show I started and the theme song really slapped. Currently I catching up on Picard before Season 3 and then I need to finish seasons 3 and 4 of DISCO. Fan for life. I'm just really sorry I waited so long to be assimilated üòâ

Thanks if you've read this far. I think this is one of my first posts on Reddit. Hope I did it right. 

TLDR: Resistance is futile. Watch Star Trek or be destroyed. Decided to watch everything in chronological for my first time experiencing the franchise as a whole. Fav crew: Kelvin Enterpise (twas my first contact). Fav show: TNG or ENT. *Bonus* fav movie: toss up between TMP Directors Cut, First Contact or Star Trek 2009.",startrek,Can't believe I held out for so long.
1651184735,"The original broadcast of ""The Measure of a Man"" was 44 minutes, like all TV of the era, with space for 16 minutes of commercials.

Sometime later, an ""extended edition"" of the episode was found in the possession of writer Melissa Snodgrass, which was later released in 2012 (including on Blu-ray). This version is 57 minutes long; 13 more minutes than the broadcast cut.

What I'm wondering is -- why does this even exist? It's not unusual to film a little extra for TV and then trim for time, but 13 whole minutes? Entire additional scenes exist in the EE that are not in the broadcast version. TV is expensive, and TNG was an exceptionally expensive show, so why would the creators even make this thing?

The only thing I can think of is that it was intended to be ""a very special episode"" of TNG and be broadcast over a 90 minute timeslot (which would seem appropriate for a 57 minute episode) -  but for some reason that didn't pan out so they had to cut it down to the standard 44 minutes. But I haven't seen any source to back this up; it's pure speculation on my part.

I never liked Kate Mulgrew. There was, and is, something about her persona, and even her voice, that just sets my teeth on edge. It's hard to give a show a chance, if you don't like the lead actor or actress. In contrast, I liked *everyone* on DS9. 

I thought the characters were photocopies of photocopies. Thin little characters punched out of a slot, with stock ""features"" to make each one seem different. Compared to *Voyager*, even the animated characters on *Lower Decks* are dazzling in their complexity. In comparison, nearly everyone on TNG and DS9 were developed in interesting ways.

I thought the show kept introducing interesting ideas, then almost immediately dropping them. A Starfleet crew forced to team up with a rebelling faction, in order to survive and get home? Cool!

I had a moment when the Voyager made first contact with Neelix where I thought ""how are their hailing technologies even compatible?""

The more I think about it, I guess this would also be a consideration for contacting new species in the alpha and beta quadrants, and in DS9 the heroes were able to interface with Dominion technology.

In order to force Data's cooperation, he is even wiling to kill his own people.  Right before Data's escape, Fajo taunts him to shoot him citing that he cannot due to Data being unable to cause harm to another living being.

There is a moment where Data clearly and concisely considers the proposition and then he says he must put a stop to this.  He pulls the trigger like a stone cold MFer and was definitely going to kill Fajo.  But right at that moment, Obrien beams him off Fajo's ship and is spared.  Obrien comments that there is a weapon in the transport that was discharged and that he is deactivating it.

Now, Data even said himself that although he cannot purposefully harm another living being, he is very capable of employing deadly force if it is in the defense of life.  So I understand exceptions can be made, and that he decided that offing Fajo would be deadly force employed in the preservation of life since Fajo clearly had no qualms about killing even those loyal to him.

But Obrien and Riker question him on this and this is what got me as I re-watched this today...  Data straight up lied and suggests that something must have occurred during transport.  Now that could be, but I damn well believe he pulled that trigger on purpose and then deflected this fact when he arrived on the Enterprise.

1651086770,"Star Trek Enterprise was the best Star Trek series was the conclusion I came to. Here is why, and hear me out before you judge!

‚Ä¢It paid so much homage to TOS. From the sounds of the ship, to bringing up tribbles, to archer fighting like Kirk would, and obvious in a mirror darkly part 1&amp;2 in season 4.
‚Ä¢TNG didn‚Äôt get good until season 3. Neither did enterprise some say. But TNG got a fair shake, enterprise didn‚Äôt.
‚Ä¢Archers character arc. 
When the series first started, there were questions as to why a ship would even need weapons. Archer was a happy go lucky explorer in season 1, but by season 4, had become battle hardened, and had seen so much. We see a man get torn down, and the idea of exploration gets soured by constant threats.
 ‚Ä¢Archers crew didn‚Äôt have the resources that future captains had. Going into the unknown, in the dark, was truly something in this show. There was no prime directive, no real guidelines, and little assistance if anything. Just look at season 3 with the expanse. There was little data for anything, not a lot of ships to even assist. NX-01 wasn‚Äôt a battle ship, but it sure as hell got treated like one. 
‚Ä¢The main cast as a whole was amazing. It worked extremely well.
‚Ä¢Archer had a different captain style. We saw the crew of enterprise get their asses kicked, but we also saw them succeed just as much. Archer did a damn good job as captain. Especially in season 4. He wasn‚Äôt so ‚Äúofficial‚Äù. He had a more relaxed way of leading, and letting those on the crew do what they do best. Of course archer had to be tougher on occasion. But if I had to choose as my captain. It would either be Archer, or Kirk. 
‚Ä¢The show gave us answers to questions we had. Such as how the Vulcans came to be in the other show that take place later. Or why the Klingons looked more human like in TOS.
‚Ä¢There we‚Äôre episodes that threw what was right, or wrong in your face. If you‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúcogenitor‚Äù episode you know what I mean. Think about a time when there was no prime directive. How do they manage. Watch the ‚Äúcogenitor‚Äù episode. 

I could go on! I love every Star Trek series, from TOS to Star Trek Picard(season 2 is better than 1). I don‚Äôt like discovery though. Not trying to offend discovery fans.

Resistance is Futile

1. tlhIngan Hol only permits syllables to end in a single consonant, or in one of three consonant clusters, those being -w', -y', and -rgh. I figure ""borgh"" fit best, but if you speak a non-rhotic accent (one where Rs after vowels aren't pronounced), then you might find ""boq"" fits better  

2. Technically, porghQeD is biology/anatomy, as in ""body science."" I thought perhaps ""porgh mIw,"" ""body function"" worked better in this context. SIr is a verb that means ""be unique"" that is acting as an adjective here. 

3. 'om - resist (ohm, hehe), -lu' - unspecified subject ('omlu' - someone resists), -ghach - nominalizer (hopefully, 'omlu'ghach would be ""resistance"". qey - futile/be in vain. The prefix for a 3rd person singular subject (resistance) without an object is no prefix (or a null prefix, rather), so technically an accurate translation might be like, ""Someone resisting is futile."" Could phrase it like *'omlu'DI' reH qey*, ""When someone resists, it is always futile."" 

Maybe they'd add one of the suffixes that mean they're sure of it or they think it's obvious, like *qey 'omlu'bejghach'* or *'omlu'Di' reH qeyba'*, ""Someone resisting is definitely futile,"" ""When someone resists, it is obviously futile.""",startrek,I tried to translate the Borg hail to Klingon.

1650900873,"I feel like Discovery tried very much to take on trek and tell it in a different way that was experimental than the shows before. The first season visually and narratively took risks that I felt made it more interesting. A dysfunctional ship with different character archetypes really made it more interesting because you were invested in the relationship Michael had with others. When Lorca was founded out to be from the mirror universe and Saru was active captain the show became more vibrant as the ship became more functional. Building the world of old Trek in a newer way helped bring so much that I wondered how can they tell old concepts and play with it? Then season two came along and even built upon even more older concepts and played with it in newer ways such as bringing in Captain Pike which arguably was the best part of the season and having a concept of exploration in different parts of the universe that explained many different elements of the season long arc. But around season three the entire show for me took a left turn as the show went 1000 years into the future and basically in a broken galaxy where the federation was almost no more. The concept for the season was great but the character archetypes in place from the first season was flipped on its head. For example Saru became this incompetent captain when we have seen before he was able to navigate through a totalitarian universe. Tilly became a new first in command after she has been shown to be someone who had issues with her own self esteem and was on a journey from being a cadet to this. Then other characters such as culber, staments, and even the support bridge cast members were all trying to be this sort of traditional trek in a t.v landscape where it barely survived. The show really seemed like it was trying to please the nay sayers who claimed this wasn't trek even though this show to me didn't need to be traditional  trek in order to be good. Around the fourth season the show had another interesting concept of dealing with a force that wasn't understood until the end of the season but even still the character archetypes that was flipped on its head in the third season didn't help much and the season felt more dragged out even though it was shorter than the first two seasons. The show in the later half feels like its being more so like a traditional trek show with a story structure that won't allow it. 

I feel as if trying to tell old concepts, in a new landscape, while presenting it in an old fashion way is making Discovery for me less interesting, and to top it off taking out the character archetypes that made the show interesting even makes it less fruitful and genuine than it was before. Even though we aren't in the old episodic days of 90s trek one thing is for certain with all trek shows is that the characters make is worthwhile. TNG wouldn't be TNG without the drama story lines with is characters, Voyager became more interesting when Seven of Nine came on and her relation to the crew made them more interesting. The characters in ENT became more 3D when they were forced to be put to the test that challenged the traditional trek formula. In this new streaming landscaping it is vital to try and make each season as experimental as it can possible be. I don't want NuTrek to resemble old trek I want it be more as there is freedom now to do more with it.",startrek,I think Discovery's First Two Seasons Was Its Best
1650899880,"To me, ‚ÄúWaltz‚Äù is a great episode that shows how power can really bring out the worst in people. In this case, Gul Dukat and his power-complex.

Dukat was put in a power through a corrupt, evil system to order to control a group of people (the Bajorans). He was desperate for their approval and tried to make a bad situation better (gilding a cage). Thinking of himself as a god-like figure with the Bajorans interests at heart, Dukat was convinced he was doing them a favor. He craved their praise and respect. Instead, the Bajorans spat in his face and he couldn‚Äôt understand why. Because of this, Dukat began to secretly loathe the Bajorans, but could never come to terms with this hate. 

Dukat would bottle these feelings for years while still convincing himself he was in the right. He hoped one day he would come across someone that would approve of him. After regaining and losing control of the Bajorans for a second time, as well as his daughter, Dukat had to face his demons (literally) in ‚ÄúWaltz‚Äù. 

While both marooned, Dukat pleaded for Sisko, a non-corrupt individual in a position of power that is worshipped by the Bajorans, for his input on him. He was desperate for Sisko‚Äôs approval, despite being allied with the Dominion and his past actions, to the point of holding Sisko hostage. When Sisko finally allowed him to present his case, Dukat admitted he believed the Bajorans were confused ingrates he grew to hate. Doing so, Dukat finally realized no one who opposed him would ever respect him. He escapes with the intentions of ‚Äúdestroying Bajor‚Äù, coming to terms with his demons and solidifying Sisko‚Äôs judgement that Dukat was truly evil.

Overall, Dukat‚Äôs ego and actions are not unlike corrupt politicians, authority figures, or even that one manager you had when you worked at the local grocery store. Someone who believes they have your interests at heart, but will go as far as literally destroying you if you don‚Äôt approve. That‚Äôs what a power-complex can do to someone.

I know it may sound like a terrible idea, but you could explore the Andromeda Galaxy with the Kelvan Empire (despite the fact that the place will die in 10,000 years supposedly from radiation, but only for their species) and what if the Empire finally collapsed. You could tie in the Iconians somehow with other things. You could also make it a New Frontier-style show with Calhoun dealing with the destruction and fall of an empire and they go around exploring the aftermath of it, and maybe that's how you finally make him canon. I'm just spitballing here, but I'm curious on how other people who set this up. You can tie in a lot of unresolved cliffhangers from all of Trek, such as the Planet Killers, V'Yger, the aliens from Schisms, the whale probe and so much more.",startrek,How would you pitch a Star Trek show set in another galaxy?
1650855053,"I just finished the first ""Picard"" novel, ""The Last Best Hope"" and...thought it was pretty great, actually. Great enough that I thought I would write a ""book report"" summarizing the things I learned. This is just a summary of things I found insightful or interesting, and I highly recommend reading the entire thing to see what I left out.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Romulan Supernova**

The thing I'm most grateful for is the way the novel was able to emphasize the sheer scope of the disaster, and the subsequent evacuations. Starfleet first becomes aware that the Romulan star is going to explode in 2381, six years before it happens. At that time, they estimate that the radius of the blast will be 9.7 light-years. In time, they refine their modeling, and realize that the supernova will expand much more quickly than they had realized, and the blast radius will be far larger, affecting far more worlds than orginally anticipated (more on this later).

It's suggested more than once in the novel that the supernova is unnatural, and may have been manufactured or caused deliberately, perhaps in an attack, but no significant progress is made toward uncovering who or what may have caused it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Mission**

The Romulan government is extremely reluctant to accept Starfleet's help - this is generally attributed to the secrecy of Romulan culture, and a desire to save face amongst the Romulan officials. Initially, they agree to allow Starfleet access to some of their outlying systems (that are within the blast radius) to relocate the inhabitants to safe worlds in Romulan space. Access to the core Romulan worlds is flatly denied. Even this relatively small-scale operation is estimated to involve the relocation of 900 million Romulans, and require thousands of ships, personnel, and ground infrastructure to resettle the refugees. It will become Starfleet's core mission for at least the better part of a decade, and virtually all exploration grinds to a halt as ships and resources are diverted to the evacuation efforts.

And that's all before the revised modeling reveals that the radius will be larger than they had realized, and that worlds they had previously regarded as safe destinations also need to be evacuated.

Overall, the book emphasizes the magnitude of the operation very effectively. This evacuation is now Starfleet's primary mission. Civilian researchers like Bruce Maddox are pulled from their careers and re-deployed to assist. It's truly an all-encompassing endeavour.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jean-Luc Picard**

Picard is hand-picked by Starfleet and promoted to lead this mission - however, one of the conditions is that he must do it without the *Enterprise,* as the Starfleet flagship wouldn't exactly be a welcome sight from a Romulan point of view. Picard hand-picks Worf to replace him as captain of the Enterprise, arguing against Kirsten Clancy's objections - she was citing Worf's actions in ""Change of Heart"", and Picard argues that his record since then has been spotless. Picard never returns to the *Enterprise*, and his belongings are shipped to him.

Obviously, Picard is the primary focus of the novel, and he's consistently portrayed as driven to save as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible. He devotes everything he has to his mission, and is completely unconcerned with the politics of what he's trying to achieve. This comes to a head when the revised modelling comes out, and Picard makes the decision to transport some refugees across the Neutral Zone to a Federation world that's willing to take them in, essentially unilaterally destroying the Neutral Zone.

His single-mindedness is his greatest virtue in the novel, and it's probably his greatest flaw as well, as he is ultimately blindsided by the changing political climate in Federation space, choosing instead to focus on his mission.

&amp;#x200B;

**Geordi La Forge**

As the only member of the *Enterprise* crew requisitioned by Picard for the mission, Geordi is a relatively minor character. He's placed in charge of the shipbuilding operations on Utopia Planitia. For the most part, we see him dealing with the resentment of people who have been pulled away from their careers to build the refugee ships, get them on-board with the mission and sort out the many, many logistical problems. The most significant issue is labour, which is eventually solved when Geordi contacts Bruce Maddox.

When the attack on Mars eventually happens, Geordi is on a shuttle en route to Earth, so he's safe (albeit dealing with significant survivor's guilt).

&amp;#x200B;

**Raffi Musiker**

When we meet her, Raffi is a Starfleet intelligence specialist in Romulan Affairs. She provides Picard with a briefing, and he's impressed by her frankness and honesty, in addition to her expertise on the Romulans. He quickly invites her to be his First Officer aboard his new ship, the *Verity*. As Raffi spends the next several years continuously aboard the *Verity*, we see her relationship with her husband and son deteriorate, while at the same time she bears witness to the horrors of millions of Romulans living in despair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bruce Maddox**

Maddox is recruited by La Forge to solve the labour issues on Mars. Maddox is furious to be pulled away from his life's work, but really has no choice but to develop synthetic workers as requested. He resents every second of it, however, and when Jurati gives him the idea of fractal neuronic cloning, he begins to devote his time to that, neglecting the A500 synths (which are already in full production by that point, so the fact that he's pretty checked-out goes unnoticed). When the synths eventually ""revolt"", Maddox freaks out a bit, unable to say definitively what had happened. His program at the Daystrom Institute is shut down, he leaves Earth, and we know the rest. Maddox is a jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

**The A500 Synths**

Not too much to say here, other than that the book is extremely emphatic that the A500s are not sentient, and are not programmed to have the ability to gain sentience. Maddox has utter contempt for them, referring to them more than once as ""toys."" The biggest technological leap they exhibit is that they combine Maddox's existing android reasearch with bio-neural technology for the first time. This greatly improves the synths' ability to learn to complete tasks, but - and believe me when I say the book can't emphasize this enough - they are not sentient.

&amp;#x200B;

**Agnes Jurati**

Jurati is a medical doctor when she joins Maddox at the Daystrom Institute - she's there on some kind of secondment as part of an interdisciplinary program. She's extremely interested in Maddox's research, and...okay, their icky relationship is what it is at this point. Jurati mostly serves as a distraction for Maddox, encouraging him to keep working on his dream of sentient androids, and giving him the idea of fractal neuronic cloning. After the attack on Mars, Agnes declines to leave Earth with him, and he doesn't really stick around long enough for her to give a good explanation as to why.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kirsten Clancy**

Captain Clancy is brought on to the evacuation project even before Picard is - she portrayed as a somewhat steely personality, with an immaculate record. Her role ends up being coordinating with both Romulan officials and the Federation Council to shore up an maintain political support for the evacuations - all the stuff that Picard ignores. She has a somewhat different view of things - some would say cynical, others might say realistic - but she fully supports the mission throughout. However, she doesn't quite share the ""whatever it takes"" mentality as Picard - her view of the situation is quite different from his. She doesn't receive her own promotion to Admiral until the novel's post-script, said to be a couple of years after the attack on Mars and abandonment of the project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Olivia Quest**

A junior Council member from the world of Estelen, Quest is the novel's primary stand-in for the voice of dissastisfaction in the Federation. Estelen is a small Federation world near the Neutral Zone - by all accounts, it's a bit of an unremarkable backwater, and Quest feels pretty strongly that her world, and others like it, are suffering as a result of the evacuation operations. And to an extent, she's right - worlds like hers feel overlooked by the ""Big Four"" founding worlds at the best of times, and they are in fact losing out on planned equipment requisitions and infrastructure projects as resources are redeployed to support the evacuation. She's also an admittedly ambitious politician - she quickly makes a splash in the media and positions herself front-and-centre on committees pertaining to the evacuation project. It should be noted that she never actually comes out against the mission itself, though she does argue that its scope is too large to be sustainable. She also does not support seccession, and is somewhat aghast when other worlds are considering it. There is also one aspect of the evacuation project that she's incredibly enthusiastic about, as she can see a clear future benefit for her world - the A500 synths.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spock**

Spock is mentioned twice. Initially, Picard ponders having Spock speak to the Romulan Senate to urge them to cooperate with Starfleet, only to be reminded that the Romulan Senate doesn't exactly hold Spock in the same esteem that Picard does. Years later, Picard speaks to Spock, who had remained in Romulan space for as long as possible, but is finally taking his own people to safety. There's no mention of his eventual plan to collapse the supernova, which is unsurprising as it's still two years away at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vashti**

Vashti is the world settled by the Qowat Milat - a Federation world that welcomed the Romulan refugees with open arms, it is set up to be the single greatest success story of the evacuation. Picard relies heavily on the world to boost his own morale when things get difficult, and it also serves as a valuable propaganda tool, as a model of Federation and Romulan citizens coexisting peacefully. The novel ends before things take a turn for the worse on Vashti, but the novel really contextualizes Picard's anger at the state of affairs he finds when he returns in ""Absolute Candor.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Nimbus III**

The Planet of Galactic Peace stands as a contrast to Vashti - Picard and the *Verity* arrive to evacuate the populace, but the independent-minded residents initially refuse. Then the Tal Shiar arrive and take over the operation - Picard feels he has no jurisdiction to argue, and withdraws his Starfleet forces. Leaked footage of the mass executions conducted by the Tal Shiar eventually finds its way to him.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Attack on Mars and the Aftermath**

This event pretty much closes out the novel. Information on exactly what happened is scarce, but the popular belief is that the A500 synths somehow gained sentience and revolted. Maddox is too scatterbrained to be able to say definitely they didn't, Picard is prepared to take this explanation at face value (his attitude toward this is one of my few issues with the novel), and it seems only Raffi suspects that there may be a greater plot at work. Picard is ordered to return to Earth, and he does so, armed with a revised plan of how to redeploy what ships Starfleet has available to continue the evacuation, and fully expecting to get his way. He's completely unprepared to find out that what little remaining support for the evacuation has completely evapourated - he offers his resignation (even he is uncertain as to whether he had intended this as a gamble, or whether he knew deep-down that it was over). Either way, his resignation is accepted, the evacuation efforts are over, and Raffi is left high and dry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's my summary of the things that I found interesting in the novel - again, I would highly encourage anyone who's interested in the story of the evacuation to check it out. Overall, I thought it was a pretty great read.

Here's the thing ...

Before transporting from the crashed ship into the world of past Earth, they made a dire warning that any sort of upset from or change to the past would be catastrophic. Then they proceed to follow through on this by centering a drama of an episode about getting Rios from the medical center.

But when they arrive, after tracing the badge, they just look around and leave. Their concern for all the ways Rios could upset the timeline simply fell away even though they literally traced the badge to the place ... because ... they are *sorta* worried about him and forgot they just used the advanced future tech? This would almost keep things moving, but then as if to remind us how stupid our heroes are they even take the time to focus on the badge. The one they just traced there with the tools that give them the ability to retrieve it and eliminate that concern.

But we don't return to it until a couple episodes later, when we finally see Rios reunited with the badge and using it.

So I am confused.

By narratively focusing on the badge and then throwing it away, in your opinion were the writers/directors:

1. Designing the episode to communicate that our heroes are dumber than the viewers? (For example, it's high brow writing to emulate the traumas our heroes are experiencing from their stressful situation, and therefore an explanation for how they lost track of the heavy threat of negative butterfly effects?)

2. Using typical concern tropes to hook people to the next episodes with no actual reward for the concerns or questions they raised ... (something that *Star Trek: Picard* has been generally criticized for)?

3. Actually ***unaware*** that using derivative stylings in your storytelling creates the effect that the season arcs are disjointed and/or ""phoned in""?

4. Something we will have to wait for the last episode to resolve?

5. Something else?

1650658834,"I've really enjoyed season 2 of Picard and wanted to share a few thoughts on the most recent episodes. Obviously this contains some spoilers.

Q is dying and is in search of a legacy, a causa sui project that will survive him. That's his plan. He wants humanity to transcend, possibly to someday replace and improve the dying continuum. But there's a problem with humanity, an obstacle preventing them from evolving, something that has them ""stuck"". Q is using this particular human, Picard, in order expose the problem and ""un-stick"" the species by showing him how to un-stick himself. From a perspective of time as long as the Q, it matters very little whether humanity destroys itself early or destroys itself in 1000 years, so the consequence of the timeline changes mean very little to him if he isn't able to get Picard to ""see"" the root of the problem.   


Each thread of this story: Agnes vs. the Borg Queen, Picard vs. his repressed memories, and Soong vs. Self all point to different aspects of the same theme, that there exists an unrecognized shadow or darkness inside all of us. Unless that darkness is recognized and not denied, given power to rise into consciousness and be seen, it threatens to lash out and take over in unpredictable ways. By denying the existence of our id, we stand in danger of becoming our id in the same way that Soong's death fear leads to the Confederation, Agnes' arrogance that she can control the Borg Queen leads to her possession, and Picard's refusal to accept his own pain and ""barbarity"" (reference the trial from Encounter at Farpoint where Picard angrily denied humanity's continued barbarism) prevents him from forming close connections and leads to his isolation. Taken together, these three outcomes form the ultimate fate of the species: Projection of the death fear onto others and coping through domination, unrestrained narcissism in the assimilation of the world, and ultimately dying alone. The failure of humanity to collectively recognize the inner monster damns its ascension. This is possibly the very thing which damned the continuum. That is the problem with the Federation, Section 31, all of it. As long as they falsely believe themselves to be above and beyond their collective darkness, their actions are continually guided by the unseen, unrecognized hand of base animality.  


Each of these can be discussed in detail, but I promised myself not to write book this afternoon.   


Why does Agnes lose control of her body? She becomes flooded with endorphins after putting on a pretty dress and singing to the praise and applause of a crowd. It caused that sort of response because she harbored an unconscious need to be seen and loved. It wasn't the existence of that need which lead to her undoing, but the fact it wasn't known and recognized. The Borg Queen harbored the same need, the primary difference being that unlike Agnes the Queen knew what she wanted and consciously moved toward that end. Absent that knowledge, Agnes was reduced to a puppet. If Agnes ends up being the Borg Queen from the first episode, the line about wanting peace but first needing power is profound. Our shadows are denied power and are repressed, for a time. The slow pressure, rising power, of that suppressed self is what eventually allows it to rise into consciousness. The stronger the block, or the more powerful devastation when the dam finally breaks.   


Why is Adam Soong in such constant agony, willing to break laws, kill people, and sever every connection to humanity even his own daughter? He is possessed by the fact that he will die, and without a legacy, will leave nothing. He is possessed by the fear of annihilation, something I expect he shares with Q. This death fear, a need for immortality, leads him to choose his personal glory over the destruction of the world. His central question becomes, ""What use is a good world if I'm not in it?"" The Confederation which rises in Soong's image is similarly obsessed, wiping out all things not human as if they were inherently existential threats, building legacy through personal domination and will. As Soong pronounced, anyone can procreate (animals), but he created life through sheer will. He wills his immortality into existence in defiance and denial of his nature.   


Why was Picard unable to form a relationship with Laris? He was afraid that inside himself he was the monster he believed his father to be, one who symbolically ""killed"" his mother. He feared loving Laris and becoming his father. This is the one symbol that seems most tied to the continuum. In the face of Picard's fear, he does nothing. Instead of engaging this fear directly, he distracts himself with a constant barrage of adventures and responsibilities. The problem is not that Picard is constantly active, it's the reason that he's active, it's a denial mechanism. It's not the trap that's important, but the escape. How can humanity ever transcend itself if it is constantly busying itself with denial activities?   


Anyway, I think it's a great show, really thought provoking. I'm looking forward to how they wrap this up. My best guess is that Agnes and the Queen form an alliance that's agreeable to them both, part of which is peace with the Federation. I think Picard realizes his fears and finds Laris. Soong, who represents the road not taken, will be defeated.",startrek,"Picard, Q, and the fear of death"

  I'm around 150 pages from the end of the 3rd book of the Star Trek Coda trilogy and I really can't help but question whether or not our Next Generation cannon universe would survive the Devidians.

   
  **First, what did Q do?** 

  
  Q told Jean-Luc that he was putting humanity on trial. Jean-Luc knew from then on that his every action was being judged and this encouraged Jean-Luc to be more diplomatic and open-minded. To mold him into the type of person who would make the right choices to ensure that he could be there to save the universe when the time came.

  
  **Why did Q do it?** 

  
  The Q continuum had been lame and boring for so many years, right? Existence would have been even less bearable for an immortal if all of the universes were munched up by the Devidians, right? 

  
  **How did this effect history?** 

  
  Picard and friends would have failed to stop the Devidians. They might have even failed the first time that they came into contact with them. Maybe Jean-Luc never even meets Guinan. 

  
  Maybe humanity doesn't meet the Borg until it's too late. 

  
  Maybe there is no civil war in the Q continuum. Maybe they're still just sitting around doing nothing. Isn't it possible that Q made life exciting for the continuum again because fate didn't turn out the way they knew it would? 

  
  Everyone in the continuum knew that the universe was going to come to an end and there's be nothing worth watching and nobody worth bothering because in the end they were not going to exist anymore... until Q changed everything. 

  
  Maybe Jean-Luc isn't so forgiving about how the traveler threw the Enterprise off course and maybe he doesn't encourage Westley as the traveler instructed Picard to do.   

  
  If Westley isn't a traveler, Jean-Luc and friends have absolutely no idea what's going on duing the Coda trilogyand 100% of Star Fleet just sticks their head in the sand when the universe begins coming undone and goodbye, thanks for the fish to our entire timeline!

1650632898,"- The episode opens to a flashback of a young boy, whom we‚Äôll learn is FBI Agent Wells, rushing through the woods and encountering a Vulcan. Prior to the official first contact in ‚ÄúFirst Contact‚Äù, we‚Äôre away of multiple incidents of Vulcans on Earth.

    - Spock visited Earth in ‚ÄúThe City on the Edge of Forever‚Äù after travelling through Carl to 1930, and was instrumental in seeing to it that Kirk allowed a the owner of a soup kitchen to die.

    - In ‚ÄúCarbon Creek‚Äù, T‚ÄôPol tells the story of an ancestor, T‚ÄôMir, whose scout ship crash landed outside the titular town while investigating the Sputnik satellite in 1957. T‚ÄôMir, Mestral, and Stron spent nearly a year pretending to be human and living in Pennsylvania before being rescued in 1958. Mestral choose to remain on Earth, and T‚ÄôMir reported him as officially having perished in the crash.

    - In ‚ÄúAssignment: Earth‚Äù the Enterprise travelled to 1967, just to check it out, and Spock traveled to the planet with Kirk to bumble around a bit while Gary Seven attempted to back door pilot his way into a series.

        - Of note, before acquiescing to let Mestral remain on Earth, T‚ÄôMir did say she could attempt for him to return on the next survey mission, which would have been 20 years later 1978, and was intended to only do scans from high orbit.

    - In 1986, Spock travels to Earth‚Äôs history again in ‚ÄúThe Voyage Home‚Äù to rescue some humpback whales, so that they in turn and rescue Earth in 2286.

    - In ‚ÄúFuture‚Äôs End‚Äù Tuvok is part of the away mission to Los Angeles in 1996, where he gets to prevent Tom Paris from spending any alone time with Rain Robinson, and blew up a semi-truck with his phaser. His official log described the mission as, ‚ÄúMost agreeable.‚Äù

    - ‚ÄúCarpenter Street‚Äù has T‚ÄôPol visit Eart in 2004 along with Archer, to stop a Xindi-Reptillian plot.

- Kore dons a set of goggles she refers to as *‚ÄùAspectus‚Äù* which generates a holographic simulation of her father‚Äôs laboratory. Obviously a long way off from a holodeck, but we‚Äôve seen devices which create single user experiences before, such as Captain Ransom‚Äôs synaptic simulator from ‚ÄúEquinox‚Äù, or the device Stamets was using to rewatch a message from Hugh Culber in ‚ÄúBrother‚Äù.

- *‚ÄùAm I--am I an experiment‚Äù* Kore appears to have forgotten her own discovery just two episodes ago.

- Kore‚Äôs table has three books on it: ‚ÄúMoby Dick‚Äù by Herman Melville, John Milton‚Äôs ‚ÄúParadise Lost‚Äù, and ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie, all of which are on Khan‚Äôs bookshelf aboard the *SS Botany Bay* in ‚ÄúThe Wrath of Khan‚Äù.

- Q‚Äôs gift to Kore is a vial of blue liquid with a tag reading *‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù* attached to it by twine. Maybe it‚Äôs a stretch, but this struck me as very reminiscent of the potion labeled *‚ÄúDrink Me‚Äù* in ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù, a work that Star Trek has referenced many times over the decades, going all the way back to the TOS episode, ‚ÄúShore Leave‚Äù. Though the Lewis Carroll story does describe the colour of the potion (only that it is not marked poison, and therefore safe for consumption) it is frequently depicted as blue in adaptations.

- Apparently Rios left his combadge behind last episode when he transported to *La Sirena*. Again. Lost communicator on a primitive world tally:

    - TOS: 1 - McCoy, ‚ÄúA Piece of the Action‚Äù

    - ENT: 1 - Reed, ‚ÄúThe Communicator‚Äù

    - PIC: 3 - Rios, ‚ÄúAssimilation‚Äù; ‚ÄúMonsters‚Äù; Picard, ‚ÄúMonsters‚Äù

- Ricardo gets sick after eating too much cake, which also happened to Juarti in ‚ÄúNapenthe‚Äù last season.

- Picard appears to be completely unphased by Wells‚Äô attempts at interrogation, which makes sense because he doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to Gul Madred, who interrogated and tortured Picard in ‚ÄúChain of Command‚Äù but was not able to break him.

- Q recognises Guinan, whom we learned he has a history with in ‚ÄúQ Who‚Äù, though he says the two of them haven‚Äôt crossed paths yet in the 21st century.

    - In ‚ÄúQ Who‚Äù, it was the first time Q had encountered Guinan using that name, but he‚Äôs aware of it here, because from his perspective, he‚Äôs met her using it previously.

- Guinan is able to telepathically communicate with Picard. I believe this is the first time an El-Aurian has exhibited this ability.

- In Wells‚Äô flashback the Vulcan attempting to mind meld with him is transported away. in ‚ÄúDaedalus‚Äù the human, Emory Erickson, was described as being *‚ÄùFather of the transporter‚Äù*, though that could be similar to Zephram Cochrane being *‚Äùthe discoverer of the space warp‚Äù* or Henry Archer creating the first warp five engine. Regardless, this is the earliest point in the timeline where we see Vulcans using a transporter.

- *‚ÄùShe‚Äôs looking to get a 400 year headstart on assimilating the galaxy.‚Äù* Though the Borg would control a large swath of the Delta Quadrant at this time period, prior to ‚ÄúBest of Both Worlds‚Äù they weren‚Äôt interested in assimilating people, only technology. *‚ÄùTheir priorities [seemed] to have changed,‚Äù* as Picard said at the time.",startrek,Canon Connections: Picard 2x08 - Mercy

1650608255,"One of my worries with star trek in its current form is the ease with which time travel and changing events in the past becomes a crutch for storylines - we see characters make a decision to ""change the past, to save the future"" and thereby restoring events that fit within the ""prime timeline"" i.e. the storyline of a TV series and the way it sl""should"" be. We also see characters break the prime directive, deliberately or otherwise and minor changes to be made to the timeline. This in many ways is an excuse to retcon visual and logical imperfections in the series: that time travel shenanigans since the original episode aired has meant that the timeline has subtly permanently changed in order to fit a new narrative and visual aesthetic. In many ways I'm not against this and it is of course part of the fun in discussing time travel. However, does this mean that there is less of a logic when characters go back in time and don't save characters who they were sad to lose? Tasha Year, Data, Heck, Picard in the Nexus didn't think to go back slightly further in time, save his brother and nephew, and then punch soran in the nose when he saw him in ten forward. If characters were to be brought back more easily would this risk making the series like marvel movies - where a characters death is rarely a reason we won't see them again and thereby lose the impact of their loss?",startrek,"time travel, storylines and immutability.

1656263209,"I'd love to get a high-quality edit to the fight with that conclusion.

Put simply, it was the end of Reva's story. She allowed revenge to cloud her judgement, and failed to assassinate Vader. The idea that she somehow survived ANOTHER lightsaber stab, and managed to get off-world is just ridiculous. They didn't even show her leave!

Don't writers know by now obvious things that will be nit-picked? Why would Reva even bother going after some kid? From what we saw, she didn't even tend to the gaping wound in her stomache. She was just walking around Tatooine, as if she was totally fine, and even had the energy to fight the Lars family, and chase down Luke. Why did she even want to kill him? She hated Vader for killing kids, yet travelled to Tatooine to do it, herself? How is that ""justice""??

Again, Vader should've killed Reva. The final episode of the series should've been focused exclusively on Obi-Wan and Vader. We didn't need Reva to go back to Tatooine at all. Hell, they could've left her fate up in the air.

1656262745,"Two things made me wonder: firstly, I find it hard to believe he'd mess up a sabre to the chest on Reva a 2nd time so I am left to suppose he might have done it on purpose; either as a Vader joke realizing he'd done it once before, or because he genuinely stayed his hand. The other reason is the way he seems to absolve Kenobi from responsibility for Vader's creation. Sure, he frames it in a typical Sith manner followed by ""I will destroy you!"" but I kind of wonder if it wasn't Anakin briefly breaking through to give what small mercies he was capable of as Vader.",StarWars,Did Vader secretly show compassion in Kenobi?

1656262210,"The reveal in TROS that Rey is Palpatine‚Äôs ‚Äúgranddaughter‚Äù (I think I‚Äôve read that her father is actually a Palpatine CLONE, not his actual son, in some expanded canon material), left us with huge huge gaps in the storytelling that we didn‚Äôt get, IMO, enough on screen to make that reveal feel satisfying and meaningful.

I believe this would sit so much better with me and other fans I‚Äôd we got a really solid series, animated or live action, that gave us that story. A show that showed Palpatine‚Äôs preparations for the Empire‚Äôs defeat in ROTJ, and scenes set on Exogol with the Sith Cultists. And centering it on Rey‚Äôs father and his journey rejecting his Clone ‚Äúfather‚Äù and going into hiding. 

There‚Äôs so much potential to make the sequels really feel tied into everything, maybe with some backstory and exposition on how this all fits in with the Chosen One prophesy, etc.

The only obstacle I see in making this is that I‚Äôm not sure if LF wants to invest in ST centric stories right now. And this series would need the care and production level of the clone wars to truly make it great. It would do for the ST what clone wars did for the PT in expanding the story and making everything feel more connected.

But I‚Äôm not sure LF would green light this type of story since they seem to not want to touch any of the ST stuff right now with the fandom seemingly more interested in OT-connected stories and the ‚Äúmando verse‚Äù timeline. 

Do we think Disney and LF will invest in such storytelling that will truly serve the sequel trilogy?",StarWars,Do we think Disney+/Lucasfilm will ever give us a fleshed out series to show us Rey‚Äôs father‚Äôs backstory?
1656262147,"1: Darth Vader gives up on turning Luke, so he kidnaps C-3PO, manages to give him his memories of being made by Anakin back, and attempts to turn him to the dark side, much to Palpatine's confusion and annoyance.

2: Jar Jar Binks is the chosen one with force powers and not Anakin.

3: C-3PO gets way too much into his Ewok God role and becomes official monarch of Endor, becoming a third party in The Force Awakens wanting to defeat both the Resistance since Luke is no longer with them as well as the First Order.

4: Darth Maul's legs somehow also survive with his upper body, becoming a recurring character in the following media. He is also clearly the better half of the two and has an adorable laugh that's done in Morse Code, and if he dies, Maul's upper body will also die, but not the other way around.

5: All vehicles have sentient computer AI, and can defy their pilots when they think they're being stupid.",StarWars,Which of these incredibly weird and nonsensical What If? scenarios I came up would make the franchise the most horrible?
1656262040,"Maybe I‚Äôm alone on this train of thought, but after exploring more of Vader‚Äôs character throughout the comics it seems clear to me that Vader wants to die. As we know, the thing Vader hates most, is himself.

The way I interpret the end of their fight in Obi-Wan, when Vader is screaming ‚ÄúObi-Wan!‚Äù I think he is basically asking for him to not leave him again, and finish the job. He clearly was in no state to fight, or else he would‚Äôve continued to fight Obi-Wan. 

At this point I believe Vader is fully aware he has been fooled by the Emperor, and there is nothing he can do to change it. So he continues to serve blindly. It isn‚Äôt until Luke arrives where perhaps Vader sees more to life than dying and serving. As he initially wants Luke to join him, so they can rule the galaxy as father and son.

He sees that his son will not make the same mistake that he once did, and in the end is willing to DIE for his son. His last act, as a Jedi.

Do you agree? Lmk what you think.",StarWars,Vader WANTS death.
1656260576,"The line from _Obi-Wan Kenobi_, ""I am what you made me"" isn't a reference to Vader's fall to the dark side. He's literally refering to his physical appearance, reminding Obi-Wan that **he** is the reason he needs a life support suit to survive.

Vader doesn't regret falling to the Dark Side (Anakin does). He regrets being defeated by Obi-Wan. That's why, when he sees that Obi-Wan is full of guilt, and no longer wanted to kill him, he ""comforts"" him by saying that he's not his failure. He **chose** his own path. Remember, before Anakin's fall, the two were on good terms. He didn't originally intend to kill Obi-Wan, yet, when Obi-Wan departed for Mustafar, he intended to kill Anakin. And of course, Anakin believed that Padm√© willingly brought him there.

The source of Obi-Wan's guilt is that he failed his apprentice, but the source of Vader's is that he failed to defeat his master. Of course, deep down, Anakin does regret his decision to turn to the dark side, but that's kept in check by his other personality.",StarWars,"Darth Vader hates Obi-Wan, not because he blames him for his fall to the Dark Side, but because he turned Padm√© against him and destroyed his body."
1656259884,"Dear Disney,
Hello there. You‚Äôve been doing a helluva job with all the new Star Wars shows. This is in contrast to the sequel movies, which were (to put it lightly) a disappointment to many of us.

I just finished Obi Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus. It was spectacular, like the Mandalorian before it. Thanks for giving the OT fans what we‚Äôve all been wanting for 40 years - something that looks, sounds and feels like Authentic Star Wars.

I‚Äôm all for Disney taking creative liberties with the franchise. It‚Äôs just that JJ Abrams‚Äô version of it was a dumpster fire. I wish someone could simply wipe my mind like a protocol droid so I could pretend the sequel movies never happened. But alas, I can‚Äôt unsee them.

So, I‚Äôm writing to request that you right those wrongs and use those creative liberties to provide a great service to the fans. 

Please consider hiring Quentin Tarantino to direct a Kill-Bill style revenge movie starring Samuel L. Jackson as a back-from the-dead Mace Windu, who comes back ready to own some mother fuckers.

This is the only thing left from Star Wars I really want to see before I die. That, and Baby Yoda kicking some ass at his side.

1656258992,"It is usually portrayed that the Empire / First Order used fear as their primary tactic to gain and keep control over the Galaxy (Episode 4). Fear and strength are a cornerstone of authoritarian rule. Another cornerstone tactic is propaganda. In Episode 3, Palpatine is seen justifying the attack on the Jedi Temple to the Senate by arguing that the Jedi have turned against him and therefore, against the Republic. I'm starting to think that the following galaxy-wide and merciless persecution of the Jedi was counterproductive. This cast the Jedi and their ideals as a rallying cry for resistance movements like the Rebellion, ultimately leading to the fall of the Empire. A more nuanced stance may have been more effective. But the Sith do deal in absolutes.

- Was there an ideological propaganda machine that worked to discredit the Jedi to accompany the Inquisitors who physically hunted them and instilled Fear to dissuade the common people from rendering aid to the fleeing Jedi?
- What was the nature of the Empire's 'control' over the average star system? Was it even necessary to run a massive propaganda machine if their military might versus the average planetary defense was overwhelming?

1656258750,"Make the focus on those that want revenge on Kenobi rather than Kenobi himself. Namely, Maul! (And one other I can think of)

There‚Äôs a couple things lingering that might be interesting to see:

-Maul‚Äôs time running Crimson dawn
-How Maul knows so much about Vader in Rebels

The spin-off could be a maul/crimson dawn focused story in which Maul is searching for Kenobi. Maul hears somehow of the events of OWK season 1 and seeks out Vader to gain insight on how to find Kenobi. We see the interaction of Crimson Dawn with the Empire and could even see an entourage of familiar criminals come into play like Hondo and a young Boba Fett and Bossk enter the story (seeing how a young boba becomes a favorite of Vader.)

This could culminate with an epic fight between maul and vader, where vader ultimately triumphs, which leads maul to rightly fear vader as we see he does in Rebels.

And meanwhile, one other foe also seeks out Kenobi for revenge‚Ä¶..Grievous. 

Grevious somehow survived ROTS and is also seeking Kenobi. Maybe maul and grievous go head to head as well, and somehow Grievous finds out that Kenobi is on tatooine, leading him to a final epic fight between Kenobi and grievous. 

This is a bit of a word vomit of cool ideas that would need clever and well written ways to make it all make sense but I do think there‚Äôs some cool stories to tell here if it focuses more on those who still want to find Kenobi and not just on Kenobi himself. Kenobi would be the Mcguffin rather than the main character.

Could even bring Katie sackoff in there as Bo katan to interface with her relationship to maul and kenobis history with her sister.

For context: I'm pretty au fait with Star Wars; watched all the movies, clone wars, rebels etc, and I've played Jedi Fallen Order, but I've never read any of the books or comics before, and there's a lot of them for a newbie to know where to start!

If there are any comics continuing the story of the inquisitors, that would certainly be of interest. I'd also be interested in other characters and periods if there's a strong ""this is definitely one to read"" (like the comic equivalent of KOTOR or something!)

Any recommendations from the community?",StarWars,I just finished reading Darth Vader Imperial Machine and I'm looking for recommendations for what to read next!

1656257235,"I commented this, on a recent post and I think it encapsulates some of the backlash these series have endured.

The biggest problem with both series was the main character

Let's start with Boba Fett.
Characterised as one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. Travelling around taking people down.
His scene in Mando S2 against the stormtroopers was a series highlight!
Then I loved and appreciated all the backstory and character growth but I don't think anyone appreciated Boba sat on tattoine for an entire series without so much of a sniff of his badass bounty hunting.

Thankfully the hints at the end of series one indicate Boba wants to leave tattoine as he's not suited to it. So going forwards we should get a better series 2

On to Obi Wan
Again presented as one of the most brilliant Jedi ever to have lived. Presented amazingly well through the movies and  clone wars and rebels.
Then to see him a broken man hiding away not using the force running from the empire it was a great grounded character portrayal and growth but not what the audience expected or dare I say wanted. As his confidence grew and he became more if his old self the reactions to the episodes got better

When we see series 2 let's hope for more of the character we love

I actually really enjoyed both series but thought these interesting points

Well these my opinions.
Hope you all continue to enjoy star wars",StarWars,Obi Wan and Bobas biggest problem
1656257197,"Everyone seems to think Vader is forgiving Kenobi and that it wasn't his fault that Anakin turned to the dark side. But that doesn't feel complete to me.

It doesn't make sense to me that Vader would ease kenobis mind by telling him that it's not his fault. After all, I thought Vader wanted to torture him both mentally and physically. I think Vader is actually just gloating about killing Anakin and it's meant to further scar kenobi who mourns his brother. Kenobi thought he only had to say goodbye once and now Vader has made it so he has to say again.

I feel like this is a deeper read into the scene than the one circulating. Obviously might be wrong. Thoughts?",StarWars,I think people might misinterpret that scene in S1E6 of Kenobi (spoiler)

But you have to understand that this whole miniseries wasn't planned, or well thought out.. They had this one cool idea (the Anakin / Obi-Wan scene in the finale) that they really wanted to make for the fans, and then they just sort of built a miniseries around it. You can even hear them say this in multiple interviews, they didn't know whether it should be a movie, a series, or something else.

That one scene was great (not perfect, but you have to admit it was pretty iconic and emotional), and the rest of the season was kinda just lazy, poorly written filler.

Since midichlorians lives in cells - and he lost quite a few. But...  


After fight with Dooku in ep. 2, in which he had lost an arm - Anakin said - since the last time we met my power have doubled. That would mean that the fact that he lost hand did not affect his power lvls.

For the main cast we have Light Side Reva, Roken and maybe Quinlan Vos (!). For the antagonist we'd have the Grand Inquisitor and maybe the Fifth Brother and Fourth Sister. This would conclude the secondary story of the Kenobi show, the Inquisitors chace of the Path.",StarWars,An idea for the rumored Reva spinoff
1656246634,"I needed some time to think about this topic because A) It's highly unnecessary, but B) My brothers and I had a discussion about it and I came to the conclusion that the fights can't be compared on an emotional level nor can they be compared in terms of the courses they take.

I say this because both conclude very different stories at very different points in both character's lives. Not to mention one is taking place on a planet with many levels and breakable mechanisms (Mustafar) while they other is straight-up rock spires.

Anyway, I want to talk purely about the quality of the fighting in Obi-Wan Vs. Vader VS Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin because I've watched back both fights several times back-to-back now and have deduced that while Episode 3 is fast-paced and very well choreographed, it feels to light and flashy. It has that strong sense of ""we planned this"", and it doesn't much feel like a true fight to the death. This may be because Obi-Wan isn't outright trying to kill Anakin as his resolve in Episode 3 is drastically different from his resolve in the finale of Obi-Wan, and to that I raise Anakin's side which still doesn't feel like he's swinging to kill. I won't be told that he's fighting himself inside to 'not kill'. He's there to kill. No questions asked and the same could be argued for Obi-Wan but I'll let the ""Obi-Wan still loves him"" argument slide (listen to me, speaking as if I have this mighty opinion lol).

With that said however, Obi-Wan Vs. Vader feels heavy. It feels primal and gritty-- like a real fight to the death where every swing is swung to deal damage. It feels real and it's funny because they do inflict damage on one another whether it be via force, which, hey! They're using the force in this fight! Or by way of sabre.

Put simply, these two fights side-by-side are like a super well-choreographed fight in an action film versus a real fight in the UFC \[Octagon\]. Both are good but you can feel the legitimacy in performance in one versus the other and I'd be lying if I said that Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin had more heft in its combat over Obi-Wan Vs. Vader.

I'm not saying one fight is better than the other. I'm purely stating that 1) I like Obi-Wan Vs. Vader more than Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin, and 2) Obi-Wan Vs. Vader feels like the better fight in terms of its deliverance on a fight \[to the death\] and what it truly means for two combatants to be fighting to kill each other.",StarWars,Obi-Wan Vs.

So she said that due to the Rouge Squadron movie's release date being delayed due to creative differences, there might be a chance that Taika Watiti's Star Wars film, which was originally supposed to be released in late 2025, might take Rouge Squadron's release date and be released in late 2023 (2 years earlier).

My question is that, I don't remember production for Taika's movie starting, or even actors being casted, then how the hell is he supposed to complete the project by late 2023?

1656238471,"Obi Wan did it to Anakin at the end of RotS and spent ten years believing that he was dead. Obviously he intended for him to die. But he didn't, and it turned out that the crazy, powerful, Jedi-hunting Sith Lord terrorising the galaxy was Anakin.

Lesson learnt? Nope, he does the exact same thing again, leaving Anakin to continue his reign of terror despite knowing what he has become. Anything that Vader does now is particularly Obi Wan's responsibility.

Anakin buried Obi Wan in rocks and left him to die. He was winning the fight, and if he had just checked that Obi Wan was actually dead he could have done so. But no, he allowed Obi Wan the chance to escape and sneak up on him. He then lost the fight and could have been killed.

Reva stabbed the Grand Inquisitor in exactly the same way she was stabbed as a child and survived. She knew that it was possible to survive such a wound, whether through dark side powers or not, so she really should have made sure that she followed through. Leaving him alice ended up being part of her undoing.

I'm not sure if Anakin really intended to Kill Reva the second time or not, but leaving her alive almost inadvertently led to the death of the son he didn't yet know he had. If she had gone through with the murder of Luke, and if she had told him about it (which I assume she would, otherwise it's a pretty pathetic revenge) then he would have regretted not killing her properly.

First of all, loved the episode. But I had some questions.  
In the beginning of the episode, Obi Wan takes the shuttle and flies off to the planet to draw the Star Destroyer away from the rebel transport. Vader demands that they follow Obi Wan, then he takes his own shuttle and lands for the whole fight scene. 

First of all, this didn't make sense to me. Why couldn't Vader have followed Obi Wan while the Star Destroyer continued following the rebel transport? Why didn't they deploy multiple tie-fighters to handle either ship?

Anyway, after the fight Obi Wan gets on his shuttle and flies off the planet (presumably straight to Tatooine). Next time we see Vader, he's on Mustafar. But what happened to the Star Destroyer? Was it in orbit around the planet while Obi Wan and Vader fought? How did it miss Obi Wan flying away? Wouldn't they have been tracking Obi Wan's ship?

Maybe I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief and say that Obi Wan flew to the other side of the planet where the Star Destroyer couldn't see him or something? Or did I miss something?

Not gonna say she‚Äôs my favorite Star Wars character, but I like her arc and even before episode 5 I liked the fact that she was a very active inquisitor who seemed to actually apply plans which had reason to work. Then during episode 5 it feels like she has a lot better motivations, and her letting go of revenge in episode 6 was a nice way to conclude her arc.

Though using Leia as bait was a bit more far fetched and at times, and it did feel like she had plot armor at times as well.

I think another problem was the show she‚Äôs in. A lot of people came to Obi-wan Kenobi to see‚Ä¶ well Obi-wan and Vader. With Reva she‚Äôs a new character who fans will see as taking screen time away from Obi-wan and Vader, which she kinda did.

We know from the sequel trilogy that force ghosts can use their power in the physical realm, in the same way a living Jedi can, such as for moving objects. Obi Wan alludes to this himself in Empire Strikes Back when he says ""if you face Vader, you do so alone, I cannot interfere"", which could also mean that he's ""interfered"" before and is now choosing not to

1656211378,"Before I get into it, I just want to say that I enjoyed the show. I loved seeing Ewan and Hayden on screen again and the fight between Obi Wan and Anakin was awesome. The split open mask and the voice changing was incredible. I enjoyed little Leia and Tarla. I would always rather to have a show of this caliber than to not have the show at all. But I do wish this show could have been something more.

I was talking with my buddy and he pointed out that the biggest fault of this show is that nothing substantively happened. In large part Obi Wan and Vader remain the same. They largely are the people they are in the OT- I didn't find my understanding of them changed. Perhaps Obi Wan is more clearly sorry for what happened to Anakin, Padme and Luke and Leia, but we already know that in ROTS. There are allusions to how the Galactic Empire will react to kidnapping of a senator's daughter, or if Sidious finds Vader's attachment to his former master an issue, but nothing comes of it in the show.  

A lot of people gawked at the nuance added by Anakin saying Vader killed Anakin, not Obi Wan. Or that Obi Wan called him Darth. That is all stuff we knew, stuff that the happy accident of George retconning a little bit. The brevity of the OT is and has been understood that Obi Wan did not want to reveal to Luke that Vader was his father. Was it cool, yes. Did it change what we knew, no. 

Obi Wan's situation has not changed whatsoever. He's still on Tatooine, Leia and Luke are still safe, we confirm that he does actually connect with Qui Gon, which we already knew. He's still on the run from Vader. We learn how he reconnects with the force, but we knew he was connected to the force to begin with in ANH, so this show is basically just introducing that he disconnected from the force. Its very similar to how Luke is portrayed in TLJ, with the key difference being the viewer already knows where Obi Wan is going to end up. The mystery of what will happen is not as suspended as when Luke force projects to fight Kylo Ren.

Vader is still searching for Obi Wan. He's still Vader. At best we got a conversation about where his loyalties lie, which I would assume would have been a question prior given that both of them knew Obi Wan still lived. Obviously Obi Wan can't tell Vader about his children, but they don't even mention Padme, surely there might be some unresolved issues given their last meeting. Just spitting a hypothetical here, I'm not a writer.

I know that this show would have been tricky to write otherwise. It would be hard to have these character interact, somehow neither Vader or Obi Wan kill each other, but the issue still stands. The biggest change is that Reva, a new character, is no longer an inquisitor and is now free so to speak. Everyone else returns to life as it was.

Perhaps my favorite moment is when Obi Wan learns Anakin survived and became Vader. Which was awesome and an incredible scene. It will be one of the main takeaways for me, but I do not think it is substantive, even if it is powerfully emotional. 

As a Star Wars fan of almost 30 years, I have always loved the OT and its storytelling. It has surprising twist and turns that change the ball game. After watching Obi Wan, I do not feel like I learned or can expand much on my understanding of Obi Wan or Vader in the OT. He's the same. We get a bit more of how it happened, but compare that to (incoming mando/boba fett spoilers) &gt;!what we learn about Luke's temple when Grogu chooses to leave and return to Din. We know luke's temple fails but now we see that he was having trouble finding students who were committed to learning to become a jedi. !&lt; 

At any rate, I loved the show, but I just wanted to share my thoughts because I hadn't seen it posted. As always, feel free to disagree, that is a pillar of our community :)

1656205382,"First off there are a lot of good things to say about the Obi-Wan show. It had a lot of good action scenes, brought back memorable characters, and featured Vader in his prime. However, the show in no way explored Obi-Wan as a character the way The Mandalorian or the Book of Boba fleshed out their titular characters. Instead it was mostly focused on Young Leia, which in my opinion was entirely disappointing.

The show paints Obi-Wan as a boring character whose sole purpose is to refight Anakin Skywalker in the form of Darth Vader. His only story arch is that he has been disconnected from the force which we as an audience have seen 2 times before already in Star Wars as well as in Spider-Man 2 with Tobey Maguire where his powers fade because he stops caring about being Spider-Man. Boring.

Ewan Mcgregor‚Äôs acting abilities were severly underutilized because his character did not grow. He just returned to the character he always was. Meanwhile Young Leia takes the stage and talks like Young Sheldon, with a technical savvy to match that we never saw in later movies.

I‚Äôm hoping if there is a second season Disney will actually focus on Obi-Wan as a character rather than forcefully trying to turn Leia into a Disney Princess with the goal of selling merchandise.

1656201309,"TL;DR:  &gt;!Porkins is Snoke.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Jek Tono Porkins was a rebel pilot who participated in the final assault on the first Death Star. Very heavy from a young age, he was nicknamed ""Piggy"" and ""Belly Runner"". Always angry at being called out for being overweight, Porkins was, in turn, well known in the Rebel ranks for gleefully hazing new recruits.

Porkins seemingly perished when his X-wing fighter was shot down by a TIE fighter. His fighter, engulfed in flame, crashed on the surface of the Death Star, which would be destroyed by Luke Skywalker mere minutes later.

...

Porkins awoke, surrounded by hooded figures with medical instruments.  
""Quick, he is awake!"" they scrambled.  
The survivor instinctively lifted his hand and the group of hooded figures began to float upwards, choking. ""Where am I? Who are you!?"" the survivor demanded.  
""You are on the planet Exegol, deep within the Unknown Regions,"" one of the figures managed to say. ""We have kept you alive.""  
Porkins slowly loosened his grip on the floating figures and let them touch the ground again. ""How long?""  
""It has been more than a decade. Tell us, powerful one, whom do you hate enough to have survived this long?""  
""The Rebellion! Skywalker!"" he hissed.

...

The hooded men explained what had happened. After the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial Navy investigated the debris field and found one piece of the Death Star curiously untouched. On this piece of debris, the wreckage of an X-wing fighter still contained one badly burnt survivor clinging onto life. His uniform provided his name: Jek Tono Porkins. Initially placing him in a bacta tank to heal him for later interrogation, the Emperor quickly began to suspect that Porkins's survival was no accident, but somehow connected to the Force. The Emperor was intrigued and asked the survivor be fully healed.

The healing process of Porkins was peculiar, however; he would begin to heal, only to rapidly deteriorate, in an endless cycle. The Imperial scientists continued to study the case of Porkins. They eventually discovered a correlation: Porkins would only heal up to the point of his body being able to physically process the provided intravenous sustenance. As adipose deposits began to emerge on his body, however, he would begin to deteriorate until they were depleted again. They could not understand the underlying mechanism of this pattern.

As the Empire fell, the Porkins laboratory was secretly moved to Exegol, where the project was taken over by the Sith Eternal. Ever hoping to understand the Force better in an effort to bring back their master, the scientific understanding of the Force by the Sith Eternal finally provided the missing link in the investigation. Porkins had an abnormally high midichlorian count and could replenish the midichlorians rapidly, but as his weight increased, while the concentration of midichlorians in his core tissues would remain mostly the same, the midichlorian concentration in his adipose deposits was far below expected. They concluded that as Porkins gained more and more weight, his apparent Force sensitivity would decrease, a result of Porkins unconsciously using his connection to the Force to keep his body functional far beyond the point when his unnaturally high weight should have caused an early death.

When Porkins's X-wing was shot down, the cockpit became engulfed in flame, which swiftly began to destroy huge portions of his adipose tissue. Burning in the cockpit, the loss of adipose tissues allowed Porkins to begin calling more and more consciously on the Force to keep himself alive, until, finally, Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star. At that moment, the nascent Force potential and the latent dark side tendencies of Porkins found focus in his rage at being so casually abandoned to burn to death by the Rebellion and Luke Skywalker's decision to destroy the Death Star instead of attempting to save him.

After their discovery of Porkins's unique midichlorian distribution, the Sith Eternal started a new avenue of treatment. As adipose deposits, with their minute midichlorian presence, began to form on his body, they would be surgically removed, allowing the core tissues of Porkins to continue to heal after years of stagnation. They soon discovered this approach to have an additional benefit: the adipose tissues removed from Porkins were a living, growing source of tissue that still had some concentration of midichlorians after removal, no matter how minute. This tissue could not only be used as a basis for creating clones of Porkins that would be Force sensitive, but, when properly processed, they could be grafted onto the cloned body of Darth Sidious, at which point the midichlorians present would diffuse throughout it. Subsequently, the Porkins tissue would be removed, having fulfilled its role as, essentially, a midichlorian transfusion.

The Sith Eternal systematically removed Porkins's adipose tissue as it emerged. It was an arduous process and it took months before Porkins's core organs would be healed enough to allow him out of the bacta tank. It would take even longer to have a sufficient amount of Porkins's adipose deposits to fully empower the clone body of Darth Sidious, though that process eventually became faster as Porkins clones began to supply more and more of the required material.

Porkins, of course, fully submerged in the Dark Side, was not very interested in the mechanics of his survival. He only wished to have revenge on the Rebellion and Skywalker.

The Sith Eternal were all too happy to provide an opportunity, having finally found a perfect leader for the first phase of their plan: Porkins was extremely powerful with the Force, was familiar with the tactics of the Rebellion, and was wholly committed to their destruction, most of all Skywalker and his new Jedi.

Porkins was warned that he should never gain weight in order not to lose his conscious connection to the Force, which he took to heart, remaining unnaturally thin, almost corpse-like, for the remainder of his days.

Before taking full control of the First Order, Porkins elected to choose a new name. He would no longer be Jek Tono Porkins, ""Piggy"", ""Belly Runner"", the laughing stock of the Rebellion. He was the opposite of that pathetic fool now. He first reversed his name into SNikrop Onot KEj and then shortened it. From this point onward, he would be known as Snoke.",StarWars,Jek Porkins lives

That was a star destroyer, it must have had a hundred small ships, and probably dozens of medium-sized ships that could have out-run and destroyed that transport ship, easily.

I know it was probably done for plot reasons, but there is no logical in-universe reason why Vader, however  emotional he was, would not have at least let The Grand Inquisitor, or some other ships go after the rebels, especially considering the atrocities he committed in the past, and that Vader was going to be the only one to face everyone, so at that time there was no reason The Grand Inquisitor couldn't go and do something else...

It was metallic gold and it came in a pink and purple box I believe. I know it had a barcode on the bottom because I remember looking it up on eBay (I liked doing that when I was a kid) 

It had a black stand with a ball joint, and a bit of the neck but no shoulders. It‚Äôs eye lit up and it did not make any sound

1656187289,"During the conversation at the end of the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader, we get two little easter eggs.

1) Vader pointedly says that he killed Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi later repeats this to Luke in IV. This neatly ties up the fact that Lucas had not yet decided (during the making of IV) who Vader would be. This line became a sticking point in later movies, such that they had to have Obi-Wan retcon it onscreen for Luke in Episode VI.

2) In IV, Kenobi referred to Vader as ""Darth"" during their saber duel on the Death Star. It's often been remarked that Kenobi's use of that as a name in IV seemed not to track with him knowing who Vader actually is. Now we get to see him consciously make the decision to use that name to acknowledge his friend's death.

There is no way that she could've connected Anakin and Luke from a busted hologram message. No ONE other than Bail, Owen/Beru, Yoda and Obi Wan know who Luke is. Not even Palpatine knew this.

Then you can say , he was connected to Obi Wan somehow and she wanted to harm luke for revenge to Obi Wan. If you use that reasoning then everything in episode 5 made no sense.

 In episode 5 her true motivation was Vader. Obi Wan handed Vader to her on a platter and she failed. From that point forward logically there should be no ill will towards Obi Wan. He did what she truly wanted so her actions toward him are null and void.

And Let's be honest about it, we do not need a plot about characters being in ""Danger"" when we know exactly what happens with those characters, Leia and Luke were never in any danger, the only danger they were in were being screwed over with canon.

This show STEALS, and yes STEALS from other well written Star Wars content, Jedi Fallen Order plot of sneaking in the same exact way in the Inquisitor fortress, Vader helmet cut scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin from Rebels which was written by Filoni, and for some reason they reference the Last Jedi of all movies with a Chase scene after a tiny ass transport ship yet AGAIN Damaged with no hyperdrive. WHILE NOT USING TIE-FIGHERS? Which they also didn't use in the Fortress.

So Reva survived a lightsaber stab TWICE? None of them makes sense, but the first one happened to her when she was only a youngling, which means that even if she would suddenly turn to the dark side for power, she was not even close to be as a strong force user as she would be in order to survive. She wasn't Maul or Anakin who were both exceptional force users and fighters, filled with extreme hatred, and both of them used the dark side before their injuries.   


The second stab makes a bit more sense (let's say that Reva's hatred kept her alive"", but even Maul needed help and Anakin needed artifical libs and systems... the force itself wouldn't be enough to fuel their bodies forever. They still needed some kind of medical help.   


Also, HOW the hell could Reva NOT just get up after that stab, leaving the rebel's base, get healed, and find a terribly fast ship, but she was able to reach tatooine FASTER than Kenobi?

Anyway, having visions in Star Wars that predict the future or show alternate timelines is nothing new, but I think this concept would be fascinating. It could show how powerful Darth Vader could have become, not being limited by his injuries and suit.

I've fully fleshed out the plot description as best as I can, sticking as close to the information of what it would've looked like available to me. There will be contentious things in here, ""Uber"" character morphing from Maul and into an entity less person within the story, so I've taken a few creative decisions on things like that with a wider plan on how I think it could've work based on some of George's other comments about a ""micro biotic world"" and what ""uber"" would fit that person best.

Below is a link to the Plot Description and below that is a bit of a timeline of key events that make up the backstory. Not all the answers are there purposely as they would be expanded upon in Episode VIII.

1656163012,"Me and my friend have been questioning this topic for like 2 hours now
Do you think it's Anakin? Rey? Luke? Or someone else?",StarWars,Who do you think is the chosen one?
1656162716,"So yeah basically the title Reva is just a retread of Starkiller from legends. They are both Jedi younglings spared by Vader then taken in by him to be trained in the ways of the darkside, who are then ""murdered"" by him. They both  then go against there training in an attempt to redeem themselves. While I personally am not a fan of Reva or that her entire arc is based on a character I much prefer I will say I feel the backlash is undeserved and I think Moses Ingram did a great job with what she was given I just feel that Reva's arc was slightly underdeveloped. 

I do wonder if the backlash would have been this bad if the show had instead opted to just use Galen Merek instead of Reva.

I do hope that there use of the broadstrokes of Galen's story doesn't rule out a future appearance of the character as I feel he may be the most popular legends character that isn't post OT era to not be canonised so far.",StarWars,Reva is Starkiller
1656162242,"You know Solo was actually the first Star Wars movie I saw in cinema I thought it was good critics however didn‚Äôt, the problem with Solo is that Harrison Ford couldn‚Äôt play Han Solo and instead we got someone who looked nothing like younger Harrison Ford I would recommend Solo to an ot fan, even though a Han Solo origin story movie is not needed but it‚Äôs not as bad as the sequels i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs as good as rogue one. I‚Äôm not arguing against any points that were why it was bad I‚Äôm instead going to say a few reasons why I liked it.
‚Äî The Falcon ‚Äî
The millennium falcon is one of the most iconic if not the most iconic starships in Star Wars and I think having the escape pod where the gap on the falcon is makes sense. Although the plans for the falcon say that it‚Äôs on where the cockpit is, it‚Äôs never used and still Han could‚Äôve modified it. There‚Äôs 10 years between the final scene and a new hope Han has time.
‚Äî Lando ‚Äî
Ok this may be a little controversial but Lando in this movie looks like a younger version of Lando from the empire strikes back. If you disagree with me then fuss over it in the comments. Now Landon‚Äôs character is pretty much kept in Solo, he‚Äôs still a  dick so there. I never liked Lando tbh because he was such a scumbag even to his own friends. However this movie made Lando a more likeable character imo him hating Han and hell even cheating to keep his ship made him seem a lot more protective now rebels shows he learned his lesson but still I think I like this version more.
‚Äî plot ‚Äî
There‚Äôs a lot more plot in solo than the sequels it makes sense as the ot and pt also had a strong plot. The plot makes sense and Han starting the rebel alliance makes sense too I never considered Han to be an antihero apart from in ANH and this movie makes him seem like a hero thinking he was a villain instead of an antihero.

In conclusion I think that solo should have been a book (yes ik of the Han Solo books in legends apparently it‚Äôs quite accurate to them I haven‚Äôt read them I can‚Äôt sat) but still it‚Äôs a good movie it shows Han Solo works as a protagonist, however Harrison Ford is irreplaceable as Han Solo, it flopped, I also think that it would‚Äôve been better as a animated movie/tv series I would recommend it to any ot/Han Solo fan. It does not wreak the character.",StarWars,(Controversial opinion) Solo is a good movie held back by the time it was written
1656160826,"I‚Äôve binged watched Kenobi over the last two days and felt a little confused.

I‚Äôm not sure where I heard it (or even if I heard it at all) but wasn‚Äôt it said that Vader was never able to find Kenobi in the time between ROTS and a New Hope?

I‚Äôm probably wrong but can someone just clarify that for me.",StarWars,Help me understand something.
1656159150,"I noticed that in the series, Vader usually refers to him ‚ÄòKenobi‚Äô like ‚ÄòKenobi is all that matters now‚Äô , or ‚ÄòKenobi means nothing. However when Anakin is shining through a little bit like after their fight, he refers to him as ‚Äòobi-wan‚Äô, which is what Anakin always called him in the prequels because of how close they were. This made me a little bit more emotional because it highlights his conflict even more.",StarWars,Detail about Vader in Obi-wan Kenobi
1656159132,"just curious if anyone has a rough idea how much of the fan base is men vs women?

1656158195,"The Skywalker Saga is being bled dry at the moment and we need something new. Apart from the High Republic books, every new content in the past 10 years has taken place in the same 60-year period. Side-characters without character are being given whole shows, every new content seems to spend half its time being a conveyor belt of backdoor pilots and cameos of the same 20-odd characters (looking at you Mando S2).

Alongside this, with the exception of a couple shows and films, the majority of content has been thematically weak, i couldn't for the life of me tell you what the overall message of Boba Fett or Kenobi was, what was the point of the story they were trying to tell? Boba Fett almost had something with the Tuskens and the theme of finding a family and purpose after years of solitude, but dropped this after a couple of episodes in favour of Mando S2.5. Kenobi could've been a really introspective series about the force, religion, and Kenobi's PTSD, even though the latter was touched upon throughout the series it was often pushed to the side in favour of yet another lone wolf and cub story, and whatever the hell they were trying to do with Reva (child murder is bad was her development??).

These weaknesses are coupled with the fact that we know what's going to happen to most of the characters. However cool the last fight was, we know Kenobi and Vader aren't going to die or get seriously injured like in ROTS; we know Leia is going to get back safe; we know Reva isn't going to kill Luke, Owen or Beru. By making every new story happen between already established stories the stakes are severely depleted and the potential for compelling storytelling is diminished. The Skywalker Saga worked because whilst it was a family drama, it also had galaxy spanning stakes. Anakin's fall led to the fall of the Republic and rise of the Empire, and his redemption toppled the Empire and brought about the return of the Jedi. Yet by sticking to this time frame, nothing of significance can really happen, Boba Fett was limited to creating a galactic crime syndicate consisting of one town.

What Star Wars needs is to stop beating the dead horse of the Skywalker Saga and move onto a new saga unrelated to any pre-established characters. Personally I would love for a trilogy of films covering the early days of the Jedi and the birth of the Sith, it would have the potential to tell a deeply thematic story and also have galaxy-spanning stakes. We'd be able to see the Jedi and Republic in their infancy, the first Jedi to fall to the dark side, the creation of the Sith, how their everlasting conflict was created, maybe even show how the prophecy of the Chosen One came about. We'd also be able to get new planets, species, ships, droids, aesthetics completely detached from previous designs (IMO sounds better than the 100th TIE Fighter or variation of a Stormtrooper helmet).

Star Wars used to be full of imagination and wonder, yet it has regressed into repeating the same tropes and stories ad nauseum, with it only surviving on nostalgia at this point. I really hope Lucasfilm starts to move past the Skywalker Saga and into more creatively rewarding stories, otherwise I really don't think there's much left for me anymore.",StarWars,Star Wars needs a new saga urgently.
1656157169,"I don't like the artistic decision, especially in the new Obi-Wan series, to have the lightsabers emit SO MUCH light, even in bright lighting conditions. Even though it's supposed to look more realistic, it bothers me. It always feels like people holding an LED tube in their hands (which of course they are). In a strange way, it destroys the immersion for me.

Kylo Ren was somewhat interesting as a character (or at least started out as such), but sadly suffered from those badly written movies in which they had no real plan for him ( or any of the characters really). Plus, I rather not have someone related to the original cast again. 

How about they introduce some new Sith already?  The Star Wars lore/history is filled with interesting and imposing Sith, but we always go back to the same worn out dude in black.

Other than Alderaan, the Lars homestead, and Cloud City, the majority of their actions can be somewhat justified as simply trying to get rid of an insurrectionist group. I guess this is why I feel like they should've made a series in between the releases of ANH and TESB, so we could get more of that, in other words, once more Star Wars shows it works better as a TV series than a movie Series.",StarWars,Something I noticed in the OT
1656145650,"Have the show begin with a time skip, just between episodes 4-5. Reva has begun helping smuggle force sensitive children away from the empire as a ‚Äúmasked jedi vigilante‚Äù, but specifically without a lightsaber, instead spending her free time meditating, since her anger and vaders strength with the force gave him the upper hand. At the end of episode one I want their to be another confrontation with Vader. He still bests her, but he isn‚Äôt there to kill her. He has learned from Boba fett the identity of the pilot who destroyed the death star is his son, and that the emperor lied to him about his wifes death. Just like in the comics with darth vader and doctor Aphra, he is attempting to recruit Reva as one of many allies against the emperor. It was his plan for him and luke to tule together originally, and the comics show how much he hates the emperor, he cracked the glass of a star destroyer when he found out he had a son and thought of the emperors lies. Would be an interesting dynamic. Would also love to see an inquisitor saber with cleansed white crystals.

1656145540,"Am I the only one that's actually sick of hearing the force theme every two minutes. Imperial March would've gotten old being played with Vader every time he shows up as well. Great music but a lot of it was so overplayed in the sequels that I couldn't be happier with this less is more approach. It should be saved for the right moments, and that is exactly what the Obi Wan show did. It saved the Imperial March for that final Vader moment and it was all the more rewarding for it.

The point is, Star Wars music is so iconic at this point that hearing a repeated track actually takes me out of the show. Instead of it enhancing the scene I'm just kind of listening to the music. And if its played constantly like the Force Theme in the Sequel trilogy I eventually start rolling my eyes.

I was glad that the Obi Wan show opted to do its own music, it shows restraint not to rely on constant nostalgia trips by not blasting the old stuff over every scene. Online everyone's going, ""Why didn't they play the Order 66 theme when Reva fought Vader"" or ""Why didn't they play Battle of the Heroes during the rematch."" Uh, maybe because it would be super on the nose.

Sometimes less is more. I don't want to hear the force theme every time something vaguely force related happens. Use it to hint at the force perhaps but it doesn't need to happen when Obi Wan lifts a bunch of rocks, nor does Battle of the Heroes need to happen every time Vader and Obi Wan get in a fight.

While we're on the subject I've also heard a lot of ridiculous stuff like, I thought this was the Obi Wan show not the Reva show. Oh God forbid a show have other significant characters in it that aren't Obi Wan. Its still very clearly Obi Wan's show, his journey, his arc. 

I won't deny, Obi Wan had some very sloppy writing to the point where I still can't decide whether I like this show. It has some incredible moments and a lot of really stupid ones. But most people aren't complaining about the writing as much as they do about Reva or the soundtrack. 

I honestly couldn't understand people's problem with Reva. The most consistent thing I hear is the acting but I don't understand that either. I've seen worse acting from Mark Hamil yet everyone worships Luke Skywalker. She's a well rounded character with clear motivations. At least until the end where she thinks she'll get back at Vader by going after the son he doesn't even know about, but she's not exactly the most rational person.",StarWars,I'm tired of people bitching about the Obi Wan soundtrack

1656141731,"Seems like the writers are trying to suggest that Vader's conflicted feelings over Obi Wan held him back a bit based on Palpatine's comment at the end. But this doesn't jibe with established lore about how the dark side works.

The dark side is fueled by hatred. And Vader's hatred for Kenobi is so intense that he should have been hulking out during his duel with Kenobi no? But Kenobi still outperformed him with the lightsaber and in the use of force powers.

So did Kenobi's connection to the force somehow deepen during his time on Tatooine? Seems pretty unlikely that Vader was having second thoughts about killing his former master.",StarWars,"After watching Kenobi, do you think Obi Wan is more powerful than Vader?"
1656140575,"I've always assumed that the force had something to do with it, that anything with the ability to process information would have the force flowing through it filling it with the same connection that flows through all other living things and making it so that the processing of that information creates emotions within the droids in the same way learning about the world creates emotions in a child that define its view on the world.

1656140177,"This entire series has massive plot holes and inconsistencies. To name just a few:

Leia running from 3 adults that cannot catch her. Then from Obi Wan on the roofs. How hard could it be to ourun a 10 year old? Not to mention going past Organa's security etc

E5 close range shootout between rebels and troopers is hilarious. You see troopers going down and only 1-2 rebels. This should have been a masacre of the rebels that are untrained and poorly equiped but still manage to kill more troopers than lose 

E6 plot holes: Reva is left for dead by Vader. Then she just walks away, finds a ship (from were?) flyes to Tatooine and arrives on Tatooine city in the morning. Meanwhile a whole star destroyer cannot catch or kill the rebel ship. They forgot about the tractor beam apparently. So the few minutes/ hours the ships chase eachother is enough for Reva to travel to Tatooine.
Then she waits for the night because a sith cannot kill a boy in daylight. 

Then Obi Wan and Vader find another place that could support life and face eachother. Then Obi refuses to kill Vader for whatever reason... Then Obi senses Luke is in danger and arrives on Tatooine instantly just in time to see Reva carring a 10 yo boy for hundreds of meters with a lightsaber hole in her gut.

4: Yuuzhan Vong: As someone whos favourite era of Star Wars is the post ROTJ EU, this would be a dream of mine. Plus the whole description of the episode having a creepy X-Files feel to it sounds really cool

5: Son of Dathomir: Another obvious choice, it would make a hell of a season finale; Continuing Maul's arc, giving some rare character development to Palpatine, wrapping up Talzin's arc and most importantly setting up season 7.

but with the Kenobi tv series bringing back nostalgia

I was wondering how others thought of Darth Maul's first appearance.

I saw episode 1 in the theaters when it first came out.  
I didn't think much in his first appearance in the desert.. other than that he had a light saber with a very long hilt.

But that fight later on when DM took on Obiwan and Quigon, that was awesome.  Especially the first time you saw the second light saber turn on, making it like a light staff.  That was so cool and a lot of people around me thought.. Wow.. i didn't know you could use a light saber in that way.

also Ray Park's athleticism and movement made the light saber fights in episodes 4-6 look stiff in comparison.  Of course, story wise, we know Vader is stronger.  but back then watching Darth Maul move about, made him seem like the strongest Star Wars villain at that time.

Though something confused me - Reva tells Obi-Wan that Vader is still alive and he's shook to the core. Now what I don't get is this is 10 years after RoTS right? Yeah Obi-Wan has been hiding out being a hermit on Tatooine for that time but how would he not know Vader is alive? 10 years after RoTS this should be Vader prime time ruling no? Of course the way Anakin felt about sand makes it very unlikely Vader himself would go to Tatooine but even still he's a galaxy known sith lord so where was Vader for these 10 years?

Natalie Portman is already under contract with Disney to play the Mighty Thor in the upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder, and likely several sequel projects as well. Therefore, I figured it would be easy to bring her back to play Padme again. Alas, she didn't appear in the show in any way. 

But should she appear in the future? Should we see more of Padme's relationship with Anakin? Should we see further into her mindset regarding the Clone Wars (which she firmly opposed)? Could we see a show centered around Padme in between Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones?",StarWars,Should Padme Amidala appear in more Star Wars projects? (Obi Wan Episode 6 Spoilers!)

Is it to sound more intimidating?

Does the breathing apparatus alter Anakin's voice under the helmet?

Will we see Anakin/Vader in Ahsoka? (I haven't watched anything other than the movies, ObiWan, and Mandalorian but I heard Ahsoka and Anakin have history)

Again it is a very silly question. I also ask because Vader was using both voices after Obi Wan defeated him in the show. It sounded cool. That scene was cool and I appreciate Hayden Christensen portraying Vader and partially revealing his face. Because under the helmet and in costume while having his lines voiced by someone else, it doesn't really matter who the actor playing Vader is. But the fact that Hayden was shown to do both was awesome.

One thing I would have liked to have seen is Vader struggling to breathe with his helmet broken. But I don't know all the details about his prior injuries.",StarWars,Silly question about Vader's voice.
1656125116,"So I‚Äôm re-watching the finale of OBI-WAN KENOBI and I gotta ramble about the relationship between Palpatine and Vader‚Ä¶ 

It blows my mind that Palpatine not only manipulated Anakin into trusting him, leading to Anakin‚Äôs fall to the dark side, but upon putting the suit on him, good ol‚Äô Sheev outright tells Vader that his anger killed Padme. Without hesitation, and knowing full well that he had Vader completely under his influence, he said ""hey bud, I know I told you that the dark side who help you save Padme, but it actually killed her. Sucks eh? Wanna go build the Death Star now? AND VADER AGREED. BRO SCREAMED NO AND THEN FURTHER PLEDGED HIMSELF TO THE MAN WHO EFFECTIVELY CAUSED THE DOMINOS TO FALL THAT ENDED WITH PADME‚ÄôS DEATH. And for the next 25 years or so, Vader acted like a good lap dog, following every command that Papa Palpatine gave him. 

I guess I find it interesting that Vader never outright tried to seek revenge on Palpatine. Maybe he knew he‚Äôd never succeed, or maybe his hate for himself was too strong to overcome, and Palpatine was the only person willing to stand by him, so he gave himself over to the dark side forever. I think it also shows how powerful the dark side can be when you have hate as strong Vader does. We obviously saw it in Maul, but Vader‚Äôs an entirely different beast. Maul was driven by revenge, Vader is driven by self-hatred. And in that self-hatred, he could never bring himself to break apart from Palpatine. The man who destroyed his world and everything he loved‚Ä¶ he continues to stand by him. 

In short, I love this finale, and the relationship between Palpatine and Anakin/Vader will always be fascinating to me.

1656121165,"I‚Äôve seen various discussions on Kenobi‚Äôs score, particularly earlier on during the show‚Äôs run, but haven‚Äôt heard too much since the finale was released.  Most of the reactions to the score have been very negative.  And of course, spoilers for the show are present. 

*A sidebar before I get into it too much, I just want to mention to not blame the composer for the use or lack of use of existing themes.  The composer is bringing about the desires of the production.  If they wanted existing Star Wars themes to be used, they would have been used.  ESPECIALLY on something like Star Wars, the composer isn‚Äôt going to get to just do what they want.  Not to mention, using existing music means getting clearance to do so (again, way outside of the scope of the composer on a production like this).  Not only that, but there were plenty of rumblings about issues behind the scenes for the production of Kenobi, especially regarding the score.  So don‚Äôt attack Holt over you not liking the choices that were made; it likely wasn‚Äôt ever her choice, and she‚Äôs a very competent composer who was in a bad position for this show no matter what.*  

&gt;!Back to it.  Up until the finale, no episodes had fully used any of the preexisting Star Wars themes for the series.  Some themes were certainly hinted at, particularly some material having an Imperial or Rebel leaning to them, but the themes were never directly quoted, even when they probably should have been as there were a number of scenes that really would have benefitted from The Force Theme and the Imperial March.  The show has been heavily reliant on the Kenobi theme that Williams wrote for the show, as well as a few new themes written by Holt for the show (Leia, Inquisitors, etc.).  !&lt;

&gt;!As the time went on, the themes became ever so slightly more present.  The opening of the finale was still going that route, with a modified version of some OT material.  And then we finally got three of the preexisting themes actually quoted fully in the final moments of resoution: Darth Vader‚Äôs theme, Leia‚Äôs theme, and the Force Theme.  This finally shows that their omission wasn‚Äôt somehow a glaring issue that had been overlooked, rather, a conscious choice.  !&lt;

&gt;!I can generally understand the justification for why we get them when we do.  We get Vader‚Äôs theme once he‚Äôs truly, fully, become Vader.  He‚Äôs no longer consumed by Kenobi, the last thing tying him to Anakin.  We get Leia‚Äôs theme when Kenobi finally sees her as more than just a little girl, but as the Princess Leia Organa.  And the Force theme is used when Kenobi has truly accepted his use of the force and realized he doesn‚Äôt need to be cutting himself off from it.  He finally means it when he says ‚Äúmay the force be with you‚Äù, and his ties to the force have finally been deepened instead of lessened.  !&lt;

&gt;!The impact of those themes in those moments was very strong, especially because of the lack of them previously.  It‚Äôs a bold move, especially for Star Wars, to take this approach.  I‚Äôm honestly still on the fence about if I really like it.  I‚Äôm a HUGE fan of the overly-thematic approach that Star Wars usually has and it‚Äôs truly my first love within film music.  A huge part of me wishes that the show had been using all of the legacy Star Wars themes from the outset and stuck to a John Williams-esque style of writing throughout.  But a part of me also appreciates that they‚Äôre trying new things and are working to move past being merely one version of Star Wars.  The future of Star Wars only exists if they‚Äôre willing to go outside the box and tell new stories in new ways in the universe, and this is a small part of that.  !&lt;

&gt;!Really, my biggest issues with the series are just that they didn‚Äôt bring in more legacy themes in the final episode specifically.  Qui-Gon‚Äôs theme should have appeared when he did.  Palpatine‚Äôs theme probably should have been used when he had his moment.  I would have loved a light, childlike, woodwind rendition of the main theme/Luke‚Äôs theme when Obi-Wan and Luke formally meet.  !&lt;

&gt;!The most grievous omission was not using Anakin vs. Obi-Wan when they dueled in this episode.  I‚Äôve seen some fantastic edits of the scene on this subreddit and that‚Äôs what I wish we had gotten.  Had that moment been the first time we got preexisting themes in their fullness‚Ä¶the impact of that could honestly not be overstated.  It would have been phenomenal.  Instead we got a very mediocre piece that has faint echoes of the ideas in Anakin vs. Obi-wan, which was disappointing.  In that moment it should have been all or nothing‚Ä¶having gone the silent route would have been better than what we got.  !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!I‚Äôve really only heard discourse around the score prior to the finale, and like I said, it was mostly negative.  I‚Äôm really curious about people‚Äôs thoughts now that their approach has been fully revealed and makes sense.  Do you like that they pushed back the use of the themes until the end?  Do you wish they hadn‚Äôt used any of them?  Did you want more of them in the end, like I did?  !&lt;",StarWars,[Spoiler] Kenobi‚Äôs approach to score was delayed gratification‚Ä¶but did it work?

1656119493,"One thing that was always clear in the original movie is that Obi-Wan never intended to win the fight against Vader. He wanted to become one with the force like Qui-Gon taught him to both inspire Luke to become a Jedi and to become more powerful than Vader could possibly imagine. In both Episode 3 and The Kenobi Show, we see Kenobi beat Vader multiple times, only losing 1 fight due to his fear and regret.

 The question is, could Kenobi have beaten Vader again on the Death Star if that was his goal? Obi-Wan wouldn't have stood a chance against Palpatine so it wouldn't have been a good plan and as we see, Kenobi did succeed in making Luke a great Jedi. In a proper fight to the death, would Kenobi still have enough edge to win against Vader or would Vader have gotten over his emotional imbalance and beaten Kenobi?",StarWars,Could Obi-Wan have beaten Vader in A New Hope?

1656117171,"Hear me out; I know we got the perfect Vader fix in Kenobi. I just feel like seeing Vader create his boogeyman persona in the 10 years leading up to Kenobi in a ""Vader"" series would be incredible.

Hayden is perfect for it and it wouldn't need to show Vader all that much so much as the aftermath of his presence while hunting Obi-Wan and other Jedis.

Almost like The Punisher meets Darth Vader. Fueling his rage after the death of Padme and betrayal by his best friend, he becomes the epitome of fear to all that oppose him as no one truly gets to live after seeing him.

It could even really just focus on him building up his Inquisitors force and their assaults on various Jedi in hiding. When things get out of hand for the inquisitors, Vader ""dark hallways"" their ass.

I know this seems like the ramblings of a lunatic but I feel like there is a good opportunity to show his story as truly killing Anakin over time, giving into all of his fear, anger, and hate, and taking it out on (at first) unsuspecting individuals. 

I dunno.  I think it could be really well done, while not over using Vader and diminishing his looming, boogeyman reputation.

However going back and looking at George Lucas's statements on the Rule of Two it seems like he intended it to be a more organic thing that formed out of necessity rather than some sith lord intentionally founding it. 

""Every time you get two sith together you have the master, you have the apprentice and the apprentice is always trying to recruit another apprentice to join with him to kill the master""

(Spoilers) This is for the record. Mandalorian s1 was great fun but had some noteworthy writing mistakes. Mandalorian s2 had much more substantial mistakes but was still overall enjoyable. Boba Fett had such significant problems not only in the writing but also the directing that it became cringeworthy and unenjoyable, and Kenobi has gotten inexcusably bad, but everyone has BLINDED themselves to objective terrible writing and directing because ‚Äúits star wars.‚Äù When you refuse to critique writing and directing teams and shovel money down their throats no matter what even as the quality continues to degrade, they will stop caring and give you anything with no effort and that is what has happened here. This will probably fall on deaf ears, but someone has to be the first just go through and point out the ALL the failures. So here it is everything the writers and directors did wrong with Kenobi, and even if you still liked the show, think back on it after you read these and really ask yourselves if your opinion hasn‚Äôt nudged at all. There are good, even great things in this show, but they are buried beneath a mountain of effortless garbage.

PART: 1 (the least offender, by far)

¬∑ The notion that the inquisition and Third Sister just happens to encounter the 1 guy on the entire planet in Owen, who happens to be fathering a force sensitive by sheer chance- and which will become incredibly important knowledge by part 6 is a pretty massive suspension of disbelief. Third sister is also established as so evil and goal driven that she will cut off civilians‚Äô hands for the slightest of back talk, which really does not wash with her character later being to revealed to have been forced into service to survive and seek revenge for her murdered jedi friends. 

¬∑ The Leia chase scene: Talked about to death, I know, but baffling that the directors did this. The notion that a 10 year old girl can outrun full grown adults as portrayed here assisted by cutaways is absurd to watch. It is so impossible that one of the henchmen actors can be seen running at an angled stride just so he can‚Äôt overtake her. This was not one of the more consequential failures but a red flag that shows the directors are so blind to failures of quality. It should be noted- and this is a trend- there may be some ways a director could make this work-but they did not here, and it looks terrible.

¬∑ The inquisitors catch and hang the Rogue Jedi but later we find out that they entomb their murdered Jedi victims in Amber at the Fortress Inquisitorius. Why they did not do that with this guy is unknown and the audience is left with nothing but conjecture. Also, the stringing him up by the arms to make it kid friendly is awkwardly handled and looks weird.

Part 2 (things fall apart)

¬∑ Kenobi walking around in a Jedi Robe seems incredibly inconspicuous and a poor decision for an actual jedi trying to stay under the radar. 

¬∑ Kenobi makes clear that he is looking for ‚Äúhis daughter‚Äù ‚Äúsomewhere on the planet‚Äù and that he cannot track the ship. He then finds her because he finds a bottom feeder who directs him to the ‚Äúsewers‚Äù where apparently very nasty people are. This terribly done writing. The staff simply did not bother to devote any time to establishing a believable or compelling chain of events for how Kenobi is able to locate Leia, so they just did this and he miraculously finds her across an entire planet. This screams of the show needing another episode but not getting it.

¬∑ This episode clearly establishes Leia as a prodigy. She makes an insane leap in logic based on very limited information to determine that the man sent to rescue her is the reason she was kidnapped- to get to him, all just by seeing his wanted poster. However, at the same time, she is asking him to make her float in public and showing almost no regard for the fact that she was just kidnapped. These don‚Äôt mix, it makes her look bipolar and her ‚Äúserious side‚Äù is beginning to become a but cringey. Making a 10 year old a serious natured character in live action is really hard, I will openly admit, and the writing and directing staff is just not up to the task.

¬∑ Reva kidnaps Leia on a hunch to draw out Kenobi which proves to work. This based on a connection found between Organa and Kenobi in the archives, apparently betting Organa will turn to him. This implies, frankly would require, communication between Organa and Kenobi, which the empire now knows. This screws with continuity. How can Organa not be arrested for conspiring with a jedi? 

¬∑ The Reva is ‚Äúfrom the Gutter‚Äù stuff is weird because we later learn she came from the temple. Vader is shown to have known this from the beginning in part 5 and surely her identity is known. As seen later the inquisitors not only have access to Jedi archives but immortalize their kills in amber including those killed in order 66 (see the youngling), so they could easily deduce that she was missing. Then why is she treated as ‚Äúthe least of them‚Äù cus shes from the gutter? The grand inquisitor has her same origin, he was a temple guard, as shown in rebels. Kenobi says that a lot of the inquisitors are ex-jedi in this very series.  Are they basing this off the location they found her at? This is so strange in retrospect.

¬∑ Leia chase scene part 2: absurd, nonsensical forced solely to move the plot forward, abysmally directed. There is a section where kenobi‚Äôs friggin fingernails are touching her but he just choses not to pick her up cus the chase needed to continue- I was baffled that they left this in the cut.

¬∑ The grand inquisitor stopping Reva from catching Kenobi when he is 5 feet away is hilariously contrived. ‚ÄúThis is how its done‚Äù as he is about to do same thing she was about to. 

¬∑ The stabbing itself, has gotten a lot of heat. The motivation is fine for Reva, the arbitrary decision of whether a lightsaber impaling you is instantly fatal, like with Qui-Gon and many Clone Wars Jedi, but survivable when the plot needs it to happen is contrived. I believe its possible, imperial troops could have saved the Grand Inquisitor, but then why wasn‚Äôt Reva outed, were they just punking her the whole time‚Ä¶surely they could have taken the same actions she did to pursue Kenobi from here, they didn‚Äôt need her.

¬∑ Finally, Reva‚Äôs rageful screaming at Kenobi about how Vader will get him is out of character because Reva is revealed to hate Vader.

Part 3: (The Elements Bend)

¬∑ When they arrive at the checkpoint Kenobi is found out, he takes out the probe droid and 4 or 5 stormtroopers with just his blaster. During the fight Kenobi uses the guy that drove him there as a human shield, why? Because he supports the Empire and asked the troopers to check out some dudes he thought were suspicious. This is one is more opinionated but this came off as really out of character for Kenobi to me, this guy is objectively pretty innocent being pro regime alone does not warrant being used as a meat shield.

¬∑ Kenobi then shoots the laser fence instead of simply walking around it. This is fine. It does not matter. He‚Äôs in a rush‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why everyone jumps on this‚Ä¶. what isn‚Äôt fine is what happens next. A small transport finds Kenobi and Leia, 3 stormtroopers get out after Kenobi just killed 5 combatants and Kenobi surrenders. Kenobi has also been made at this point there is no reason for him not to break out the lightsaber, so its even more weird that he doesn‚Äôt fight them. Upon surrendering he gets on the ground THE GUN REMAINS IN HIS HAND THE ENTIRE TIME IN PLAIN VIEW and its somehow never addressed‚Ä¶ All of this is horrible to behold on screen.

¬∑  Vader‚Äôs first encounter with Kenobi really feels like it lacks the gravity it should, Kenobi does everything he can to run, dialogue is limited to a few brief generic lines and the lightsaber choreography is very poor. They try to make it look easy for Vader by doing everything one-handed, including blocks and saber bashes but it just doesn‚Äôt look good. 

¬∑ I‚Äôm fine with the premise that Kenobi is weak and his force ability atrophied from lack of use, but at the same time, he has to train Luke, why would he allow his abilities to degrade? In this very series he approaches Owen about training Luke even as a boy, so its an odd choice.

¬∑ Kenobi‚Äôs force wall is broken and he is dragged through fire face first. He is not horrifically scarred and emerges with only burns on his arm. His clothes do not catch on fire and he does not ignite. Fire as an entity has been bent to the writers-director‚Äôs will. 

¬∑ Vader extinguishes the flames with the force, bizarrely has a trooper fetch Kenobi instead of him picking him up again, and Talia intervenes igniting the blaze more so than before. Not only does Vader not use the force to extinguish the flames again, but he does not stop the loader droid from escaping with Kenobi, he stares blankly on. The fire can be justified by it being a bigger blaze this time if you stretch it. Not stopping the droid is a plot hole. In part 5 Vader halts an entire escaping ship that must the size of a light corvette and rips it to pieces from a distance. But he can‚Äôt use the force on the droid meters away? What is he Sandor Clegane, does fire give him Mustafar flashbacks, when there is just a little bit too much of it? Inexcusable. Vader is rendered an idiot.

¬∑ At the end of the episode Leia who has been running through the same tunnel that Reva entered way after her runs into Reva ahead of her who has already killed Leia‚Äôs pilot. The laws of physical space have bent to the writer-director‚Äôs will. Reva entered from the same village and the exact same doorway as Leia, there are multiple shots blatantly establishing its same door behind the same rack, we have no reason to believe that Leia took some kind of longer path or if there is even more than one path- and if there was, why didn‚Äôt Talia send her on that path? Reva is just ahead of her and also didn‚Äôt run into Talia on her way back. There is no explanation for any of this. The audience is left completely confused, its criminally bad writing.",StarWars,Everything Wrong with Kenobi (1/2)

Greetings, exhalted ones. I come to you simply to talk to you all, about star wars itself. Not from one side, one perspective, one viewpoint. Just. Talk. 

We are all divided. That is clear to say, it is within human nature to have opinions and we are geared to stick close to those who agree and oppose those who do not, however this division is bringing great disaster to our community. Let me first discuss the elephant in the room. Trilogies. All three trilogies have their fans, and their haters, however we all forget that it is still STAR WARS. No matter the era, it is still the same title which should bring us together. It does not matter whether you grew up with the beginning, discovering the same of skywalker, hearing of the empire and watching luke's journey to defeat the empire and save his father. It does not matter whether you grew up seeing the height of the republic, fall to ashes at the hands of a broken man, promised so much more. It does not matter whether you grew up viewing a journey of self discovery of a girl who is a tie to a long past turmoil.

It does not matter what trilogy you grew up with. Or which you like the best. We should all be united under feelings. The feeling of amazement seeing the first ignition of a lightsaber. The fear of the main villains being utterly badass and complex characters in themselves. The feeling that you yourself is growing along side these characters, learning lessons about yourself whilst you view (I know I have). I am not a blind viewer, being a devoted member of the star wars fandom I am aware of the hate and downsides of every piece of star wars. Yes it is true that the sequels may have written their main character not as the fans would've liked, or written the character of luke against his morals, or 'invalidated vaders sacrifice'. But the OT and PT made mistakes too. The prequels were also criticised because of their bad writing, and continuity buffers they created with the introduction of the clone wars series. The originals whilst limited by their time were critized because of these continuity buffers that not everything lines up, but they cannot help that. They can't change an already decades old treasured movie. 

Star wars is complicated. Not everyone will agree on any given thing. But do not hate others for simply being of a different time period. Those born to witness the originals in theatres would see the  Birth of star wars. And they are so lucky to have seen that. The reveal of lukes father is a twist like none other in cinema. But that does not mean any star wars content after that 'isn't star wars'. Star wars has evolved into more than just the skywalker saga. And those who prefer the originals. Please, just view the franchise for all it has become. Both the highs and the lows. Look at the tributes to the originals in every piece of works. Look at how from your single trilogy, so much has sparked from it. Its truly magical and you should be sharing those feelings with those around you.

Those of you like myself who were of an Age to come into the franchise with the prequels, and later discover the original trilogy. We had more to view up front than our predecessors. We got the view the republic. Anakins rise and fall, the becoming of vader and the rise of sidious. We saw star wars, through the perspective those before us couldn't for the first time. But because of the technology difference, or the storyline, we should not compare ourselves. We had so much more to base the trilogy off of because star wars 4-6 was already written. There was an already established universe to explore the history of. And my god did they make that history packed with some of the greatest content in its history. But we are no better than the originals. Or the dark horse people turn away from.

Which brings me to the sequels. Disney's crack at star wars. Yes it was more 'kid friendly', there was alot of fan service to draw people in and many plots and characters either felt empty, or incorrect. But we should not hold that against them. They had to balance introducing the new generation to the amazing franchise we've been apart of, whilst also catering to us at the same time. It was certainly possible and I'm not giving them a scapegoat. But what they created still opened the doors for the new generation to explore star wars at their own pace. The OT, PT and clone wars, rebels, etc had all been put in place; they had an encyclopedia of content to view. For them, the sequels was a story of good vs evil, but told from the perspective of a young blood, introduced to characters that we as veterans know the stories of, but the new audience didn't. The 'fan service' to us, only heightened the interest of the new audience to delve deeper into star wars. 

And thats what I find beautiful about star wars. No matter its highs or lows. Its all connected. In a way, no one's ever really gone.there is no piece of content which will make us feel like this isn't what we know as star wars.every franchise may have movies that some do not like. But what are we doing hating eachother over it? For crying out loud people we are all the same side of a coin. It should be us standing together in unison embracing the love for our community. Not tearing it down to the ashes to defend which character beats who or which film is the best. From my point of view. We can be so much more.

Star wars will not be perfect. We all want the story to play how we see it. There is so much to explore as a 'what if' hypothetical that no one will truly be satisfied. But we do not need to fight eachother over it. You can sit here and read my post and down vote, or ignore it, or comment that I am completely out of my mind. And you are within your right to do so. But for those who take the time to read this. Please, give others the patience and freedom to enjoy what they want, even if you may not. You both belong to a community of some of the best people I have ever met. And certainly best franchises. You may not see a difference because at the end of the day we are only singular people. The hate and the divide will speak louder thsn our actions no matter what we do. But I haven't and will not stop attempting to unite the people of this franchise, even if it is to no avail, so long as I can change one person's opinion, my journey will have been a success.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Either he will die or I will, Master‚Ä¶‚Äù I feel like that was him accepting that killing Vader is the only way, which echos later on when he tells Luke there is no winning this if Vader doesn‚Äôt die.

But here‚Äôs the main thing I wanted to see what all of you thought/think.

Did Obi leave him alive because ‚Äú‚Ä¶a Jedi‚Äôs role is to defend life, not take it‚Ä¶‚Äù and he was saving Anakin‚Äôs life? Knowing that his hope in Anakin‚Äôs children comes from the Force and he must trust they will redeem him? 

But then why did he say, ‚Äúthen my friend is truly, dead‚Äù‚Ä¶ was that just some fan-service to rhyme with ‚Äúthen my father is truly dead‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Did he see the blue of Anakin‚Äôs eye and think, ‚Äúthere he is‚Ä¶‚Äù and then when Vader came back to say the whole ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not your failure Obi-Wan‚Ä¶‚Äù did he (Obi) fully realize how pathetic Vader actually is, intuitively knowing his end was inevitable, and the only way to redeem Anakin is to allow his children to ‚Äúkill‚Äù Vader. That line of thinking kinda falls in line with Obi‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Ä¶from a certain point of view‚Ä¶‚Äù outlook.

I guess I‚Äôm just struggling with that theory because of the dialogue throughout the episode.

In the series finale, Obi-Wan destroys the left side of Vader's helmet, revealing the left portion of what used to be Anakin. In Rebels, it is reversed, with Ahsoka damaging the right side of the helmet and revealing the remnants of Anakin on that side. Neither character was successful in a literal sense of reaching Anakin based on their past relationship and bringing him back into the light. Both duals end in the ""Vader"" persona remaining firmly in control, despite Anakin's past ties to both characters who damage the helmet to reveal the literal and figurative split in identity. 

However, it takes Luke, Vader's own blood and one of Anakin's last connections to Padme aside from Leia, to fully remove the helmet both literally and figuratively, restoring Anakin's identity through redemption and finally eliminating the Vader persona entirely. Whether intentional or not, it plays well into Anakin/Vader's duality and the theme of familial redemption.

The OT duels work because they are built on strong emotion and feel climactic and exciting, but the choreography just hasn‚Äôt aged too well. The prequels, while usually stunning looking, are perhaps a little TOO over-choreographed, and a lot of the duels don‚Äôt have the powerful emotion behind them that the OT did (excluding Anakin v. Obi-Wan, of course). But the ST has the best of both worlds: beautiful visuals, emotional tension, high stakes, and the perfect balance between simplistic and overdone choreo. Technology advancing also definitely is a bonus here, but just the SOUNDS of the lightsabers are so pure and almost magical feeling. I understand a lot of the criticisms of the sequels, but I will never understand the hatred of the lightsaber battles. To me, they‚Äôre probably the most brilliant parts of the movies.",StarWars,I‚Äôll say it‚Äî the sequel trilogy has the best lightsaber duels.

My argument is that yes he knew that Anakin became Vader, but most of the galaxy didn't know that Vader existed. He was even just a rumor amongst the imperials. Vader was Palpatine's secretish enforcer. Obi-Wan lived in isolation. He cut himself off from the outside world. He knew little to nothing of the outside goings on beyond Tatooine. 

What he was surprised about wasn't that he was Vader. It was that he was still alive. He left him for dead and had no knowledge of his survival and transformation.

So, i want to buy a lightsaber for training/combat purposes, i have see pages like ultrasaber or arms at fire(i really liked the design of the temple guard) but for ultrasaber i have readed really bad commentaries and for arms at fire i heard that they cost more than $900 and thats is really expensive to me, really really expensive, so, after a full day of search i have come here to ask wich place is the best or what are you preferences.

I don't have any problem with the price, except if it is more than $600(talking on USD) thats something i just can't afford for a lightsaber.

I don't have any problem too if it doesnt have good sound at all, i just want one that is durable and designed for fights(lose 500 dollars in less than 2 or 5 months is really gonna be hard for me, haha)

With Hayden Christensen back in the fold and Ewan McGregor.

I know this sounds crazy, but c'mon we all dreamed of it.

We need a timeline in the future where an unbeatable Sith Lord emerges, or an enemy that simply cannot be beaten by the Jedi of that time whether that be Rey or in the future. A super strong villain that is 5x stringer than Palpatine and Vader.

Therefore the council heads a research mission where they discover how to travel fast enough to go back in time but somehow there's a plot where they can only do it twice.

So what they do is they go back in time to pick up a Jedi or two that can potentially help them defeat the powerful Sith Lord.
And I'm talking super strong .

So they pick up Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi from their timeline, tell them about the situation, train them for 3-4 years so they reach their maximum potential , and we get a trilogy of Anakin Skywalker at his max potential .

After defeating this enemy they are returned to their timelines and the time traveling recipe or spacecraft is lost forever.

1656091933,"I‚Äôve not been a fan of the show, I have like bits very tiny bits, but for the most part I think the show was just an idea, executed extremely bad‚Ä¶ extremely bad.

I don‚Äôt blame any of the cast, I think they did an amazing job with the lazy script they were given, I liked the actors, and Ewan McGregor slays his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi just like he did in the prequels.

I just don‚Äôt get why Obi-Wan didn‚Äôt finish Vader right there and then. He let him alive so he could break havoc across the galaxy.

And why‚Ä¶ So that Luke or Leia could kill their father because that was their destiny!!!

Think about it, that is so messed up from the part of the writers, so messed up specially since he had already won.

The first time Obi-Wan defeated Vader I get why he left him alive, he had already won, Anakin was dying, he didn‚Äôt want to be the one to kill his brother so he left him to die there, but he didn‚Äôt. I really understand why Anakin lived and fully embrace Vader.

But the second time around. Obi-Wan had the upper hand, Vader was at his mercy, but he didn‚Äôt strike why? Because he was his friend, his brother. He said ‚Äúgoodbye Vader‚Äù‚Ä¶ Vader! That‚Äôs an acknowledgement that all their ties are severed, so why did he live? So one of his children could kill him.

The fact that he didn‚Äôt killed Vader because it was the destiny of his children to do it goes AGAINST everything that Obi-Wan stands for and all that he is.

After 10 years and a second confrontation, if Vader had won, in a not so easy yet espectacular way and Obi-Wan had no choice but to run, and eventually train Luke and Leia because by that point he wasn‚Äôt a match for Vader anymore, that I get, that‚Äôs a premise I can get behind.

1656090792,"Hear me out, before you throw tomatoes at me. I don't really post but I need somewhere to post my thoughts on this series. Long post ahead.

I just did a second viewing of the finale and on my first viewing, there was something that didn't sit right with me during their battle, and it's the part where Vader buries Obi-wan alive with a ton of rocks. I had the same question as everyone else, why the frick didn't Vader just stab him instead of this roundabout way of killing him?

Then it hit me: Obi-wan is literally, physically and metaphorically being crushed by his guilt and past.

During this scene, what replays in his head is the voices of Anakin and Vader overlaying with each other. In the past episodes, Obi-wan seems to have lost hope in anything and is wracked by guilt, regrets, and grief. It's why he turned away that Jedi in the first episode, why he didn't fight for the man with a family and why he rejected Bail in rescuing Leia. He has also lost faith in people (not trusting Haja) and just a generally downtrodden person. He even lost faith in the force and has not used it in ten years. It's like being an artist and not painting, or a violinist and not playing the violin. Heck, you can say it's like not using your arms because the Force has always been there as an extension of himself. He buried his lightsaber in the sand, which he always said is ""his life"", which means he himself has buried HIM in the sand. He doesn't like the name Obi-wan, he uses Ben (it's why it was so important for Leia to use the name Obi-wan during the finale, but correct me if I'm wrong here). For him, the ""war is over"" and the ""fight is done"". He tells Nari to bury his lightsaber in the sand which is to turn his back on everything they've fought for because that's exactly what he did. This is not Obi-wan Kenobi, the Jedi. This is Ben, who is no one. There is no hope in the future, and certainly no hope for himself, because ""he's not the man he used to be"". 

Anyone who has ever experienced mental health issues and depression, these words sound very familiar. 

Depression, PTSD, grief and trauma warps you to the point you lose yourself and your life. Considering what Obi-wan has been through, can we really blame him? Every part of the galaxy is just another living reminder of what he lost and why it's his fault and how he failed. When he wakes up, the ache is renewed. He's not just grieving Anakin, the Jedi, Padme, his life - he's also grieving himself, who he used to be. Because when he we see him at Episode 1, he's but a shell of a broken man.

Aside from depression and hopelessness, avoidance is another symptom of PTSD. He makes Luke as his excuse, but there is no reason for him to just sit in the sand for 10 years, let himself rot away except to atone for his supposed sins. He disavowed his name, his lightsaber, his clothes, and his Jedi principles, the fricking Force. He's been avoiding everything and anything because it just hurts him, until the past literally hits him in the face. When Obi-wan faces Darth Vader for the first time (special shoutout to him having an almost heart attack for simply feeling the presence of someone you thought dead for ten years), it's laughable how he just runs. He just keeps running from Vader, until the ghost of his past literally catches up to him. 

The reason why he loses this fight is because he has nothing to fight for; not even Leia, not even Tala, not even the Path. Because people cannot save you, you yourself have to *choose* to save yourself.

I agree some parts feel lackluster, but people just don't get it. 

This show is not about us, it's about Obi-wan and his emotional journey. It's about healing and how one can move on from such unimaginable loss. 

In a way, its also about how one can fight trauma, PTSD, depression and grief. 

On his own, Obi-wan failed. He thought by locking himself away in some tower he can heal, or he doesn't deserve to have a life after everything he did. It's only through his emotional growth with Leia, Tala, Roken, the Path people and even Reva did he finally heal from the loss of Anakin, the Jedi, and his perceived failures.  Leia showed him love and hope. Tala showed him that even if we did terrible things in the past, we can still and *must* do something to make that right. The Path showed him that the Jedi spiritually and the fight is alive and well, and all of these people showed him that he is not alone nor powerless or helpless, unlike what his mind has been telling him (The disconnect between the mind and reality is important in mental health).

Heck, say all you want about Reva, but she is the perfect foil for Obi-wan. Reva carried herself from the gutter to killing Vader, because she thought revenge and vengeance will what make everything better, will what make her heal from her traumatic past. But when she finally had Luke in her hands, it didn't. She realized she will not heal by killing Luke. She is only killing herself. She can only heal by honoring them, and living for herself. That's the only way to move on.

So let's go back to this scene:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*crushed by rocks obito style\*](https://preview.redd.it/eal9qruckl791.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4edd164fb199a09a61b507d37f4b5ae9de762f1c)

This time, he is not just in a metaphorical hole, he IS in a hole. Everyone who's ever been depressed or been through something traumatic, a common metaphor would be like you're trapped in a hole you cannot ever climb out of, endlessly falling and crushed. So what does Obi-wan do in this scenario?

Instead of Anakin, he hears Luke and Leia. This moment is important, because he *chooses* to save himself and fight for the future. If we put Episode 1 Obi-wan here, he would have just let himself be crushed, but because of his six episodic journey, this Obi-wan fights and saves himself. The next shot we see him literally crawl out this depression and confront the living manifestation of his deepest fears, regret and guilt; the phantom of his past - Vader. 

*And WINS.*

More to this, is that he overcomes his crushing (heh) guilt and past because of his love for Luke and Leia, because now, he has hope on the future. He believes in them. He fights for them. The past, Anakin, no longer matters. Luke and Leia is his new hope. At the end of the day, after devastating loss, we find something and someone new to fight for. That's how you heal.

Let's also talk about Vader for a sec. Vader literally wants to bury Obi-wan, also a living manifestation of his past, because that's what he wants to do in his mind. He wants to bury all traces of Anakin Skywalker. But of course it doesn't work. The Dark Side isn't exactly known for mental health seminars.

It's arguable whether this is Vader or Anakin, but I think it's Anakin that absolves him of his guilt. Vader at the end of the day, is Anakin. For me, this is Anakin, because Anakin is essentially saying, ""you didn't fail me, I failed myself. You were the best Master ever 10/10 I simply made my own choices"" in Vader style.  He's comforting him in his own way.

Only through Obi-wan confronting himself and Vader was he able to help Reva, and now, they are ""both free"" of the past. Later, we see Obi-wan smiling, laughing, hugging, reclaiming both Ben and Obi-wan, remembering Anakin and Padme without hurting and regaining his sense of self. It's beautiful to see. One of my favorite shots is this: 

&amp;#x200B;

Because it's just so dang hopeful. Obi-wan finally mentally and physically leaves this dark place so he can finally move on in the new stage of his life. That's why he was only now able to commune with Qui-Gon, because he's finally healing. And we love that for him. If Obi-wan can do it, after literally losing everything, we can too. 

TLDR; Obi-wan Kenobi series is about mental health and connects depressed Obi-wan with sagely Obi-wan in New Hope

1656089929,"I recently rewatched the OT and I really don't understand how the 'stormtroopers always miss' stigma comes from. To prove my point, in A New Hope, the Imperial forces decimate the rebels on the Tantive IV, kill Lukes caretakers, and kill many jawas (albeit offscreen). They miss during the swinging scene with Luke and Leia, but that makes perfect sense. Hitting an object moving through the sky is very difficult, and the stormtroopers only \*narrowly\* miss their shots. 

In The Empire Strikes Back, they win the Battle of Hoth and miss occasionally during the chase but once again there was not only moving targets but also residents of Cloud City fighting back, plus abundant cover for our heroes.

In Return of the Jedi, although the Empire seems to be losing to the Ewoks, they still manage to turn the battle around until the second Death Star is destroyed and moral is understandably lost.  ([Here's a clip of proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKj9VGWyjBQ), go to 3:23 for the Imperial turnaround) Even before the Empire begins slaughtering the Ewoks they still manage to corner and pin down Leia and Han before the intervention of a rebel controlled AT-ST.

Rogue One is probably the biggest proof of the accuracy of the Empire's troops, as they slaughter the rebels at both Jedha and the Battle of Scarif. Both ended in massive rebel losses.

1656089439,"I remember when my friends and I heard that Episode one was coming. It must have been 1997 or 1998 when we heard. I was 21 at the time and we talked nonstop about what the new trilogy would include.  
  
Immediately we thought of The Clone Wars being a major part of all three movies. Obi-Wan and Anakin being contemporaries, the same age, fighting alongside each other. I envisioned that because all three movies would be set during The Clone Wars, that the toll of war itself would have slowly damaged Anakin's body where he got an arm replaced, a new knee joint, and slowly he began to feel that mechanical parts were better than organic parts because they increased his strength and speed, until one battle left him needing a respirator. The increased oxygen in his blood gave him a continual rush, making him even more reckless than ever.  
  
My best friend had his own theory, which I kind of like better. Independent of the friendship between Obi-wan and Anakin, somewhere in the story, Anakin succumbs to some sort of flesh eating bacteria that cannot be stopped. Again, limbs and organs are slowly replaced with mech, and his mind starts to grow twisted and angry with the world. *And* this would have played into what Obi-wan told Luke in ROTJ that Vader was more machine than man: Obi-wan would have known of the disease and it's ongoing toll on his body.

1656087932,"I keep seeing posts discussing what exactly Reva‚Äôs motivations were in the last episode and most people have come to the conclusion that she wanted to kill Vader‚Äôs son as revenge. 

While the episode doesn‚Äôt outright say that this is true it does hint at it with her saying she wants ‚Äújustice‚Äù and that killing Luke is that justice. 

I really hope this isn‚Äôt the case because the mental gymnastics she‚Äôd have to do to come to this conclusion is ridiculous. 

If order for her to figure out Luke is Anakin‚Äôs son she‚Äôd have to 

1. Know that Anakin was in a relationship with someone- something that she would know is directly prohibited for the Jedi. 

2. That his partner was pregnant. Something that almost no one knew at all. I believe only Anakin, Padme, and maybe Palpatine knew. Obi-wan only found out after Anakin had turned. 

3. That Padme‚Äôs child(ren) did not die with their mother. The only people who knew the kids survived the pregnancy were Kenobi, Yoda, the Lars, and the Organas. 

Not to mention that Reva was a child during all of these events living at the Jedi temple. 

I know people will argue that she could‚Äôve pieced it together after listening to Bail‚Äôs message but she simply doesn‚Äôt have enough pieces of the puzzle.

What Reva does know by the finale is 

1. Leia isn‚Äôt an Organa and she may be force sensitive 

2. Kenobi is working with Organa and the Path 

3. Both Kenobi and Bail are working with the Lars on Tatooine to hide Luke 

The most logical conclusion to draw from this is that Luke is simply just a force sensitive child that Kenobi is trying to keep safe. Which adds up considering Reva sees Kenobi working with the Path the entire series.

Coincidentally, I've got my original toy Han Solo blaster sitting next to me right now because my friend is 3D printing replacement battery cover knobs for it.

Having seen the original Star Wars in the theater multiple times as a kid it was difficult, to say the least, to fully accept the prequels as part and parcel of that mythology. Yes, I liked the prequels, but I never loved them. They were just too different in tone, too uneven in pacing and too predictable in general. The fall was preordained and yet something was missing. The link between Episode III and IV was tenuous at best. Lucas' reveal of Vader at the end of Episode III is unsatisfying at best. Obi-Wan Kenobi the series fixes that, but it also does a lot more.

# How do we get to the Obi-Wan in Episode IV?

In the opening of the series we find Kenobi a broken man. This man led massive armies into battle. He soundly defeated Anakin Skywalker in his prime. In single combat he killed General Grievous, a foe that had slain multiple Jedi in battle. Now we see he has been living for a decade with the trauma of killing his friend and it has broken him. He hasn't touched the Force in a long time. He does drudge work and watches Luke from afar, never having met the boy. He cowers when his discovery is likely. When he first encounters Vader, he is easily brought down.

How does this man, broken and beaten, become the person that takes Darth Maul down in Rebels, economically and easily with one quick strike. How does he become the cool, calm and collected presence in Episode IV that battles Vader to a standstill?

Kenobi has to care again, to confront his demons, to realize it's not all about his pain, that there are others suffering for and because of him. He has to find absolution and in confronting Vader he does.

# Vader is not even a challenge

It's a given that Kenobi survives this series, we know that, but what a shocking domination of Vader in the final episode. Kenobi is never really at a disadvantage. He harries Vader at every turn. Even when Vader seems to get one up on him and buries him under rubble we find Obi-Wan unhurt. As memories of his two charges run through his mind we can hear Yoda's voice, ""Size matters not"" before he hurls the rubble away with relative ease and bounds up and out of the hole. This is Obi-Wan returned to his full powers and perhaps more.

Watching this Obi-Wan battle Vader is what finally puts the confrontations in Episode III and IV into context with each other. Vader is revealed for what he is, a broken man, his powers diminished by his injuries. We understand now that he could never have defeated the most powerful Jedi of the Republic on his own as Vader. He liquidated the prime of the Jedi during the purge and never faces a real challenge afterward, until now.

# Episode III and IV come together through Christensen

Vader's words in this episode are Obi-Wan's final absolution.

""You didn't kill Anakin Skywalker... I did.""

This moment is what truly links Episodes III and IV and the main reason is the performance by Hayden Christensen. That he performed as Vader for the show without saying anything himself as Vader until this moment is what gives this scene so much power. 

Hearing Hayden's voice instead of James Earl Jones' and seeing Hayden's face behind that mask lit by the red light of his saber creates the first real nostalgia for the prequels for many older fans of Star Wars by firmly tying Episode III and IV together. Christensen expresses in one small scene how far the character has come from those films. We still see that innocent and impetuous young man behind the scars and when we see how resigned he is to his fate we truly understand why Vader is what he is in Episode IV and beyond. Christensen makes all of the movies better with this scene.

# Obi-Wan in Episode IV

We now know that Obi-Wan was not going to lose to Vader in their duel in Episode IV. This show and Rebels show that Kenobi's skills remain potent. Perhaps with the passage of time they are an even match, but more likely Obi-Wan never intends to defeat Vader. He has spent over a decade conferring with Qui-Gon and Yoda on what needs to happen. If he takes down Vader the Emperor will just put another Sith in Vader's place. The opening to defeating the Emperor is through Vader's love for Padme and by extension the children.

# Final Thoughts

It's interesting to consider that Obi-Wan, by the time of Episode IV, has been in contact with Qui-Gon for a decade or more. What do they do in that time? I hope they make more Obi-Wan episodes that explore this.

Especially now, knowing that Obi-Wan for sure could commune Qui-Gon, why does it take three years after Obi-Wan enters the Force for Obi-Wan to point Luke to Dagobah? What are he and Qui-Gon and Yoda debating in that time?",StarWars,Obi-Wan Kenobi has done something I never thought was possible. It's made me love the prequels.
1656086264,"Episode 6 very much established his position within the Inquisitorial structure.  He is obviously subservient to Vader but is also almost in an advisory role not fearing to warn against Vader's immediate orders to follow Obi. More or less establishing that 

The grand inquisitor is intelligent

He works WITH Vader as a commander and not just someone he issues orders to. 

His demeanor while following Vader's orders shows that he disagrees with them but knows that once Vader says something twice you don't make him say it a 3rd time.

Vader respects him, his position, and his input

Even with his brief live action role, I think Kenobi did a great job really establishing the Grand Inquisitor as a powerful figure in the pre-rebellion era.",StarWars,I really dig the Grand Inquisitor's character in Kenobi.

___

One thing I loved about the final confrontation between Kenobi and Vader was the back and forth use of the force, both offensively and defensively. Which, makes sense. We should see Jedi/Sith/force sensitives utilize the force during battle. It's their greatest tool.

We should have ESPECIALLY seen it used by Rey and Kylo during the throne room fight in TLJ against NON force sensitive beings. It would have given them a clear advantage and made that 7 on 2 fight much more believable. Because as it stands, it makes little sense how the two would be able to defeat 7 highly trained guards wielding melee weapons via melee combat alone.


That's it, that's really all I had to say. I wish we saw the force used more often in battle like we did in Kenobi. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",StarWars,That scene in the last Obi Wan episode shows how the Praetorian fight in TLJ could've been made way more believable
1656085039,"I love that the Kenobi series focused on Ben‚Äôs relationship with Leia. It makes me look at her asking him for help in ANH with a larger smile on my face knowing the history they had.

Leia asks for Ben‚Äôs help but is taken to the Death Star, then Ben goes to disable to tractor beam instead of going to the detention level to meet her and the only glimpse she gets of her old friend is when he is fighting Vader and dies sacrificing himself. Obviously Lucas had no idea in 1977 that Star Wars would have expanded to this size now since that scene only focuses on Luke seeing Ben. But you can see Leia turn to look as well, and her saying ‚ÄúLuke it‚Äôs too late!‚Äù and comforting him later on the Falcon just hits even harder now.

A strong independent lead role, not a damsel in distress and had a compelling character arc that entwined with Kenobi really well. I think her performance will be an inspiration and act as role model for a lot of youth. 

As a sith inquisitor, she nailed the character and how it was portrayed. I thought her arc to the light side was authentic and immersive. 

She did not feel like a quota pick whatsoever and Disney did well this time to actually give her a lead position over the entire series rather than what happened with Finn (he could have been made to become a Jedi).

Well done Moses Ingram!",StarWars,"Reva, an appreciation post for the Kenoni series"
1656083168,"Note: This got long so I put a TLDR at the end. I hope at least one person enjoys reading this though.

Following the end of the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, I was inspired to rewatch the Prequels. While watching Episode II I was struck with this idea that I wanted to post for others to enjoy and give their opinions. I want to say first off that I‚Äôm not calling anyone who enjoyed Luke‚Äôs sequel arc the way it was wrong, we all have our own taste and that is a good thing.

That being said, I personally was a bit bummed out by Luke‚Äôs reason for going into exile, and my idea is a simple change in his reason for going that would have made it work for me and likely others without any additional alterations. A change that would fit perfectly within Star Wars canon. 

The scene that inspired this was Anakin‚Äôs massacre of the Tusken camp, an unspeakable act that sent ripples through the force across the whole galaxy. An act of cold hearted revenge and anger. Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker‚Äôs son, and he is very similar to his father. Both headstrong, both love to fly, both care very deeply about their friends and loved ones. While Anakin showed some tendencies that could lead to the dark side throughout the movie such as pride and arrogance, it was revenge that truly sent him over the edge and down the dark path, which as Yoda told us would forever dominate his destiny. 

Now, how did this lead me to Luke in the sequels? Because think about what happened to Luke. Jedi Temple destroyed, all his students that didn‚Äôt turn to the dark side killed as far as we know. The reason we‚Äôre given for him exiling himself after is that Luke blamed himself because he drove Ben to the dark side. However, as canon has continued to expand we see that Luke truly did become a Jedi Master in every sense of the term. We also see that Luke knew about Snoke and the Knights of Ren, supposedly defeating Snoke at one point. It is heavily implied that Snoke/Palpatine feared Luke, and needed him out of the way before he was willing to act openly. It wouldn‚Äôt have taken long for Luke to realize Snoke had been manipulating Ben and turning him against him.

So here is my thought. Canon suggests that Luke could have defeated Ben and Snoke, maybe not at the same time but they were rarely together. He could have defeated Snoke and dealt a major blow to the growing First Order, then been a major force in stopping their growth. So how could this great Jedi Master go into exile and leave the galaxy at the mercy of the Sith in a way that satisfies all Star Wars fans? 

It links back to Anakin and the Tuskens. Luke cared for his friends/padawans so much he is prone to revenge. No matter how much he meditated, no matter how much he tried to let it go in his heart when he went after Snoke and the Knights of Ren he knew he would be acting out of revenge. 

He could forgive Ben, his nephew and former apprentice. But he foresaw the only outcome of his final confrontation with him and Snoke/Palpatine being him giving into his anger. Giving into the dark side, like his father and his nephew. Becoming the Vader Palpatine dreamed of when he started turning Anakin, a Sith truly worthy of surpassing Sidious.

And so, feeling it better than the alternative Luke goes into exile. Not because he‚Äôs moping, not because he can‚Äôt face his mistake. Because he truly believes by leaving he is protecting the galaxy.

TLDR: Luke should have gone into exile because he foresaw himself unable to let go of his anger and striking Snoke down out of revenge, giving into the dark side like his father and nephew. He would believe he was protecting his friends and the galaxy from himself, and was justified in his decision. As someone who‚Äôs fictional hero was Luke growing up, this would have made the exile work for me.",StarWars,A Simple Change to Luke‚Äôs Motivation For Exile That Would Have Satisfied (Almost) All Fans - Inspired by A Post Kenobi Prequel Rewatch
1656082985,"I think the Obi-Wan Kenobi finale was a mixed bag, but the series overall had a lot to like. And with the way that it ended, it seems like the door was deliberately kept open for future Obi-Wan adventures down the line. That being said, a lot of the obvious Kenobi story beats were hit in the first season with the Vader/Kenobi rematch, a Qui-gon cameo, and a plot about Leia/Bail Organa. The other issue is that Tatooine in general has been done TO DEATH. A lot of Tatooine stuff you'd think could end up in a Kenobi show was burned through in The Mandalorian and in Boba Fett (Tusken Raisers, Krayt Dragon, wandering samurai hero). 

A potential season 2 would be really different from the first, but could still be interesting. Story-wise it's also a lot more open. So my question is: what kind of story would you like to see? 

A few possible stories off the top of my head:

* A *Yojimbo* inspired story, where Obi-Wan plays two rival gangs on Tatooine against one another in order to protect a village. The gangs could also pose some kind of threat to Luke. Kenobi could even go under cover as a mercenary to infiltrate the gangs, kind of like he did as Rako Hardeen on the Clone Wars. 
* A story with Obi-Wan's brother. That was a little thread introduced in season 1. I definitely think we could end up meeting the brother, seeing them team-up on some kind of adventure, and maybe learn a bit about Obi-Wan's family and home planet. The set-up for this story would be tricky, but there's some potential for sure. 
* A story involving a tribe of Tusken Raiders that have seemingly become more aggressive and much more powerful. Obi-Wan investigates and learns that they are being corrupted and empowered by the dark side of the Force, and that there's a Fallen Jedi on Tatooine. This could be some version of A'Sharad Hett from the old EU. We could see a *Seven Samurai* style defense of a village against a huge raid from the Tuskens, and a clash between Obi-Wan and the Dark Jedi controlling them. 

So what are some of your ideas?",StarWars,"Pitch a story for Kenobi, Season 2"

1656075131,"First of all, feel free to define ""Golden Age"" any way you want - what I'm mainly interested in is why people feel that way about their chosen era.

For me, the Golden Age of Star Wars was the 90s. The decade started off with the release of Timothy Zahn's ""Heir to the Empire"", which I bought as soon as I saw it in a store, quickly devoured, and was left hungry for more. I didn't have to wait long, because shortly after that the two remaining parts of the trilogy were released, and then the floodgates opened as far as books were concerned. I read almost every Star Wars book that was published for the remainder of the decade - some of them were great, some just good, and some... well, I still read them anyway because I was just enjoying the opportunity for more Star Wars content. üôÇ

In the middle of the decade, the THX remastered versions of the movies came out, and Star Wars had never looked better on a TV screen; I'm pretty sure I watched the entire trilogy nearly once a week for a long time. Once I got access to the internet I was able to find some really cool Star Wars sites, and that was where I first saw pictures and descriptions of some of the deleted scenes from the movies, as well as lists of bloopers in the movies, which I printed out and kept with me while I watched them, seeing how many of them I could spot.

1997 saw the release of the Special Editions, and Star Wars was headed back to the big screen. I lived in a small town at the time that only had a small movie theatre with a single screen, so *A New Hope* was the only one I actually got to see in a theatre at the time, but the experience was magical. I got the VHS box set once it was released, and at that point I had two versions of the movies to enjoy, which was awesome.

And of course, you can't talk about Star Wars in the 90s without mentioning *The Phantom Menace*.  The buzz for this movie was like nothing else I have ever experienced - I first heard about the prequels around 1993, so while all of the content I mentioned above was being released, in the background there was a huge amount of anticipation for the first new Star Wars movie in over a decade. I still remember how exciting it was seeing the first concept art online, and all the speculation about what might happen in the movies. That was also the first time I ever watched a movie trailer online - the video was about the size of a credit card so it was hard to pick out all the details, but seeing young Anakin, young Obi-Wan, Padme, and Darth Maul for the first time was undeniably awesome. Oh, and the movie itself? It's not my favourite Star Wars movie, but I still love it and would gladly watch it any day over most other movies I've ever seen. The lightsaber duel is also still my favourite - seeing a couple of Jedi and a Sith, all in their prime, was a game changer and raised the bar for all lightsaber duels going forward.

1656073482,"Hello community. I‚Äôve been noticing a lot of people asking for a Vader series recently, which is making me very thankful r/StarWars redditors are not in charge of writing new canon stories. 

The TWO main reasons why a Vader series would suck ‚Ä¶

1. If they made a Vader series, that would mean making Vader the protagonist‚Ä¶ and how do you make one of the most notorious movie villains of all time a protagonist, without making some kind of watered down, ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù version of Vader? Be honest is that what you want to see? No one would enjoy that because that‚Äôs not Vader. We saw what happened when they gave Boba Fett (a bad guy) his own series. Since he was the protagonist, he became soft and boring and morally right, which let‚Äôs be honest, was not as fun. In a series about vader we would not be getting any scenes of him dragging people through the streets, or killing children, or lighting people on fire , because unfortunately that‚Äôs not the way Hollywood works, we have to be able to root for the protagonist.

2. Vader is better in small doses. He commands more fear and attention when he is on screen in smaller doses, and that‚Äôs the reason you love him whether you know it or not. A whole series about Vader would be hard to pull off because he would lose his fear factor and mystery very quickly if we spend every minute with him on screen. It would destroy the essence of his character. 


The only way to do Vader properly is to leave him as the bad guy, which is we literally just got a whole series about with Kenobi.

1656061950,"Listen, I was one of the biggest advocates for Kenobi series. Ewan McGregor, back as Obi Wan, in a period where he is transitioning Ben Kenobi? Faced against Darth Vader in his prime? Hell, sign me up!  


But like many people, I was concerned about one very dangerous thing that all prequels face before success - stakes. 

I was really worried that the series will focus on the ultimate fate of Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia and Anakin. Meaning, the show will play on the viewer the 'will he survive this episode' card, or 'what kind of trouble could our main hero be in?' card. Things that Star Wars fans, hell, even those who just know general things about Stat Wars, wouldn't care about.

We know everyone makes it to ANH. We know how and where everyone ends up. What was the point of Reva chasing Luke in the final episode? What was the point of Reva facing against Owen? What was the point of the whole plotline with Leia? Hell, I would be okay if those were characters we knew little about, and this was a chance to find out more about them - but we know Leia arugably MORE than anyone! While I did enjoy what I saw of her, with all due respect - this is an Obi-Wan show...None of those side plotlines were significant enough to divert our attention from Obi-Wan so much. 

The only characters I actually cared about (except Obi-Wan) was Tala. But again, that whole plotline was literally from Rogue One's script. 

What I am trying to say is that either this series should have introduced brand new characters for Obi-Wan to go on a journey along, or just be a 1.30 hours movie about Obi-Wan overcoming his guilt about Anakin. But I really felt nothing whenever Leia, Luke or even Obi-Wan were in 'grave danger'.",StarWars,Why I think Kenobi didn't work for many people (including me)

1656058536,"I can't help feeling that there are very few works in the franchise that make him really intimidating and I really want him to be because it makes for better drama and it makes it REALLY mean something if another character escapes from him or defeats him.

Empire established his power the most out of the original trilogy; there's a little jankiness to the fight scenes there that makes them a little less intimidating but that's understandable for a movie that old. 

But in later media where he's established to be so monstrously powerful that the Emperor can only control him now that he's lost 4 limbs and spends his life in physical and psychological agony, he should be an absolute force of nature.

It's a bit like Worf from Star Trek: TNG. We take it for granted that he's very strong so he gets defeated by people to illustrate THEIR strength. But the more you do that the more the character feels like a punching bag. 

It seems to be only stuff outside the main series that hits the note I'm looking for. The ending scene of Rogue One was awesome and his appearance in Jedi: Fallen order was appropriately scary to me.

1656044596," I don't think Anakin ever redeemed himself in Return of the Jedi. 

What did he do, exactly? **He killed someone who he believed was threatening his family. That's the exact same thing he did with Mace in Episode III.** Anakin/Vader as a character would do **anything** for his family, with all the implications that that entails. 

That's why I find him so interesting as a character. His allegiances change completely, his appearance changes drastically, but he has always had the same motivations, the same inner drive. In some ways, he never changes. 

He never truly chains himself to any concept of morality, whether that means threatening Admiral Trench in the Clone Wars, slaughtering children to save his wife, choking out his admirals as Lord Vader, or overthrowing his master to save his child. Jedi and Sith Codes, the general policy of military superiors to their underlings, Imperial or Republic law; it doesn't matter. All that matters is family, regardless of what he has to do to achieve that aim.

**If ROTJ Anakin, lying on the floor dying, was given the choice to either kill a roomful of younglings again or lose Luke, I don't think he would have hesitated to re-enact Order 66.** Vader never redeemed himself, but he did the right thing for the wrong reasons, and that ended up killing him and turning him into an undeserved martyr figure.",StarWars,Hot Take - Vader never turned back to the light side

Or is Rey the balence?",StarWars,"okay maybe Im not tracking. The prophecy, is it Anikin or Rey?"
1656042725,"I'll just start by saying that Obi-Wan had been my favorite SW character since the prequels. I grew up with just enough time to watch the OT religiously and play a bunch of N64 games to fully know all the characters but still be a child when the prequels came out in theaters. 

That all being said getting to see Obi-Wan y developed into the character that he had, the pinnacle of what it means to be a Jedi has been a blast. Literally, no other character, except maybe yoda, has demonstrated the values of being a Jedi more than Obi, and I would say that only because we have seen him go through so much and still stay true to it where yoda has always been a bit removed from hardship. He never knew this family, somewhere resentfully, saw his father figure die Infront of him, his brother/son betrayed him and destroyed everything he never loved and after all that he still can't bring himself to kill him. He maybe made a mistake there, showing mercy to a killer who went on to keep killing, but he also showed unconditional love and empathy. 

In modern films and movies we see a lot of ""good"" characters get taken down a peg and see a bit of their dark side but I have to say it's refreshing to see one who is just unshakable. One who will never succumb, never stop being who he is. 

Obi is also not a child of destiny or some great character meant to bring an end to evil, but his character shows us that talent and destiny doesn't necessarily create the strongest warrior, or the wisest sage. Quiet, hard work and dedication result in the undefeatable. Obi-Wan has defeated Anakin/Vader in every encounter(when at his prime), who many believe to be the most powerful force user even above old palps. Even when Vader finally does defeat obi, it's only because Obi surrenders and allows it. 

So cheers to the dude who can't be broken, to the most powerful and truest Jedi we have yet to see.",StarWars,Tribute to Obi-Wan Kenobi
1656041568,Everything from the choreography to the actual effects used in the Disney era fights are sub standard to me. I would say that Kylo‚Äôs light saber is definitely the most original and visually interesting one to look at but pretty much everything else just leaves me underwhelmed. I just saw a clip of Anakin vs Dooku in episode II and I was like dang that just looks good. The choreography was just so much more intense.,StarWars,No lightsaber fight post Disney is as satisfying as even the worst one in the prequels.
1656040818,"Their fight was incredibly satisfying in the way it tightened up some aspects of ANH - it gives precedence to how Kenobi and Vader feel about each other, gives greater depth and sense to lines like ""Only a master of evil, Darth"" and ""when I left you I was but a learner"". But from a purely non-nitpicky fan standpoint, something I was blown away by was just how bad it made me feel for Vader. Kenobi wailing on his chest plate, Vader's wheezing, his cry in pain when slashed across the back - I honestly welled up. I wanted Kenobi to leave him alone in that moment. 

This show has spent so much time exploring just how brutal and despicable Vader is that you normally wouldn't feel any sympathy for him if it were any other villain, but in an instant he's transformed from a faceless, murderous monster to a vulnerable, crippled and pitiful husk. Combined with the flashback from ep. 5, I feel it gives an excellent depth to Vader's insecurity of never being able to best his master, despite being arguably more powerful/talented. Their exchange at the end, with Kenobi tearfully apologizing and Vader's reply being a glimmer of Anakin before being swallowed back by the dark side was heartbreaking, and gives greater precedence and meaning to their confrontation on the Death Star.

I know there's been mixed reaction to the series but this was a huge highpoint for me and made the entire thing worth it. This confrontation between them was necessary and could have been bungled in so many different ways - but I felt it was excellently done. I'm truly satisfied having it be part of the larger story and canon.

Curious as to what other people think of the minutiae of this scene.",StarWars,Something I really appreciated about the confrontation between Vader and Kenobi.
1656040508,"Why why why would they have Kenobi acknowledge verbally that Anakin is no more, and that only an evil Darth remains, and then walk away without finishing him?? Thats the show telling us that it‚Äôs okay for Kenobi to kill Vader and prevent so much suffering to come. Why would they write him to make the exact same fucking mistake as Episode 3? 

An easy fix, have Obi Wan sense during the fight that Luke was in mortal danger. That gives Obi Wan a valid reason to leave Darth Vader and head back to Tattooine. 

So many plot points are driven by rationale that I can‚Äôt turn my brain off to enjoy. And my biggest gripe is that there really was no story worth telling. Reva‚Äôs plan for revenge made no sense, and her turn to the light was obvious and done so poorly.",StarWars,I‚Äôm so frustrated by the writing in Kenobi.

I feel a second season would just mess it up and add an unneeded story. Plus, it couldn't have the emotional weight of this season without REALLY screwing some stuff up and making more plotholes.

1656039939,"It is fair to say that JJ probably pitched a meeting before the tirlogy began regarding the overall trilogy arc. Something to the effect of ""Rey is a mystery girl who struggles to be accepted, and the Skywalker family decide in the end that she is alright and that she can be a sspiritual Skywalker despite initial concerns of her Palpatine DNA. Light redeems dark, love conquers all, etc"". Meeting was something like that I'll bet, and if you pitched it that way to a random sample of star wars fans, it would probably get a good response. Someone could make a real good story with that idea, and very similar stories have done so like avatar: the last airbender to thunderous applause. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I love it to death now, I don't think the trilogy is in any position to be spoken of in the same breath as other highly intricately layered stories like Dune, better call saul/breaking bad or attack on titan where the plot happens in a manner that the audience thinks they understand it, until the plot twists in just the right way to simultaneously prove us wrong and wonder why we never saw the twit coming from a mile away. Nah, the ST is a bit too loose to be elevated so high. But I am at a point that I believe much of its problems can be repaired with other stories to fill it in although I have no idea what that might look like. With caveats though, such as emperor Palpatine himself in the flesh is one thing I probably will never accept because why doesn't anybody ever die in star wars?! I'm including Dave Filoni in this complaint too, probably more than JJ and Rian because this has been a thing ever since Maul. Before Maul people only came back as spirits. Dave is one of the main people doing these things, and I bet JJ thought it was weird that its okay when Dave does it.

1656030690,"The last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi connected with me on an extraordinary level that I did not expect.

To give some context, I have been, what I believed to be, happily married to the mother of my son for six years. A few months ago, less than a week before our sixth wedding anniversary, my wife explained to me that she had feelings for another man and was planning on leaving me. I have felt a myriad of painful emotions and have tasted some despair. The woman whom I have loved for the past decade of my life has become someone else. She is self-isolated and refuses to open up to her best friends or family. My best friend, my closest confidant, is gone. I feel like I let my two-year-old son down. I feel like I let my wife down. I feel like less of man. I feel like a failure.

Fast forward a few weeks, and Obi-Wan Kenobi releases its first episode. I immediately identify with Obi-Wan. We see him as a sad, crippled man clearly struggling with emotional, if not psychological, damage from his past. He is clearly broken, and it seems that he has absolutely no hope. He cries out to his Master, and he does not hear from him. I am deeply religious, so I completely understand the feeling of calling out to someone only to hear the deafening silence.

I understand that the show is not perfect and has its flaws, but Ewan‚Äôs acting throughout the series has resonated with me on a personal level. In the final episode, we see Obi-Wan struggle with hopelessness and despair, buried deep beneath the rubble with which his best friend, his closest companion, has used to bury him alive. In that moment, Obi-Wan sees flashes of hope, and this hope gives him the strength to rise above the pain and suffering he has experienced. He finds renewed strength to face his former brother. Finally, Obi-Wan faces Anakin and apologizes one more time for everything. A broken and beat Vader then expresses that Anakin Skywalker is dead, and the man, now more of a machine than anything else, is someone completely different. In a way, we see Obi-Wan is now able to finally move on from the grief, despair, and guilt he felt. Recognizing that he could not have done any more for Anakin, he is able to move on into acceptance. 

The last moments of this scene helped me see things somewhat differently in my situation. Could I have done things differently? I believe so. Ultimately, however, people make their own decisions, and sometimes the people we once knew can be gone forever, even if their physical being is standing right before you.

The season ends with what I appropriately believe should be called a new hope for Obi-Wan. Though Padm√©‚Äô and Anakin‚Äôs story ended in tragedy, like my marriage, there is a restored hope in their children. Likewise, though my son will have to experience the difficulties in growing up in a broken home, I have a new hope that he will rise to the occasion, and something beautiful can still be born out of all the pain, suffering, and mourning that I am currently experiencing.

It may sound cheesy, but this final episode has really helped me cope somewhat with my situation, and I hope it has helped other fans across the globe. God Bless.",StarWars,"Obi-Wan Kenobi and Processing Grief, Despair, and Guilt"

1656028833,"After the finale of OBK, we‚Äôre all reassessing how it re-contextualizes the OT. Going in, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that just as the paragraph from ANH‚Äôs opening scroll served as the basis for Rogue One, Vader‚Äôs line, ‚ÄúI sense something, a presence I‚Äôve not felt since‚Ä¶‚Äù was the basis for the rematch we just saw. 

I don‚Äôt think Vader was referring to Obi-Wan anymore. The presence he felt was Anakin. 

At the end of the duel, Vader makes it clear, Anakin is gone. He killed him. Obi-wan affirms this, story wise, saying ‚ÄúThen my friend is truly dead.‚Äù

The next we see, the Emperor senses that Vader may be wavering. Notice how Darth Vader sits up straight almost immediately. Straight to ‚ÄúKenobi means nothing.‚Äù Let‚Äôs face it, as much master/apprentice Sidious and Vader‚Äôs relationship is, it‚Äôs also a bully/victim relationship. Vader knows Sidious can Replace him if he wanted to, so his reaction is really him committing himself to the dark side. In some ways, it‚Äôs the closure of the character arcs of Obi wan and Anakin from
The prequel trilogy. Obi-Wan now learning to trust the force like Qui-Gon wanted, Anakin now fully transformed into Darth Vader.

Which brings me to A New Hope. With Luke, leia AND Obi-wan present in the Death Star, it is easy to see that it would stir the force. That Vader would sense all of them. But it would also stir that remnant of Anakin. Ten years later, the Jedi he (Vader) brushed aside for his new master was back. For ten years, Anakin was a ghost in the body of Vader. Vader would‚Äôve suppressed any sense of Anakin left in him. Which is why that sudden stirring in him was a surprise. If this duel in OBK completed the character arc of Anakin to Darth Vader, I would say that this moment was the start of the second arc of Darth Vader to Anakin. 

Also, ‚Äúwhen I left you I was but a learner but now I am the master‚Äù clearly we see now that that was Vader. Full stop. He‚Äôs been the master in control since this duel. I used to think oh how will they work around that but I think it was done very well; by suppressing Anakin, Vader has exerted totally control.

Vader is very powerful but we got to see his human side the side that just wanted to be loved . Obi wan apologising to him broke me. It made all of us cry.

To me, these seem like the last words Anakin, not Vader, says to Obi-Wan. That's how I felt it when watching it for the first time, and after re-watching it several times it seems coherent to me.

In the scene, the transition from blue light to red, he's eyes, and his facial expression just before it turns fully maniac suggests to me that those words are from the bit of Anakin that's still in there and that can still come out, and tries to ""free"" Obi-Wan of his burden.

I don't know, that's probably not the intention of the line. Either way I loved the whole duel, it was pretty emotional, and thinking about that line this way made it even more emotional for me.

There‚Äôs just one plot hole/theory I have that I do want answered. It‚Äôs not big but it involves the contrast in Obi-Wan‚Äôs appearances.

As we know, the series is set about a decade after Revenge of the Sith and about 9 years before A New Hope. Keeping that in mind, a plot hole for me is Obi-Wan‚Äôs appearance. As we all clearly saw there is quite a difference between how old Ewan McGregor looked in the series and how old Alec Guinness looked in A New Hope. My friend and I discussed this and we each came up with a theory.

His theory is that Obi-Wan, at some point, had to use the Force to an extensive degree which caused him age rapidly, similar to Palpatine during his fight against Mace Windu.

My theory, while simpler, is probably less likely: he simply aged terribly due to the stress and devastation of everything that followed Order 66. I actually based this theory on a real life example involving another legendary Star Wars actor: Peter Cushing aka Tarkin. 

Cushing played Abraham Van Helsing in the movie ‚ÄúDracula A.D. 1972‚Äù. A couple years before filming started, Cushing‚Äôs wife passed away and it really took a toll on him. He aged so terribly that they switched his role in the movie from being the father of Stephanie Beacham‚Äôs character to her grandfather.

If you haven‚Äôt seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Also another Star Wars Easter Egg in the film: Count Dracula is played by Christopher Lee aka Count Dooku. There are probably a lot of fans who already know this, but I thought I‚Äôd bring it up.

Anyway those are the theories. Do I think an S2 is needed it? Probably not, but if done right, I‚Äôd like to see it and see if it answers my question. What do y‚Äôall think?",StarWars,Obi-Wan‚Äôs Appearance?

How after what should have been triumph in Return of the Jedi, Leia spends the rest of her life losing everything that has ever mattered to her until she eventually dies alone, having never known peace. It‚Äôs so hard for me to invest in these characters knowing that the sequels just inflict trauma after trauma on them. The only happy endings in the sequel trilogies are for the new characters.

1656025229,"Okay, I want to discuss this now that the show is over. We just saw an insanely huge feat of strength from Obi-Wan in that final fight with Vader. I fully expect him to jump up a few spaces and I wanted to hear what the community has to say about it.  


Don't get me wrong, I don't think anyone considered Obi-wan to be weak, per se, however I do think people largely considered him to be weaker than the likes of Rey, Luke, and Yoda. Now, however, I do think there is a point to be made for him to be one of the strongest characters in the current Canon.  


Here are some feats I think are worth considering when discussing.  


* Obi-wan bested Darth Maul on multiple occasions, the first Sith in generations to come out of hiding after defeating Qui-gon, said to be one of the wisest and most force attuned jedi out of anyone in the order at the time. One of my favorite underrated encounters between the two of them was when Maul teamed up with Savage Oppress and still couldn't manage to defeat Kenobi.
* Kenobi bested General Grievous on multiple occasions and was trusted to end the Clone Wars by leading the charge. In episode 3 it was established that the last leader of the Separatists was General Grievous and defeating him would mean an effective end to the Clone Wars. Grievous killed so many Jedi throughout his tenure. Personally, I probably would have sent more than just Kenobi, just in case, but evidently, that would not have been necessary.
* Given these being his two most encountered foes, it would make total sense for him to master form III, Soresu, and eventually become The Master of Soresu. Obi-wan is exceptionally good with a lightsaber in hand and I believe he as been in the most on-screen lightsaber duels. At least, if we're only looking at live action content, that is. Grievous and Maul are two of the most aggressive fighters we see in Canon, so developing a defensive style to outlast them makes a lot of sense and works out very good in power rankings.
* He also wound up to be an exceptional Bounty Hunter counter. In the movies we see him force Jango's retreat as well as Cad Bane's in the Clone Wars. I understand these characters aren't force sensitive, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. Jango Fett specifically was identified by Palpatine to be the perfect genetic sample to create an army of warriors. Fett was also culturally raised by Mandalorians, known for their tools and specialized equipment to best force users. 
* He resisted the Dark Side and becomes a Force Ghost. Not many people have the ability to become Force Ghosts and despite all the pain Obi-wan had to experience, he never let his emotions control him.
* Now, we can say he has beaten Vader twice in his life and even ""lost"" on his own terms. Not many people are able to defeat him, and perhaps part of his success involves some part of Anakin holding back, but I don't think he is holding back all the much in the grand scheme of things. Vader tried to bury Obi-wan alive in the finale, which doesn't strike me as a move by someone who is holding back by much, if at all.   


Ultimately, I would argue that after the last episode he could be considered more powerful than the likes of Yoda, Qui-gon, and Ahsoka. I would even go as far to say rivals or surpassing in power to the likes of Luke and Rey.

5th episode was delightful, the finale was decent but mostly everything prior to that was underwhelming or lacklustre. 

The narrative wasn‚Äôt great. 
The majority of the show was just:
Save child from room while Reva throws a temper tantrum. 

I wish they had a larger assortment of competent writers because the standards between episodes was distinctly inconsistent. 

I also wish they featured more of Hayden, especially because of how much they used him for promoting the show and yet he had very scarce appearances throughout.

As a show it doesn‚Äôt contribute much to the canon but regardless it still is worth the watch.

If no one knowing that was so important for Luke‚Äôs safety why would Owen screw up like that other that terrible writing.",StarWars,Why would Owen let people on Tatooine know he is Luke‚Äôs uncle not father
1656022900,"I wanna start this off by saying I don‚Äôt want this to sound like a baseless rant, there are SO many amazing scenes in this show and I absolutely love some of the new ideas it brings to the table. For the most part, Obi-Wan has delivered on more than I ever expected.

But man, it is really hard to focus on some of these amazing scenes when the camera is shaking like there‚Äôs a constant earthquake. Shaky-cam is a good technique to show disorientation or can give a ‚Äúfirst-person‚Äù perspective like you‚Äôre running alongside the action. It‚Äôs fantastic when used sparingly. 

But then there are scenes where characters are just‚Ä¶talking? Like when Obi Wan is talking to the other Jedi in the desert, the camera just won‚Äôt stand still. There are action scenes where you can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs going on not because the action is fast paced or disorienting, but because that stupid camera won‚Äôt focus. Order 66 begins with this really nice stable pan-in shot, but in that same shot the camera then decides to have a fit the second Clones enter the scene in the background. It‚Äôs almost nauseating.

Part of what made Star Wars‚Äô action and character moments so engaging and classic is that the camera was always focused on what was happening. There was never a moment in a space battle, lightsaber fight, shootout, or a dialogue session that needed to constantly shake the camera to get the point across. The newer movies use this technique sure, but it‚Äôs again *used sparingly*. It works because the scenes in question call for it. But last night in one of the most important character moments of not only the series, but the entire **franchise**, where Obi Wan speaks to an unmasked Vader for the first time with a ton of emotion, buildup, and character development backing it up‚Ä¶

The camera *will not. Stop. Shaking.*

I want to focus on what is pretty much the entire reason this show exists, the character interaction between Obi-Wan and Vader, and it feels like the show is trying to actively distract me from it. I can‚Äôt focus on the emotions the show wants me to feel because even when characters are standing perfectly still, the camera is still being shot like we‚Äôre in a warzone. Was it that much of a distraction to anyone else? Everyone I‚Äôve talked to in person seems to agree, but I‚Äôd like some more opinions because I really feel like an asshole for thinking that.

I think Episode VI was a perfect end to this story. I personally don‚Äôt think an S2 is needed, however, if there is one, it needs to not have Leia in it. I think his interactions with her are done. Luke, yea, since they live on the same planet but Luke shouldn‚Äôt be a focus. I would want it to focus on Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Vader can be in it, too, but with the way this season ended, Them running into each other again and again would be the same -possibly- I‚Äôm not versed in the EU or comics. 

I feel that Reva doesn‚Äôt need her own show, so her story could/should end with S2 with her death or something. I do like how her arc ended this season and wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing where she goes from there. 

More Owen and Beru would be great. Badass Uncle and Aunt action was fun and fantastic. Could always use more.

1656018296,"When I first heard this show was actually in production and going to be on its way soon, I'll be honest: I didn't have high hopes. I didn't think it would flop, mind you. I just thought it was unnecessary for the most part. Yes, we all love Obi-Wan and Ewan McGregor. But to bring him back just for one show completely about his own character, I just didn't think it was needed and thought Disney was just doing it for the money (and for the fanservice, for us at least). 

And the first episode didn't really change my view that much. I didn't think it was bad. I actually thought it was pretty good and that Ewan really did a great job. The cinematography was also really good (Disney is definitely getting their money's worth with the Mos Eisley set). And I resolved myself to see this series through and just see where they were going with it. And I'm kind of glad I did. It was nice seeing a broken man like Obi finally find a reason to keep going and put his past behind him for good. 

The one major complaint I have about the series though is Reva. So she was a Jedi youngling that survived being gutted by Darth Vader. And she became Grand Inquisitor to get close enough to him to try and kill him, but she failed. So instead of just packing up and going home, she decides to try and kill Luke. For...what reason again? ""Justice""? By killing Luke, a defenseless child, she is exacting justice...how exactly? I don't know. Maybe her plot flew over my head, but she just seemed like an unnecessary villain in this story. It's hard enough dealing with one vengeful Sith let alone two. 

Overall, I'm glad I stuck with the show. I still think Mandalorian is better in terms of the screenwriting and overall plot, but this one is an honorable second. I look forward to seeing where the writers decide to go with Obi-Wan since we've got a lot of years between now and New Hope, canonically speaking.",StarWars,[Spoilers] My thoughts on the Obi-Wan Kenobi finale and the show as a whole
1656018201,"Hello there! I just finished the last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it was amazing. I'm trying to keep this post spoilers free.

So, I think that the series is generally good. The first three episodes felt slow, but the other half went really well in my opinion. I think that it's not bad as a six part series, but in my opinion the series would have worked better as a movie.

There was way too much filler in a couple of episodes to fully keep my focus and interest in it. I love when something happened, but during the first half there just didn't. I was way too judgemental on several things, such as Reva's character. She got an amazing character development, even though I think it was a bit too late. I kinda hope we would see her again in some form.

I think that there was an attempt to make it like Clone Wars, especially on Reva's character, but it kinda failed at that. In my opinion that is mostly because the show was only six episodes long, so we didn't really get a grip on this new character. I do enjoy though that the episodes kinda mirrored the events of episodes I-VI. As mr. Lucas would say, it ""rhymed"".

Kenobi series would've been better as a movie, but it was an overall enjoyable experience. The last two episodes are very rewatchable, but the start was way too slow. Solid 8/10, even though it was carried by the second half. Good job Evan, Hayden, and all the others that were a part of this series.",StarWars,Obi-Wan Kenobi final thoughts

But after she has let Luke live she doesn't have that, she has let her rage and need for revenge go. But someone she is still keeping herself alive? 

Second of all. Having her die her because of not being able to keep herself alive anymore means that she made the concous choice of not killing this kid, of not going down the dark path knowing full well that it was the only way she could continue to fuel her anger and dark side and continue living.

- Reva‚Äôs arc was incredibly predictable and disconnected by the episodic format
- GI is underused and could‚Äôve easily been the main villain instead of Reva
- The show essentially copied rebels Vader/ Ahsoka fight with the fight with Vader in OWK
- Some stupid decisions like following Kenobis tiny drop ship with the entire star destroyer instead of launching fighters‚Ä¶
- Copying fallen order with the entire Fortress Inquisitiorious
- Leia being a plot device when the story could‚Äôve easily focused exclusively on Kenobi/Qui-gon/Vader
- some of the CGI could‚Äôve been better

1656014106,"Now, before I get into what the title of this post says, I just want to say that I enjoy the prequels. Sure, the dialogue and acting may be a little clunky at times, and the overabundance of CGI can be distracting. But overall, I thought that the prequels did a good job at fleshing out the Star Wars universe with the introduction of new worlds like Coruscant, Mustafar, and Kamino. I have also come to appreciate Hayden Christensen‚Äôs portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, and I especially love how he portrayed Darth Vader throughout the first season of Kenobi! 

Anyway, one issue that I have with the prequels is the inclusion of the Chosen One prophecy, and what it means for the story of Star Wars. My problem with it‚Äôs inclusion is that it kind of makes the Star Wars universe feel smaller than it should be. Since it states that Anakin Skywalker is supposed to bring balance to the Force, I feel that it puts him and his bloodline on a pedestal (which I understand was George Lucas‚Äôs intention with the Skywalker saga), and makes the story feel less inclusive for other characters.

One of the things I love about Rogue One, Solo, The Mandalorian, and the upcoming Disney Plus shows is that they give other characters time to breathe and make the Star Wars universe feel bigger and richer.

Now, this isn‚Äôt to say that I‚Äôm against telling the story of Anakin Skywalker. I just feel that Lucas could‚Äôve done it in a way that doesn‚Äôt overstate his/Vader‚Äôs importance in the grand scheme of things.",StarWars,An issue that I have with the Chosen One prophecy.

1656013891,"So, a lot of people are divided on Kenobi‚Äôs anime friendship power-up against Vader. After seeing Kenobi almost unable to use his powers, we‚Äôre now seeing him stronger than ever before because of a few flashbacks; and a lot of people don‚Äôt like it and feel like it is an unearned boost that messes with the power scaling. 

Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that you‚Äôre wrong. Not wrong in how you feel about it, that‚Äôs your opinion, but you‚Äôre wrong about it being unearned, and is actually a major plot point in the entirety of the Star Wars universe. 

Jedi are taught to suppress their emotions, and Kenobi took this very seriously. Even though his Master Qui Gonn pushed him to express himself and be mindful, Kenobi stuck by the Jedi‚Äôs teachings to the letter. The battle against Maul on Naboo saw Kenobi lose Qui-Gonn, before he himself defeated him. Afterwards, Kenobi dedicated his lightsaber training to defensive combat in response to Qui-Gonn‚Äôs defeat, which further emphasised the need for a calm mind which suppressed his emotions. 

We saw how cautious this made Kenobi when fighting Count Dooku, and how it made him a very unemotional teacher to Anakin, who was being taught to ignore his emotions and even the dreams of his mother‚Äôs death, which could have been prevented if Obi had more aware of Anakin‚Äôs feelings, but he was always scared that Anakin‚Äôs emotions and recklessness would get him killed. 

After Order 66, Kenobi stopped practicing the Jedi code, and lost touch with the force. In this time, he mourned his padawan, as well as all the Jedi that had died, and for the first time in his life he was left alone with his emotions and he truly suppressed them, ran away haunted by the past, and he lost touch with the force.

When Leia fell from the rooftop, it was his emotions that used the force to save her, and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs realising as he‚Äôs buried under the rocks. He let go of suppressing his emotions and let them fuel him, which is why his lightsaber style immediately changes to aggressive and confident. Kenobi has been stifling himself for his whole life since Qui-Gonn‚Äôs death, but he realised he was right, and the Jedi were wrong. 

So, whilst it may seem like bullshit, Kenobi had just finished a character development arc that started in The Phantom Menace",StarWars,Let‚Äôs talk about a contentious Kenobi issue‚Ä¶ (spoilers for Episode 6)

Or is he retreating further into the desert to be close by but no longer ""in charge"" of Luke's protection?

and I noticed something. As soon as the ship appears to be caught in a tractor beam, Obi-Wan engages a look of intense concentration. I'm not trying to say that there was no tractor beam, but based on what we know from the recent series, would it be fair to say that Obi-Wan used the force to prevent the ship from breaking free from the pull of the tractor beam?   


My line of thinking is essentially based on OWK Episode 6, where Obi-Wan channels some sort-of 'dark side' energy through his attachment to Leia, allowing him to beat Vader. Could it be he had a similar feeling when observing the Death Star, sensing that both Leia and Vader were on board, and also knowing that Leia had requested his help specifically, and now was the perfect time for him to transcend his life energy into the force. But also appreciating the idea that for everyone else on board, the idea of just boarding the Death Star was certain death, so rather than suggest it, Obi-Wan used the will of the force to make it happen?

I just thought it was really cool, noticing the change of expression on Alec Guiness' face to an intense concentration as soon as Han tries to break the ship free from the tractor beam.

But something that I‚Äôve seen in peoples reactions and discussions about the episode had me think about a deeper significance of this duel that some people on the internet have probably talked about but I wanted to make my own post to talk about it because it seems really cool to me!

Even with all the power Vader has, and the fact that Obi-Wan regained his powers not that recently after being a full on hermit what seemed like only a week or so before his duel I think it‚Äôs interesting to think of the psychological aspect of the duel. Anakin of course lost to Obi-Wan on Mustafar and has been thinking of his loss for years, planning his next fight with his master. And I think the show did a great job of showing the human nerves inside of anakin. He uses one hand for the first moments of the duel in episode 6 but quickly switches to 2, hands and to me, despite being in a suit, almost looks nervous or not as foreboding as Vader typically does. He seems more focused (which ofc he is he has been waiting for this moment) but idk something about it seems like nerves to me. He is certainly powerful in this fight and even beats obi initially, but when he was losing towards the end, all I could see was a desperate anakin trying to not lose again, making those larger swings one does in desperation. And I think that shows even more sides to the young man in Vader‚Äôs suit.

To Vader, Obi is that one person that he just can‚Äôt beat no matter how good he gets. And the fact obiwan was his master and older than him no doubt adds to it. It‚Äôs all mental. Like in sports teams there are matchups where no matter how good one team is, there is a history between the two that just seems to make everyone know the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù team will lose anyway. Possibly because of the nerves from previous losses.  I think the show, even if unintended and I‚Äôm just being over-analytical did a great job with the duel!

And I know people had their gripes with it in the middle.. but this show made me feel like a kid again. I got lost in the magic, so thank you Obi Wan Kenobi.

It was a tragic story of life after war, rediscovering who they were before after a tragic loss of a war and a best friend/brother. I went in with with-held expectations. Genuinely didn't expect to see Vader as much as we saw Vader. I didn't expect to see Obi-Wan and Vader go face to face so early, I wasn't expecting the very good young leia. I loved Revas background (a young jedi infiltrating the ranks of the empire just to avenge her friends, she felt as if she NEEDED to give justice) which was a very nice touch and gave a lot of depth to that. 

I LOVED Vader here. Honestly, At the end of the day? I'm glad the Imperial March didn't play until the last 10 minutes. It shows Vader was allowed off his leash for a while; until he lost against Kenobi again which left palpatine keeping him close and stopping him going wild because he can't afford to lose him.

I LOVED the parallels to stuff, and yes. I agree, it wasn't a perfect show. But what is ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, for me, a fan of this series for 20+ years, felt absolutely satisfied with it and I will always remember watching Obi Wan Kenobi. The show wasn't perfect for everyone, but for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 

There was obviously gripes I had with it, nothing is 'perfect', majorly coming from music, the trailer had great music! And the show didn't include it, which isn't bad, I loved the music for the show but I feel like I was edged with that trailer and we lacked it in the show! I assume there was a reason though?

But this show let me rediscover what I love most about Star Wars.. I got lost in the magic of the galaxy far far away. I felt like a kid watching star wars again, I got lost in the magic. My imagination ran wild. Kenobi let me rediscover what I love about star wars and it's the fact you don't need to go through everything with a fine tooth comb, some thing can be dumb, something can be silly and you just let your imagination run wild as to WHY this happened and how they got away with it. I just loved Kenobi top to bottom. It's okay if you didn't, but I couldn't had been more happier with it... Plus, it had episode 2 obi wan and my favourite star wars character making an appearance at the end sooooooooo, it gets bonus points! 

Also, lighting? I saw people complain that it looked like a fanfilm and the lighting was shitty. Vader and Kenobi in episode 3 is visually, some of my favourite stuff from star wars in general, maybe I'm just blind to stuff looking bad,  but I was SOLD on that.

-Vader‚Äôs foe coming back with a surprise attack
-Vader‚Äôs foe slicing a chunk of his mask off, revealing Anakin‚Äôs face and a cool hybrid Vader/Anakin voice
-A subsequent conversation between the two where Vader‚Äôs foe tries to appeal to Anakin and apologizes for past mistakes (Ahsoka telling him she won‚Äôt leave him like she did before and Kenobi apologizing for failing him)

How on earth is she alive? She has the biggest plot armour in the whole show, yet she should be the most expendable since no lore evolves around her.

But she not only picks the worst opportunity to attempt to do so, but she then snuffs this motivation for trying to kill Luke? WHY?!

3. Personality - it's so hard to find any sense sorrow for her character because she's just a very angry child that is either screaming or whining.

4. Character design - there's nothing unique in her design as she feels like a rip off from lots of characters.

5. Sins - how she is forgiven for killing jedi and hanging them in the streets, trying to torture Leia and kidnap her, snuffed out the rebels trade route, slicing innocent people's limbs, ordering the attack on the outpost, and whatever she did to get in the position is mindblowing.

However, Disney redeemed itself with Obi Wan. Holy moly, this is exactly what we wanted, well at least me. I wanted to see the aftermath of ROTS and order 66 how Darth Vader would interact with Obi Wan. 

This show started slow, but wow it was a fantastic progression. The absolute brutality of Vader and the way he hates and blames Obi Wan. Anakin's character build up from episodes 1-3 it all just culminated here. 

Obi Wan Part 6 shows exactly how Anakin ended up. He was fully consumed by the dark side and it couldn't have been executed any better by the directors and writers, everything was just so fanastic. You could see and hear his pain, agony, and emotional suffering in that final duel with Obi Wan.

Disney, WE NEED MORE OF THIS! Make a season 2!

And people seemed pretty receptive to it, and I've recently developed more of the idea. I'm a roleplayer with a pretty shallow knowledge (and interest, honestly) of the setting but would like to know how the community feels about the character presented. If you want some idea for the context you can look at my profile if you want, but it's not really important.  


A former slave is nearly killed by a highly isolationist (they kill all witnesses) and reclusive sect of Mandalorians who're contracted to kill her master when, after being offered a merciful death by the clan leader for putting up a difficult chase, she bites down on his hand manages to bite his thumb off.  


Ordering his comrades to put their weapons away and laughing while his stub continues to bleed, he offers instead to allow her to join them so that she can learn how to defend herself, how to live free without being exploited or used by others. She agrees, naturally, and in a bizarre moment of joviality he gives her a piggyback ride back to their home deep within the slums and alleys of Nar-Shaddaa, collecting his finger as a momento of this wily slave they stumbled on that clearly has much to offer them.  


Growing up with them she turns out to be a tolerable enough fighter, but their clan is more interested in softer skills anyways which she's talented at; blackmailing people, lying, detecting lies, knowing how to see the worst things in people and how to take advantage of their vices and weaknesses, fabricating evidence, tampering with police evidence, splicing camera footage; they give her the nickname 'Hindsight' because of her role in obfuscating their presence, making it so that they can go unseen.  


The story / RP properly opens with the discovery of their clan leader's corpse, a man that she'd developed a mutually fond and loving paternal relationship with despite him trying to kill her, sending her into a web of mystery and discovery as she's tasked with finding who did it. She's the one that does all the work in hiding the trail they leave behind after all, so she's the best person they can ask for to track them down.   


Our lead Mando personality-wise is kind of a slick, smooth talking Jimmy McGill. Their clan doesn't pride itself on brash action and usually doesn't even wear their armor when out and about, so she's become very good at talking her way in and out of things, all flashing smiles and nudges between scenes of gunslinging action and violence with slavers and gangsters and Hutts as she frees slaves and chases whatever loose ends she can get her hands on.  


That's it. Mostly just looking to see if people think 'Wow, that's pretty cool' or 'Wow, that's pretty uninteresting.'

- All the destruction Vader has caused the galaxy.

1656001738,"I don't really post much, I usually just read what everyone has to say. It's great to see that people in general really like the Kenobi series and are satisfied with the finale. What's more interesting is that different people had different takeaways and impacts from the many bits and pieces you see that link things up to the prequels and sequels. 

I must add, that it's incredibly difficult to write a story which has a binding past and future, but oddly enough it's the 2 stories that have this constraint (Kenobi and Rogue One) that have actually done well in the post Disney takeover and not created significant plot holes, where others have been just satisfactory or a downright failure (except Mandalorian perhaps). 

These constraints do have a darker side though, I do understand why those involved may have wanted to keep it short and a limited series. Sure there are some scenes which make you go ""Ohh why not do this and why do that and convolute the plot and what not"", but it's not a big deal.

It also does really well to add deeper meaning to several dialogues and scenes in the original trilogy which may have previously made you go ""Eh?"" or feel a bit off.

My two ideas:

1. Have a season two but from the perspective of Vader. Same timelines, same emotion, different perspective. 

2. A lot of people, myself included, would have liked to see more prequel era content. Flashbacks are sometimes controversial due to their lack of investment.

1655998110,"Spoilers for Kenobi


It‚Äôs not a setup to a terrible joke, but a pretty neat parallel I noticed in Episode VI of Kenobi. 

Reva is very much like Anakin in AOTC - impulsive, angry, conflicted. She also is dealing with a lot of unprocessed trauma from Order 66, like Anakin was dealing with his and his mother‚Äôs history as slaves. 

This naturally leads to anger in both of them. While Anakin hides it from the Jedi, Reva has nowhere to go and winds up with the Inquisitors, who stoke that anger for their own ends. 

For both, they hit a breaking point. For Anakin that is his mother‚Äôs death at the hand of the Tuskens and for Reva it is getting ‚Äúkilled‚Äù once again by Vader.

They both respond by going out into the desert with murderous intentions (Anakin was already there, but it was on his mind before Shmi died). Anakin kills them all, children included. Reva is focused on one person in particular, Skywalker‚Äôs son, for her revenge. But she doesn‚Äôt go full Anakin, she can‚Äôt take revenge. 

And here‚Äôs the visual parallel ‚Äî Anakin and Reva walking out of the desert to the Lars homestead with a body in their arms. Anakin carries his dead mother, and death is the choice he has made, turning for that first real moment to the Dark Side. But Reva, who has turned to the Light, carries a living Skywalker, and returns him to Owen and Beru. I wonder if they remembered seeing Anakin walking that same way, carrying Shmi.

1655997768,"Let me explain.

Anime, while having compelling stories and (sometimes) groundbreaking animation, has one glaring flaw in its stfucture. And that is the filler episodes.

If you watch the medium, you already understand where I might be going with this.

If not, let me explain.

In anime they have the main storyline with the main cast of characters going against progressively tougher villains until the story concludes naturally or the creators run out of ideas and/or source material. However, during some of the more griping story arcs, they will pad for time(and episode numbers) by adding non-sequitor adventures that deal with secondary or tertiary characters doing things that may or may not link in some way to the main story line.

An example, off the top of my head, would be during Dragonball Z when we had ? number of episodes dealing with the Saiyaman arc which was, ultimately, just an excuse to get Gohan and Videl together, nothing else really.

And thats what the first 5 episodes of Kenobi were. Filler.

To the best of my knowledge we didnt really get anything the pushed the character forward outside of a side quest adventure helping Leia get out of a jam due to his chosen duty to look over Luke. Again, as far as I know, Obi Wan really doesnt have much character growth through the first 5 episodes of the show, but during the 6th episode(when we pick back up with the main story started in the first 3 movies) we have the culmination of the Obi-Wan arc going from somewhat resentful older brother taking on an unwanted but important duty to finally coming to peace with the death of, as well as his part in the downfall of, his closest friend and brother.

I had high hopes for Obi-Wan because Ewen MacGregors portrayal in the prequels made Kenobi one of my top 5 Jedi, but now that its done I feel the entire thing could be ignored outside of the finale.

But thats just my 2 cents and I'd like to know if anyone else feels the same way or might be able to give me their certain point of view on the series in case my knowledge didnt pick up on something, or I just straight up missed an important detail or the like.




My knowledge of cinema comes from almost 4 decades(at this point) of ingesting pop culture in almost all its forms and picking things up as I went along. I may not have the eloquence or training others have in spades but I know a thing or two, itll just come across as ignorant due to the aforementioned setbacks sometimes

Each of the first episodes can be dedicated to a style, and throughout the season we can see it out to the test against enemies.

It is about Star Wars, if you couldn't guess, and I just have some questions that I need help answering (since I am unsure if I'm right or note, and it's better to be safe then sorry no?)

1:Does the force have some limits? Let me elaborate;

(if you're interested, read this): This 'man' I'm making is using the force for his own benefit, credits and what not, but due to some 'accident' his body was left mutilated and beyond recovery. His brain and several important organs were salvageable and were used to make his body back (unlike grievouses, they used most of his credits to make it perfect per se)

Whilst he was normal him and his brother used what knowledge they had to learn the basics (of the force and lightsaber combat), and out of rage he requested there to be added six arms so that he would be unstoppable in his quest for greed.

(question): So, I know it might suck but it is still in experimental phase of writing, could he still use the force due to his body (except mind and several organs) begin just a machine?

2:Could a person use six sabers at once?

3:Which form focuses most in taking down the enemy fast with quick movement?

4:Is greed, in star wars, a good reason to be evil/feared?

5:How do I complete such a task? Meaning;

How do I make him evil/feared?

6:When is the perfect time to add him, I am all lost over the time to add him. (I am fully aware that I'm asking much, lmao like, am I writing this book am I right? But I am fully confused as to where to put him, before the clone wars/after, before or after the sequels/prequels?)

Given that Anakin was a trained as a jedi, he has no other point of reference for training levels. Most sith would think they are far beyond, better than any jedi no matter what stage they are in their training/experience. So when they meet in A New Hope, Vader says when we last met I was but the learner but now I am the master. Obi-Wan responds with only a master of evil Darth.

1655991514,"Hi guys, completely out of the blue a question came to me...but didn't Obi-Wan ever wonder what happened to Ahsoka? In Episode 3 when he and Yoda are on Polis Massa Kenobi don't mention Ahsoka at all. Of course OBVIOUSLY she had not yet been created at that time but if we look at the big picture of things now, where almost everything is now explained, that thing makes no sense. Ahsoka was Anakin's Padawan but she also spent a ton of time with Kenobi, plus in the season finale of The Clone Wars before Order 66 if I'm not mistaken she also meets Kenobi again, so the least he could do is at least wonder what happened to her. Of course maybe he gave her up for dead because of Order 66 but the point is that in no work, that I know of, does he even give a thought to her in the post-Empire era.

So I'm wondering by any chance has this been delved into anywhere else? Maybe in the novel From a Certain Point of View or something (similar to the part where Kenobi in Episode 4 goes to R2 secretly to tell him that he missed her).

Is there any work where you see him even the slightest bit concerned about Ahsoka? But even just as a matter of ""father-grandson"" concern.

Also, we through Rebels know that Ahsoka (if I'm not mistaken!!!) knows that Kenobi is alive on Tatooine and talks to Ezra about it...but Kenobi on the other hand knows that she is alive? Ezra tells him and tells Kenobi?

In short please clarify my thoughts a bit, thank you all and sorry for the bad English.

PS. But does Rex know that Ahsoka is alive? When Ezra leaves her to fight Darth Vader still didn't know about the world of worlds and Rex almost cries for her, can we assume that Rex then found out that she was actually saved?

1655989909,"Its not at all that I DISLIKED the show... I did not.  I can say with the upmost sincerity that I think it was a fine show.


BUT, what really ""happened"" in the show that was of real consequence or changed our views of any characters?


What new plotlines or backstories were introduced that significantly are making us change how we view any of these characters?


What new and exciting characters were we introduced to, that make you look forward to learning more and more about them?


I dont view Kenobi any differently than I did prior to this series.  Thats not a bad thing, but I didn't learn anything striking or groundbreaking other than an offhand comment that he might have a brother out there.


My views on Vader are largely also unchanged... he's a man fueled by rage and a thirst for power and revenge... to the point it clouds his better judgement repeatedly... this is what led to Anakin's downfall in the first place.  No real change, no great new revelations other than I suppose his proclamation that HE killed Anakin.. 


Leia was a precocious kid who early in the series was borderline annoying, but they toned that back a bit.  We dont really learn too much more about her or see her go on any real character arc of anything substantial.


Luke, well... we dont really get much of anything there.  So thats largely unchanged.


I guess Lars and Beru are really the characters who I'd say we learned the most about and perhaps changed our perception of.  Edgerton did a good job as Lars.  These characters did show growth of sorts.


The Inquisitors... Reva was interesting, but is now gone basically... the Grand Inquisitor and the Brothers/Sisters... we learned more or less nothing new about them.  


My ""complaint"" is that this series seemed more like filler and a large excuse to have Vader and Kenobi have another lightsaber battle.   


I just overall was disappointed because whereas when I watched the Mandalorian, or Boba Fett, or many of the Marvel series... I'm left afterward with that feeling of ""I have to have more... they can't leave me without giving me more""

Whereas this series was fine, but doesn't really move the needle.  I'm largely in the same place I was before this series.


To me, its like someone said ""here are all these amazing ingredients, how about you make a meal""... and so you start imagining the chef is going to make some amazing dish that will knock your socks off.... but then you get served a hamburger and fries.   They taste great... you love hamburgers and fries.  But really you wonder ""why didn't you make something more exciting or substantial... you had all those amazing ingredients to use""


I hear there will be a season 2.   I hope they do something MORE with it... because this left me scratching my head saying... ""thats it?""",StarWars,"Unpopular Opinion I'm sure... The Obi-Wan series was disappointing because it didn't really ""do"" or achieve much..."

However by the end of it I felt thouroughly flabbetgasted. To me the way it ended, it makes no sense. The fact that Obi Wan could basically kill Vader at any point in their life between Mustafar and A New Hope just screams of lazy writing. 

This has a lot of consequences on the whole world they‚Äôre building. How are you supposed to believe that Vader is this powerful, almost invincible force if he struggles so much with a fairly average Jedi. This also completely takes away from Luke‚Äôs achievements. Fact of the matter is, in this version that Disney is building with the shows and movies, Luke is completely unnecessary.

Not only does he not serve the role of bringing Anakin back to the light and fulfilling the prophecy(As we learn that Palpatine isn‚Äôt even dead), but he also doesn‚Äôt even fulfill the role of being the only powerful enough force user to tale down his father. Obi Wan could‚Äôve done that at any point apparently.

The last dialogue was amazing, but it would have been so much more powerful in a stalemate type of scenario, or even more so in a Vader advantage.

Imagine that ultimately overwhelmes Obi Wan, but as the Jedi sees his friend‚Äôs disfigured face he drops tears and says he is sorry. Then the same dialogue goes ahead, leaving Vader severely distraught(as seen with the clever blue-red saber light play, symbolizing Anakin tapping into his good side), so Obi Wan manages to say goodbye and escape. This lefts us with the much better ending of Vader being a redutable villain that is ultimately incapable of fulfilling his master‚Äôs plans due to his own internal struggles between good and evil",StarWars,Unpopular opinion: Obi Wan really shouldn‚Äôt have been able to beat Vader and it oozes of lazy writing

1655984888,"To start with let me just say i thought the Obi-Wan show was fine, but ultimately a missed opportunity in my opinion. There were great moments in the series, as well as poor and unnecessary parts. And there were some parts which i liked on paper but I don't think they were executed correctly.

I think the 2 main issues the series had were lack of focus and presentation issues. Both of these would have been solved with a film. There were certain plots included Reva and the grand inquisitor, and certain episodes such as the infiltration of the imperial base, that just felt like padding to what should have been the main story of Obi-Wan discovering Vader is alive, and confronting him.

When i first watched the Mandalorian, I was amazed how good it looked for a TV show, and thought if all the other Star Wars shows looked like that then i'd prefer them over films, as they can tell deeper stories with them. However I personally felt Obi-Wan lost that aesthetic and certain scenes especially felt like a normal TV show, and lacked the big budget feel. Maybe there were issues with Covid that i'm not aware of, but I feel a project with a magnitude such as this should've had the presentation to match.

All in all, i think in the end they tried to stretch too much out of this part of Obi-Wan's life where a simple story would've worked much better. But that's just my opinion.",StarWars,Opinion: Obi-Wan Kenobi would've worked better as a film.

Neither of them expected that to happen and perhaps didn‚Äôt even want that to happen, but they took Luke in and raised him as their own.

Then that same old Jedi, Obi Wan, comes out of hiding 10 years later and brings with him an Inquisitor, Reva.  Owen and Baru, because of their love for Luke, of course defended him and defended him bravely.  Owen basically uses a large stick against Reva‚Äôs lightsaber just to at least try to defend his family, even if its futile.  Baru also distracts Reva long enough for Luke to attempt to run away.  All for a child they didn‚Äôt ask for and took in anyway, who they learned to love as their own.

Then 9 years after that, they are doing the best they can to raise Luke away from all the mess that his father and Obi Wan were part of.  And then are murdered by the empire, who weren‚Äôt even looking for Luke, they were looking for the droids.

Nothing in Bail's message explained Luke's connection to Vader and at that point she wasn't really an Inquisitor, which itself was a front.

- This one's more vague and I know it's something the series has struggled with for awhile but, how do people think the Jedi are a myth when Inquisitor squads are running around actively hunting them and grilling the populace to do it?

If the Emperor was not brought back as a ringer at the last minute then to my mind we would have avoided the innate silliness of ""the emperor somehow returned"", Rey would have remained Rey from Nowhere rather than being either a Palpatine/Skywalker and the trilogy would have felt more cohesive with the final film jarring less with the ethos of the second.

How much of an improvement if any do you think moving the story in that direction would have been? And if they had done so, how would it have best played out?

However in my case, this show totally did not hit the landing. I‚Äôll admit it has some of the most incredible, coolest star wars/vader moments in the whole saga, and Hayden and Ewan absolutely KILL it, but the amount of stupid, unnecessary, nonsensical shit that happens is beyond me. This absolutely should have been a 2 and a half hour movie about Obi Wan and Darth Vader, period. 

There‚Äôs so many weird, uncanny, low-budget moments like the Leia chase sequenceS (can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs more than one), stormtrooper slap, bouncing lightsaber, awkward dialogues, bad acting, shaky cam. Also for some reason the VFX looked very cheap to me. 

In my opinion, the series did nothing to justify its existence. Except for that 5 minute dialogue between obi and darth at the end, there‚Äôs NOTHING that I feel I was missing out on or that I needed to know in between ROTS and ANH.

Does anyone else feel this way?

1655969606,"There‚Äôs a lot of people wondering why Obi Wan didn‚Äôt kill Anakin/Vader for a second time in Obi Wan Kenobi Episode 6. And I think I may know why this happened. I want to take us to a moment in the show where Vader buries Obi Wan in rocks. As Obi Wan is struggling to hold the rocks up from crushing him, he begins to hear the voices of Anakin/Darth Vader in his head, reminding him of how he‚Äôs failed Anakin. 

As these emotions begin to rise, notice how he begins to no longer struggle to hold up the rubble. When he‚Äôs channeling these emotions, he‚Äôs using dark side energy. He flings the rocks away like they‚Äôre nothing, and notice how his fighting style changes drastically. Obi Wan is a master in the defensive style of saber dueling. But when he fights Vader after coming out of the rubble, Obi Wan becomes extremely aggressive. He uses the force to pick up tons of boulders and hurls them at Vader. He‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs engaging Vader and Vader is forced to go on the defensive. Obi Wan even elects to saber bash Vaders life support systems on his chest. 

When Vaders helmet is broken and Obi Wan gets to see Anakins scarred face, Obi Wan sees Anakin‚Äôs real face, and not the facade that the mask represent. If he was to kill his apprentice, he would give into his emotions, something that only a Sith would do. Obi Wan‚Äôs refusal to kill his apprentice is him ‚Äúdoing what he must‚Äù and nothing more.

Don't get me wrong, Ewon is really fucking good as Kenobi, but if anything, he's like the second best thing. I'm more of a casual Star Wars fan, but I do agree that Vader is one of the greatest villains in cinema ever.

He has done plenty of awful things but ya just can't help but love the shit out of him.

1655968311,I remember growing up and my dad having all three of the OT on VHS. I never wanted to watch them because I thought they looked dumb and I didn‚Äôt really like the characters. Then I saw the Prequel Trilogy as a kid and really enjoyed them but everyone I seemed to talk to hated them and said they were bad. As a kid and to this day I love the dynamic of Anakin and Obi-Wan so much that everytime I rewatch the PT I get sad because I know that Anakin is gonna become Vader. As an adult I still don‚Äôt love the OT and I still don‚Äôt like the characters that much. Han is super pompous and annoying and Luke is a complainer in the first movie and in the third movie after leaving Yoda introduces himself as a Jedi Knight. ( Um no sir you are a padawan at best.) It could just be where those movies came out first and are so old it just isn‚Äôt for me BUT my point is I just sat this past week and watched Episodes 1-6 and I did enjoy the OT a lot more this time around.

1655968081,"So, throughout the past 5 weeks that kenobi was being put out, I've seen a lot of comments of being insisting that certain themes and pieces should be used in kenobi (i.e. ""I'm disappointed they aren't using duel of the fates"", etc) and getting upset that there wasn't more  of John Williams music being used. while Williams music is amazing and iconic, I actually like the fact that it was used more sparingly in kenobi. The few times it was used was mainly for specific characters(i.e. the imperial March when showing Vader) cause those themes r pretty much almost like a vital part of the characters on screen presence (which definitely just goes to show just how great Williams music was in the movies). Doing so allows for Williams music to still be a big part of star wars while also giving more opportunities for newer composers to create within the star wars universe. The lack of Williams music in kenobi didn't bother me at all, and even tho the music in kenobi isn't exactly as memorable or iconic as the music from the main saga is, it still fit really well and was great imo. Idk. I'm not opposed to increasing Williams presence in star wars media, but I like the idea of new people getting the opportunity to try and create their own reputation within the musical aspect of star wars. Plus, I feel like the less frequent use of Williams music makes it all the more special or cool when it is used

Did I miss some behind-the-scenes lore confirmations or something?

I *always* figured Anakin was mad at Padme when he saw Obi-Wan because he thought she'd already sided with the Jedi and had brought Obi-Wan to arrest him. This is kind of evidenced by the fact that he *turns his back* to Obi-Wan shortly after the Force choke and monologues rather than... you know, charging right into his face.

The *only* line I can interpret to even remotely suggest Anakin had an idea about them in his head is, ""You will not take her from me!"" But... I dunno. Kinda always thought he was just saying, ""I won't let you turn her against me in this!""

1655957260,"SPOILERS FOR KENOBI FINALE

The fact that Leia and Obi Wan/Ben have a history was resolved in the finale, but I think that scene had a lot more meaning that ""keep this a secret for me."" 

First, keep in mind that Reva kidnapped Leia because Reva believed that Obi Wan's history with Bail would make him want to come save Leia. As soon as Leia was rescued (the first time), she seemed to know that there was something more to it. She even questioned if Obi Wan was her father, because it was clear to her that he was there for *her,* not for Bail. She asks if he knew her parents, and he lies. They grow closer, Obi Wan continues to show her that he deeply cares for her and even does truly love her. All the while, Obi Wan is clearly there for her sake, out of a commitment to her, not just her adopted father.

The last time they see each other, Obi Wan finally admits to Leia that he knew her mother and her father. He not only tells her he knew them, but he describes her for them and the ways she is like them. In that moment, Leia knew that Obi Wan's love for her is born out of his past with her bio parents, not her adopted parents. He says he wants to tell her more, but she says, ""you don't have to."" She knows. ""No one must know, or it could endanger us both."" What can they not know? **No one must know the connection between Leia and Obi Wan is deeper than the fact that he fought alongside Bail in the Clone Wars.** No one must know that Obi Wan is looking out for Leia. No one must know that his love for her has to do with her birth parents - if they knew that it is not a leap to discover who her birth parents are. Surely, if Vader realized that Leia is the same age his child would be and his former brother/father/master was willing to go to any length to protect her... 

That is why in a New Hope, Leia tells Obi Wan "" Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire."" Obviously, it is not Bail who is begging Obi Wan, it is Leia. **But the Empire still believes, and needs to continue to believe, that Obi Wan is loyal to Bail, not Leia. Leia knows the reason for this is because there is something about her parents that would be dangerous for her and her loved ones if the Empire knew. Otherwise, Obi Wan wouldn't have kept it from her.** In her message, she is being cryptic so that if the droids fell into the wrong hands, the Empire doesn't find out about their connection to each other. She calls him General Kenobi, which reminds him of his leadership in the clone wars, but also in the events of her childhood, where the rebels called him General in front of her, but to anyone else it sounds distant. 

In Tatooine with Luke, Obi Wan doesn't mention his history with Leia, because he does not want Luke to know about her just yet. Luke is now aware that Obi Wan was in Tatooine for him, and that Obi Wan knew his father and fought beside him in the clone wars. If Obi Wan was open with Luke about Leia, he might begin to connect dots - oh there's one other child who you are devoted to protecting at all costs, who also is an orphan? 

Leia is not shy about knowing Obi Wan (Ben) when Luke finally saves her in a New Hope. She only trusts him when he says he is there with Obi Wan and she immediately gets up to go find him. When she sees him die, she understands that he just sacrificed himself for her, and she will not waste that by  allowing her emotions to overcome her. She needs to get to safety. 

Even when Obi Wan is gone, the threat over her of her parentage is not. She does not tell anyone, including Luke, about her relationship to Obi Wan because that knowledge still carries with it the same consequences, which she ""knows"" even if just based on how much Obi Wan is willing to do to protect her. 

**When Luke finally reveals to Leia in ROTJ that she is his sister, her reply is ""I Know... somehow I've always known.""** The same way she **knew** when Obi Wan couldn't tell her more about her parents. She's known all along that it was something, and now the pieces are finally put together and the true reality for her is finally realized.

1655951390,"I would like to let people know that this will contain major spoilers. Yes, I am fully aware of the series is decades old, but I always like to leave a warning as a courtesy.  With that out of the way, let's continue with the main topic.

As we all know, when Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi first meet, they are discussing topics regarding the Jedi and the Dark times that fell upon the Republic.  When Luke asked how his father died, Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioned that a former pupil of his named Darth Vader betrayed and murdered his father.

The question I have to ask is did George Lucas intend for Darth Vader to not have any family relation with Luke?  When we were first told of the event with Luke's father, it was a rather direct explanation of one person murdering another.  Later on, we found out that Obi-Wan was telling his story from a certain point of view.  Darth Vader was not a person.  He was the physical manifestation of the evil that took over and extinguished the light side that was Anakin Skywalker.

Was this always going to be the storyline since the initial production around the late '70s?  If so, I'm wondering if there are any interviews that can confirm it.  Otherwise, I think Lucas personally had thought of the idea of Darth Vader not having any relation with a main character, but Irvin Kershner felt it was a bigger impact to change that idea for the sequel.",StarWars,"I have a some good questions about Darth Vader in ""A New Hope"""

1655948269,"First of all I enjoyed the Obi-Wan Kenobi show I thought it had some really entertaining moments throughout however, I noticed again a particular flaw with Star Wars in general which is that there is a lack of consistency in the outcomes of duels that is usually chalked up to poor writing when the plot demands something happen. This post I'm going to share some examples of this and how these could have been avoided. These are Episode 1-9 encounters only.

**Rey vs Kylo Ren E7**

Their fights in the sequels are ordered by Rey winning first, tie and then Kylo Ren winning. This doesn't make much sense given Rey is the untrained prodigy whereas Kylo Ren is already trained by Luke Skywalker and destroys the new jedi order. This could have been changed by simply having Kylo Ren win, it makes more sense for the plot anyway as then he could bring her in and try to turn her as they do it the next episode anyway, or she could barely escape.

**Mace Windu vs Palpatine**

There has been a lot of lore as to why Mace Windu won the fight but the intention behind it was that Mace just won. This could easily have made more sense if Anakin rushes in to see Palpatine overwhelming Mace only for Anakin to help Mace and subdue Palpatine but to want to arrest him but Mace is intent that he is too dangerous to be left alive and then Anakin thinks the knowledge to save Padme and bring peace will be lost so he turns.

**Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader E6**

This was already an iconic duel but it would have made more sense had Vader won and Palpatine true to the sith says Luke is too weak and tries to kill him prompting Vader to then fight Palpatine possibly Luke joins and Vader sacrificially kills Palpatine and fulfils the prophecy of the chosen one. It would be poetic that Vader turns on the sith for the same reason he turned on the jedi, for love.

These are 3 instances of the less powerful character winning a crucial duel purely because the plot demanded where there should have been more circumstances that would have made it make sense for the same intended outcome. There are multiple other instances of this happening which I list below.

1655943630,"Heard that phrase a lot on Vader since childhood. 

But as I was getting older and familiar with cinematography and literature classics, I saw Vader as a pop culture thing within. His motivations in the original trilogy were comprehensible but felt fairy and not moving enough. He was more a toy than a character.  

Then the prequels opened that vast layers of lore on Vaders backstory as Anakin. 

But still, the feeling remained that they are, in fact, two separete characters. 

And as this is true in some way, you couldn't necessary picture how one became another.  

Yeah, we saw evil Haden and the whole suit-up thing. But the transformation was more cosmetical and felt more like a switch-over, as there wasn't enough exploration in between.  

And then came the Kenobi series. After the second episode, I commented somewhere here that it would be cool to see Haden play the transition part from Anakin to Darth, his agony, psychological stress, etc. And they almost gave it here. Just one scene, but boy, it was a home run. Finally, someone went through to show us the transition from Haden to James Earl. The half helmet, the voice switching, and the light play - were effective and spot on. And the lines where Dart admits he himself killed his previous persona with a slight vicious grin - are just classic good-ass filmmaking. So earlier, I struggled to fantasize about how Anakin was adjusting to becoming Vader. And now, that scene filled the gaps where the imagination failed. Now having all the pieces from prequels to Kenobi, I'm having fun with elaborating thoughts on the greatest villain in history, arguably.  

The guy was the most skilled worrier of all galaxy, but still felt insecure, was arrogant and violent, lost his mother, the love of his life and children, felt betrayed and had been punked embarrassingly by his teacher three times now, was dismembered and burned, encaged with prosthetics and eternal darkness on his face, felt enormous pain since and grew mad willpower to overcome it physically, but probably melted down mentally. Everyday face to face with the anguish and thoughts of what he lost for decades. That man was ultimate pain utilizing machine. And all of that I could play in my imagination before, but now the illustration by Haden in that little scene with that little smirk made it reacher and vivid. Now he feels complete. Feel like it would be one of the most iconic SW scenes somewhere near the Mustafar fight.  

And Reva here was sloppy written but essential as an antipode, the example of a victim of violence, who was able to return from the bottom of her dark side due to different reasons, you to decide which.  

Not a fan of writing on the whole, have problems with a lot of weird and dummy choices by the writers and Deborah Chow. But have to admit, they sure did work carefully with the main characters, giving them respect and enrichment. After the finale, you can truly see that. It can be examined immediately, as the first feeling after the end was to turn on A New Hope. The clever work with the pieces of dialogues added weight and depth to the first film. 

Finally, everything felt tied, heavy and dramatic in a classic good way.  

Those last episodes, two fights and some casting choices made light saber duels cool again, Star Wars great again, tying with the legacy neatly. 

So if a claim on the greatest villain is debatable, I feel sure Dart Vader is up to the list now.  

May the force be with him.

1655937789,"I was very bored and I have an unhealthy amount of knowledge about the seven lightsaber combat forms, so I decided to put that to use and figure out which form I think Cal Kestis from Jedi: Fallen Order (and soon Jedi: Survivor) uses. I analyzed every single attack Cal can do ‚Äì \[this youtube video\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z3cKv5-1FE) shows them all ‚Äì and decided which form I think they each use. Then I came to a conclusion at the bottom of this post.  
Basic Attack/Combo (single blade): This seems to just be basic attacks. If I had to assign it to a form I‚Äôd go with Shii-Cho (Form 1). Shii-Cho focuses on basic blocks and parries, as well as four broad target zones: left side, right side, head, and legs. The basic attack appears to simply be targeting the left and right side of the target‚Äôs body. Cal also follows through with his strikes and they appear fluid and strong while also being basic, which is another characteristic of Shii-Cho. Pretty much every lightsaber duelist knows and to some extent uses these basic Shii-Cho attacks though.  
Basic Attack/Combo (double blade): Even though it looks simple just like the single blade one, I don‚Äôt think this is Shii-Cho for two reasons. First, its move are faster and don‚Äôt follow through like the single bladed moves do, and second I don‚Äôt think that a simplistic form like Shii-Cho would work well with a double-bladed lightsaber. Instead, I think that these attacks more closely resemble Niman (Form 6). Despite using a double-bladed lightsaber, no showy tricks are used and he mostly sticks to basic attacks. Also, Niman is most closely associated with Jar‚ÄôKai (dual wielding two lightsabers at once) and I think that might translate over to using a double-bladed one.  
Delay Thrust (single blade): This one I think is definitely Makashi (Form 2). Makashi heavily emphasizes moving forward and backward along a straight line, and jabs like that aimed to pierce an opponent with the blade‚Äôs point (a mark of contact known as ‚Äúshiak‚Äù) have been stated by Dooku (the best known Makashi duelist in canon) to be the ‚Äúsugnature move of a Makashi master).  
Delay Combo (double blade): I was kind of surprised when I watched this focusing on what form it would be, because honestly it looks like the same attack Maul uses in his duel against Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, which I thought would be Juyo (Form 7, a form that is forbidden for Jedi below the rank of Master). But then I realized that Maul also uses Niman, so I would assume it‚Äôs Niman that Cal is using here.  
Overhead Slash (single blade): This one‚Äôs fairly straightforward. It‚Äôs a move from Djem So (the melee variant of Form 5) called Falling Avalanche.  
Leaping Slash (single blade): I‚Äôd say that this is a combination of a little bit of Djem So and mostly Ataru (Form 4). It obviously has elements of the Falling Avalanche from Djem So, but he also spins around and jumps, kind of attacking from the air, which I think seems like Ataru. I think Cal blended the Falling Avalanche from Djem So and the move ‚Äújung su ma‚Äù from Ataru. Jung su ma is a rapid spin which is one of the three ‚Äúsu ma‚Äù moves, the foundation of Form 4.  
Whiwlwind Slash (double blade): I think that this is a combination of Shii-Cho and Niman. Niman for the same reason as the double-bladed basic attack/combo, and Shii-Cho because the fluid spin and follow through definitely makes me think of Shii-Cho. Although I think there could probably be an argument made for this being Ataru.  
Whiwlwind Throw (double blade): Same as the whirlwind slash, it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing just with a lightsaber throw added.  
Evasive Kick: This is really just a kick, so there‚Äôs not much to be said about it. If I had to assign a form to it though I think I‚Äôd have to say Djem So or Ataru. Djem So‚Äôs signature move is the fluid riposte, which redirect‚Äôs an opponent‚Äôs attack and then instantly counterattacks. But the mobility of this move leads me to think that Ataru is more likely than Djem So, and I don‚Äôt know if it can really be considered a fluid riposte if Cal‚Äôs blade never actually blocks the enemy‚Äôs blade. Also Ahsoka, a prominent Ataru user, frequently incorporated kicks into his fighting, so I think Ataru is my final verdict.  
Running Slash (single blade): The mobility of this attack and the fact that Cal jumps in the air and spins to do it means that I think it‚Äôs got to be Ataru, although just like the Leaping Slash it might have elements of Djem So.  
Running Slash (double blade): Ataru, same reason as the single blade Running Slash.  
Dash Strike (single blade): I‚Äôm gonna say Ataru for this one too.  
Dash Strike (double blade): Also Ataru.  
Jumping Slash (single blade): Also Ataru, he‚Äôs literally jumping into the air. Kind of seems like a Hawk-Bat Swoop to me  
Falling Slash (single blade): Ataru, this is fairly obvious.  
Parry &amp; Counter (single blade): This one could either be Ataru (some of the animations, particularly the one where he rolls over the enemy‚Äôs back, show Cal outmaneuvering the enemy to get a hit in) or Djem So (just the concept of this move sounds like Djem So‚Äôs fluid riposte), and because of the amount of different animations that can be used for it I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs sometimes one and sometimes the other.  
Switch Attack (single blade): Pretty safe to say that this is Niman. Since he‚Äôs using two lightsabers it‚Äôs pretty much Jar‚ÄôKai. Although since he never dual wields for extended periods, there is a chance he doesn‚Äôt know Jar‚ÄôKai and is just improvising with this move.  
Switch Attack (double blade): Same as the single bladed version.  
Lightsaber Throw: I don‚Äôt think throwing a lightsaber is really associated with a particular combat form, so I‚Äôm not gonna label this one.  
Lightsaber Deflection: The definition of Shien (the ranged variant of Form 5) is deflecting blaster bolts back at your opponent, so it has to be that. With that said though, it appears that users of pretty much every form have learned to deflect blaster bolts in this way.  
Force Pull: When he pulls an enemy and attacks them with his lightsaber, he‚Äôs using the Draw Closer move, which is one of the signatures of Niman.  
I‚Äôm skipping the rest of the Force powers because they can‚Äôt really be attributed with a form. I will say though that using the Force in conjunction with your lightsaber is usually associated with Niman.  
So my conclusion? I think that which form Cal uses depends on your play style and which attacks you use most often, but I think in general he uses a combination of Form 4 (Ataru) and Form 6 (Niman) which some elements of Form 5 (Shien/Djem So). I personally use what I think would be a more Niman-heavy playstyle, meaning that I rely on using the Force a lot to immobilize the enemies. An Ataru playstyle would have a lot of mobility and a lot of Running Slashes, Dash Strikes, etc.. And a Shien/Djem So playstyle would be using a lot of perfectly timed parries to stagger the enemy, and not moving around as much as the other forms.",StarWars,Cal Kestis Lightsaber Form

1655936337,"In my opinion, Count Dooku was the worst main villain in the entire mainline saga. He didn‚Äôt hold a candle to the intimidation of Darth Vader, he didn‚Äôt have the badassery of Maul, he didn‚Äôt have the fascination of General Grievous, and he didn‚Äôt have the overall villainy of Darth Sidious. He just comes out of no where in Episode 2 and gets killed off in the first 10 minutes of Episode 3. I think he can be simply fixed by introducing him in Episode 1 while keeping everything else the same so that the audience have an attachment to the character and his fall to the dark side.

We would first meet him in the Jedi council room in the Temple on Courascant when Anakin is being introduced to the council. Rather than it being Ki-Adi Mundi who questions Anakin alongside Mace Windu and Yoda, it will be Dooku. 

After the council room scene, we will have a scene in which Qui-Gon seeks counsel in his former master. This will establish their relationship as master and apprentice as well as establishing Dooku‚Äôs wisdom. He will be portrayed as kind and wise but still skeptical of his apprentice‚Äôs belief that Anakin is the chosen one. Ultimately, he will give his support to Qui-Gon.

We will last see Dooku at his padawan‚Äôs funeral. While the rest of the Jedi are accepting of his fate as they see this as what the force willed, Dooku will be angry at what the Jedi order has become due to both the entanglement with politics and the hubris/arrogance at the disbelief that the Sith could possibly have returned without them knowing. The last shot of Dooku will be of him leaving the funeral midway through, followed by a shot of Yoda sensing his own former padawan.

1655934230,"Or cried watching a show/movie.

Long time Star Wars fan and I think of the franchise every day of my life. I know the lore better than most fans.

So anyway - the Kenobi finale: The fight with Vader was cool but disappointing until I realised there was a part two. My face lit up then. To be honest I forget most of the finale because there is one moment dominating the space in my mind right now. It was nice to see Alderaan looking pretty clean too. But after that, when Obi-Wan went to talk to Luke, then got back on his space horse/camel‚Ä¶and rode off into the distance‚Ä¶a blue entity started to manifest itself. I knew as soon as I saw the signature pony tail that my Jedi was back on the screen. I started welling up. A sense of joy unlike any I ever felt before manifested within me. As he turned around and started talking, it was bubbling up and I couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop it before I felt tears roll down my face. Qui-Gon Jinn was back in Star Wars, even if only for a few seconds.

Qui-Gon is my favourite Star Wars character ever and has been since I played the Lego Star Wars games as a kid. I didn‚Äôt know how to save the game so I always ended up playing level 1 all the time, so me and Qui-Gon became good buds :) he‚Äôs obviously the best part about Episode 1 and I was bummed he didn‚Äôt appear as a force ghost in 2 or especially 3, or any Star Wars movie again after. It was great when he appeared in TCW but that‚Äôs not live action‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt Liam‚Äôs figure (Neeson is my favourite actor too). I went to the opening midnight showing of TROS in 2019 and hearing my Jedi‚Äôs voice even for just a few seconds was a highlight of the film for me (it wasn‚Äôt hard to stand out in that film‚Ä¶).

I‚Äôd been hoping and excited for a Kenobi movie/series long before it was even announced as Obi-Wan is one of my favourites as well, and there was so much to explore between 3 &amp; 4. Amazing to see Ewan back in the role by the way. Vader was immense in this show as well too. But back to the show, I could only dream my Jedi would show up in it as Neeson was getting old (still love him and hope he makes LOTS more movies!) and it is Disney Star Wars‚Ä¶plus I saw him say in an interview that TV isn‚Äôt his thing when asked about a Kenobi cameo, and he‚Äôd be open to reprising the role if a movie was to come about, so I was kinda bummed. So you can imagine my surprise seeing my favourite actor and favourite character appear onscreen again when it was so unanticipated. It was just‚Ä¶too much for me I guess.

And yes I know it shouldn‚Äôt have been possible for him to manifest as a full force ghost but I don‚Äôt even care. I am a hardcore Star Wars fan and I don‚Äôt mind that they bent the lord a bit so I could see my favourite Jedi on the screen again. And Liam‚Äôs performance, short and all as it is, is brilliant. The lines of dialogue are just perfect for the scenario and it rounded out a show, where I‚Äôd have loved to see him, in the best way possible.

1655933100,"I know this might be a hot take since I usually see nothing but love and praise for any new Vader content we get, but personally I think Vader has been made to look incompetent and bad at his job overall in his various recent appearances. In this post I'm going to list all the different projects he's appeared in (that I've seen at least) and tell you my issues with how he is portrayed and the actions he takes.

\-------------- Spoilers for Kenobi --------------------

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Force Unleashed:

This isn't canon, but I'm going to count it because it's probably the one that portrays him the best in my opinion. He's scheming (based on his manipulation of Starkiller), the intro gives us a great feeling of his power, they tease his desire to overthrow the Emperor, and he overall seems like the powerful sith lord from the OT. Only at the end when Starkiller is comically overpowered do you even stand a chance against him.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Rebels:

I think Vader is pretty decent in this show. He doesn't stick around too long, and it does seem weird that he up and leaves the hunt for two jedi. He's portrayed to be very strong here also, absolutely dominating Kanan and Ezra and defeating Ahsoka after a fair fight. The portrayal of his Vader/Anakin split is also brilliantly done in my opinion. My main gripe is how all three jedi he fights manage to get away from him in one manner or another, to varying degrees of believability. 

Escaped jedi counter: 3

&amp;#x200B;

3. Rogue One:

Character wise he's done well. He has very little, but very effective screen time. Not the worst appearance, but as much as the hallway scene is cool, it seems ridiculous that he's unable to stop the rebels getting away with the plans. Especially with what we've seen in Kenobi, which is set years earlier, he should be able to tear right through and grab the plans far easier. Ultimately the hallway scene is cool if inappropriate for a character like Vader who should be hyper-competent.

Escaped jedi counter: 3

&amp;#x200B;

4. Jedi: Fallen Order:

This might be blasphemy, but I don't really like the Vader section in this game. Yes, the idea is clever, but the execution is kinda awkward in my opinion. Vader literally has you in his grip 4 feet away and he decides to... throw you for some reason. Then instead of seizing you he wastes his time shredding up the room and throwing shit at you. Then when he finally catches up to you he stands there taunting you and Cere when he should be capturing if not killing you both (and before people claim he likes to draw out his encounters with jedi, remember that he kills Obi-Wan off the bat in ANH). So he has cool factor here, but honestly this makes Vader look very bad at his role as a Jedi hunter.

Escaped jedi counter: 5

&amp;#x200B;

4.5: Clone Wars S7:

He's in one scene.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Kenobi:

This one is obviously the freshest, and is both the coolest and dumbest appearance of this character. I do love his extravagant use of the force, pulling down the ship and causing mini earthquakes. I also like how ruthless he is in this show. But my god, Vader is dumb as rocks here. The worst offender is him letting Obi-Wan escape in episode 3. He somehow can't put out fire he already just put out minutes ago, neither can he use the force to grab Obi or the droid (and that ""he likes the chase"" argument I mentioned earlier, which was used to defend this, doesn't apply based on the rest of the show). Then he lets Reva lead the ground assault on Kenobi for some reason, only showing up at the last minute. His fight with Reva is interesting, but the reveal that he always knew about her motives is stupid. Why keep her around then? Something something her rage is useful? All she did was fuck up the ground assault and let Kenobi go, it was hardly a big brain move to keep her in play as a tool (and no her idea to track Leia wasn't clever either, that was poor writing in the show). Then we have his final duel of the show with Obi, which was epic until he dropped a couple of rocks on Kenobi and called it a day. WHY would he not make sure the kill succeeded? Is he really that careless? Then he loses to Kenobi afterwards (which I don't like but that's an issue with the show overall, not his character), and they basically repeat the Twilight of the Apprentice Ahsoka moment, but with less impact. After the show, despite knowing that Leia was allied with Kenobi, he won't think to track down her or Bail to interrogate them. Why he doesn't do this is unknown, but it's a massive oversight and makes no sense at all.

Escaped jedi counter: 6

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, I think the writers of most of these projects were desperate to use this character but couldn't commit to realistically having such an overpowered character in the story without him winning, so they cop out an escape or win. Notice that I've included an ""escaped jedi"" counter to track the jedi he has fought and failed to kill. To my count it's 6. Now count how many jedi he's killed in these projects (excluding TFU). Has he even killed any? He executes Trilla I guess... not a very skilled jedi hunter is he?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know why you disagree. Hopefully I included enough positives that you know that I'm not a rampant hater of the character, I actually like him a lot. I just feel the character has been coasting off his rep as a ""fearsome Jedi-killing stoic monster"" but in practice the creators just seem to use flashy action scenes to cover up his inability to achieve things as a villain.",StarWars,Unpopular Opinion: Darth Vader Has Become Much Less Impressive Throughout His Post OT Appearances

1655932551,"I'm aware that, narratively, the Force is more of an analogy for what George Lucas describes as the difference between pleasure and joy, the Dark being pleasure and the Light being joy. Pleasure is quick to obtain, but always leaves you empty and wanting more, while the Light is something you build up for a long time and is wholly fulfilling.

But in the stories, as a system of magic, I've never really been able to wrap my head around the exact ""why"" the Sith are always evil and the Dark Side can't be used for good. The Dark Side is driven primarily by emotional expression and ambition, mainly things like fear and anger, but these aren't inherently evil emotions and we know drawing upon them, and therefore the Dark Side, and with temperance people like Luke Skywalker can tap into it and use it to great effect, like defeating Darth Vader in their rematch once provoked about Leia.

I understand the emotion trap, like how Anakin was covetous of Padme and sought Sidious for power to save her, but I've never understood why someone couldn't just walk up to a Sith and say ""Hey there, I would like to learn about your magic, please"" and walk away fine. In Legends we have Darth Vectivus, who was just a shrewd businessman and never really did anything evil, and from the films one could argue Dooku is less evil and more disillusioned with the Jedi Council and the Senate (though still not the best example, given him serving Mr. Sheevie Jeebies). Vapaad was a form of combat made by Mace Windu after studying the Dark Side, and even Luke Skywalker in both canons preaches a form of balance that guides his New Jedi Order, albeit Light-focused.

So I guess, what gives? If it's just a narrative thing that makes sense, but in practice it seems the Dark Side is less of a cosmic corruption trap and more a set of techniques that draw on things the Jedi frown upon.",StarWars,"I don't understand the Force, especially the Dark Side."

1655927873,"...and I love it for it. Complaints about Star Wars becoming ""political"" keep popping up with every new project announced, and while I hardly need to convince anyone here how redundant these statements are, it got me thinking: Star Wars is probably the mainstream media franchise most overt about its themes. George Lucas unapologetically shoves his beliefs down our throats in the 6 movies he created. His politics and ethics are absolutely essential to the story of Star Wars, so much so that he literally baked them into the metaphysics of the universe with the Force.

The light/dark dichotomy of the Force is a reflection of Lucas' morals. The light side of the Force is characterized by selflessness while the dark side is all about selfishness. To use the Force for selfish desires is to tap into the dark side, leading to corruption, leading to the influence of the dark side growing stronger. It's a spiral, the desire for power creates a stronger desire for even more power, hurting countless innocents in the process. In order to remain good, one must let go of all the things one fears to lose and become truly selfless. That doesn't mean being unable to love, but accepting that all things must end sometimes, and when that time comes, let go. George Lucas is telling us to not be selfish assholes.

And of course, the actual politics of Star Wars are super preachy too. The death of a democracy is an immense tragedy and the Prequel Trilogy presents it with such pathos, such grandiose drama, I can't help but awe every time I rewatch RotS. It's stuff like intercutting the fires of Mustafar, this apocalyptic imagery, with Palpatine physically disassembling the Senate in his duel with Yoda. You can just tell that Lucas absolutely **hates** what is happening, he's framing the fall of the republic alongside the end of the world, or hell, if you will. Then there's the end of AotC, where he plays the imperial march over the sweeping shot showing off the Clone Army. These are the good guys, but this army, this war, really represents the end of the Republic. It was over here and there, this war but a tool for Palpatine to grasp more power. It's through stuff like that you can also tell he just absolutely **hates** war. 

Lucas is aggressively telling us to cherish and protect our democracies, and I think these days, with so many people seemingly forgetting that liberty is not a given, it is of utmost importance that we keep showing these movies to younger generations, so they too, can see what Lucas was preaching about.",StarWars,Star Wars is incredibly preachy

1655924620,"Am I alone in thinking that the new prop lightsabers they use for filming look different (if not worse) than the ones they used in the OT/prequels?

A lightsaber is a contained beam of energy ‚Äî more pale than colorful, that gives off some color in close quarters but doesn‚Äôt drape everything in color.


Moreover, there is a discernible difference in the way the actors handle them as opposed to the old props (presumably because they‚Äôre heavier).
Initially, I thought this was because Disney deliberately changed the style of lightsaber fighting in the sequels to resemble the clunky style of the OT, but even the fighting in Kenobi appeared considerably more clunky and labored than the prequels. By contrast, Vaders Rogue One lightsaber use (in which an OT style prop lightsaber was used) looked much more fluid and natural. What‚Äôs more, the lighting they added in in post looked very natural.

One example were Obi-Wan putting up a fight against Darth Vader on the Death Star up until he sees that Luke is watching them, then he just gives in.

Another example was Yoda trying to dissuade Luke from leaving Dagobah because ""his training isn't finished"". But when he returns he is suddenly ""ready"" and Yoda dies before Lukes eyes.

Another example was Darth Vader after killing the emperor and Luke is dragging him to the ship. He asks Luke to remove his helmet so he can see him with his own eyes, and then dies before him.

But considering that ""Star Wars"" (the original trilogy at least) carried themes on redemption (Han, Lando, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Darth ""Youngling-Killing-Planet-Destroying""Vader), the chance for Charal being redeemed shouldn't sound too far-fetched. The real question is what to do after the redemption?

Say that the redemption story happened shortly after ""Return Of The Jedi""; Luke would find a way to change her backing a human and maybe even offered her friendship and a part in his New Jedi Academy. Would Charal except the offers or decide to live in self-exile for all the murders she had took part in with Terak?

But, if she does except, would Leia and the others be willing to give her a chance? 

Then there's Cindel; she could end up being Leia's student in diplomacy or get a occupation that could her to meeting Luke and then Charal. Would Luke try to get Cindel to forgive the Witch or understand her feelings and not stress forgiveness so much?

And what about the rest of the galaxy; would Luke redeeming a witch lead to distrust from other planets? Especially if it's made public of Anakin being Darth Vader and Luke and Leia being his children?

1655910973,"Most light saber users use slash‚Äôs over thrusts even if thrusts would be more efficient because lightsabers are nearly weightless and cut through anything. Basically they should be used as rapiers rather then short swords (since there one handed).

Qui gon was also left to bleed out for minutes before he died so if oni wan just force griped maul down the shaft he could have saved him once the barrier opened back up. 

All the dark Jedi/Sith who‚Äôve been stabbed walked it off.

If young reva was indeed stabbed by Vader she could have tapped into the dark side to save her life like exar kun did in legends.

All the other people who been stabbed with a light saber where jobber Jedi and regular joes (Radom Padawan who got killed by yellow maul and that one guy ventress stabbed), could also be used for censorship reasons because they couldn‚Äôt show someone getting sliced in half on screen, same reason the jedi are never seen actually slicing people in half outside of the comics.

Meanwhile blaster shots are way more lethal since they don‚Äôt Cauterise (don‚Äôt know how you spell that) meaning you lose a lot more blood, there also are a lot wider and less precise then a saber stab. That‚Äôs way blaster shots to the chest always kill.

1655905179,"Like many, I was the victim of a 10-year Star Wars drought since the release of Episode III in 2005. Naturally I was going to enjoy anything they put in theaters for new Star Wars. I went to see TFA 7 times in theaters. I loved it. Now I realize it was out of pure nostalgia. That movie looked nice, but it set new Star Wars on a course for failure and it can all be tracked back to the lack of vision by the higher ups: Kennedy, Abrams, etc. 

Have you ever noticed the title ""The Force Awakens"" makes no sense for the film itself? Unless you consider OP Rey Awakens the real title. No for me, The Force Awakens was a title that gave me hope in the next generation of Star Wars.

The Force Awakens calls forth an idea that has still yet to be touched on in New Star Wars. I mean, why go forward when it's so easy to back and ruin old characters with moneygrab shows?

With the empire gone and the jedi order eradicated that leaves one simple fact....Force Sensitive people are AWAKENING without any proper way to identify them and educate them. This should've been the focus of the new trilogy. Not the fIrST oRdEr, but Luke Skywalker's quest to help a galaxy cope with Force Sensitive people running amok bc they don't know what they are. If unchecked would they naturally fall to the darkside? Could a new Sith lord prey upon this notion? This premise alone opens the doors to all sorts of new worlds and characters.

To be frank, I thought this is where the new trilogy was headed. Once the drought was over and we became over-saturated with new Star Wars content it became clear the future of Star Wars is to dwell in the past. It's sad to say but this has really started to sour me on Star Wars culminating with the mishandling of Obi-Wan. 

We've now entered into the age of high-production value fan fiction Star Wars and its cheapened the characters and stories we grew up with that came directly from the creator's (GL's) head.

TL:DR Disney is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars. Force Awakens is a better title than movie.

That position appears to have already been filled. Given the time frame of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rebels, and A New Hope there isn't much time for Galen to be found by Vader, raised and taught to use the dark side, and then spend years hunting down Jedi before his redemption story begins. The idea of Galen existing as a secret apprentice while the Inquisitors already have the same exact purpose as him is hard to swallow.

I like Rogue One, but why do we need a Cassian Andor show? He's not a popular character, he's not iconic, and the show is about the incredibly overdone Rebels vs. Empire conflict. Even if the show is good, it will inevitably feel stale.

The Skeleton Crew show that comes out next year sounds completely unnecessary. It has been described as ""Stranger Things meets Star Wars"" which means Disney are probably just trying to copy Stranger Things because of its success.

I could go on and on. There's the Lando show, and the Rangers show (that only got canned because of Gina Carano.) Now there are strong rumours of a Reva show... a spin off of a spin off, featuring a character who was just introduced and isn't notably popular. There's also rumours of a Darth Maul show and even a Cal Kestis show.

IMO, Disney should cut down to a max of two live-action Star Wars shows per year. I think the current rapid output is causing the quality to suffer.",StarWars,Do you think Disney are milking Star Wars too much with all of these Disney+ spin off shows?

That means that Ben was right when he told Luke, that Vader killed his father. So when Vader tells Luke, that he didn't killed his father, because he is Luke's father, it doesn't contradicts with his statement in kenobi, it's more of admission that he has turned back to Anakin, struggling with the fight between light and dark.

But Star Wars really needs to step away from the characters we know and love in favor of new ones. The best example I have is Mando vs everything else TV wise. I enjoyed Kenobi even if it had it's weak points, and it was much better than BoBF, but despite the cool interactions between Obi and Anakin/Vader, Obi and Leia, heck just about every major/minor player in the show, you can never really escape the knowledge of the ultimate fate of these characters, the stakes just aren't there. That's what I believe mando enjoys the benefit of, being a new character along with baby Yoda. The stakes are there, the mystery of both characters, the interest in their back stories are there, the growth of those characters are ever present (Not to take away the growth of Ben/Obi as a character in this show). It really makes for better stories/TV to have fresh stories and characters imo.

Tl;dr - How do I organize watching the prequel trilogy and a condensed version of The Clone Wars simultaneously?",StarWars,How do you do a Condensed Viewing of The Clone Wars?

1655880386,"Everytime Star Wars disappointed fans in recent years it was ""Disney did this"" or ""Disney needs to stop that"" as if Lucasfilm doesn't make the majority of the writing and narrative decisions, as well as hire the directors and writers in the first place

Everyone praised Facreu for Mandalorian, but then blamed Diseny for the shortcomings on Book of Boba Fett despite Favreu leading both projects 

When Marvel makes a lackluster film nobody tries to blame Disney for it

It's not like Mickey Mouse is standing over Favreu and Filoni telling them to make rewrites, that's the board of Lucasfilm and the producers",StarWars,Why does every try to lay all the blame on Disney instead of Lucasfilm?

1655878235,A few weeks ago the YouTuber Solar Sands made a video on battle droids and how they‚Äôre mistreated. One of his arguments were why the separatists would design robots that develop sentience and could feel fear and refuse orders. About 50% of the comments were just explaining how he‚Äôs wrong because there‚Äôs a explanation for it in canon. Even if a canon explanation exists that does not make the writing immune to criticism and does not ‚Äúfix‚Äù the flawed logic of the universe. Yeah droids are made to follow their programming and develop personalities through experience. That does not make his criticism of WHY an army would be designed like that wrong and doesn‚Äôt excuse what I see as poor world building.,StarWars,Just because something is ‚Äúcanon‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it makes logical sense from a writing perspective and doesn‚Äôt make it a good explanation.

Prediction #1 (my favorite): A duel between Darth Vader and Obi Wan, however, it‚Äôs different. Last episode was just a hint that Obi Wan still knows how to best Anakin. The duel is gonna be Obi Wan on the defensive the whole time, dropping witty remarks. This will be a cover for people to escape, and right before Obi Wan leaves he‚Äôll say something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still the apprentice Anakin‚Äù to remind him he‚Äôs still number 2, he can still be be beaten and has a lot to learn. 

This ties together why he says ‚Äúwhen I left you I was but the learner now I am the master‚Äù in episode 4 when he‚Äôs stronger and ready to kill the emperor and rule the galaxy with Luke (once he finds out he exists) as his apprentice.

Prediction #2: The Rebellion shows up. Something along the lines of saving the day whilst the Vader Obi Wan duel is going on. We forget this takes place only 10 years before ANH, the rebellion is still a thing and there‚Äôs still a war going on between them and the empire. We also saw a rebellion helmet from the pilot Reva killed, that was just a hint.

Prediction #3: You guessed it, Qui Gon appearance. Whether as a voice or actually there, he gonna be there. 

Prediction #4 (bold one): Some sort of early on Clone Wars flashback with Anakin, Obi Wan, and young Ahsoka.

I get why people don't like them, and it's a bit more scientific than just an invisible presence that binds the galaxy together. HOWEVER, after watching Kenobi and hearing his explanation for what the force feels like...it clicked with me that the force is still the presence so eloquently described in A New Hope, and the Jedi truly believe that it is as described by Ben. Qui-Gon chooses to see the Force at its scientific level because he no longer is disillusioned by the egotistical nature of the Jedi Order. Instead, he prefers to side with the solid evidence of what creates the force at its core (or at least what is considered to be the source of power) instead of the overall concept. Even though Obi-Wan reads the results of Anakin's midi-chlorian count to Qui-Gon, it's merely superficial for him. By Episode II, he's solely pushing the force as a greater power, not something quantified by lab results. So, actually, midi-chlorians are perfectly acceptable for Star Wars, and clearly demonstrates the divide between the height of the Jedi and the beginning of their downfall on a scientific level.",StarWars,Defending Midi-chlorians!?
1655874247,"As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm not as in love with the Star Wars movies (1-6) as I was when I was younger. The sequels look great visually but the story is just wild and kinda ridiculous. I adore the video games, TV shows, and expanded universe and lore. But the movies are a bit too cheesy. I do realize they are made for kids and that‚Äôs when I was obsessed with them. But I‚Äôm even losing the nostalgia magic for them. Does anyone feel this same way? I was born in 98‚Äô and grew up with the prequels mostly and was always a big fan of the original trilogy as well. The original Star Wars Battlefront 1&amp;2, Knights of the Old Republic, and Force Unleashed are some of my favorite games when I was younger and I still love all of those. The movies have just gotten a bit dry for me. Does anyone else feel this way or am I just weird? Not trying to be controversial. It‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve been feeling lately reconnecting to these films with my 5yr old son. We have been playing OG battlefront together though and that has been a blast!",StarWars,I enjoy the expanded Star Wars universe but have lost interest in the movies.
1655873705,"It's something I've noticed since the Sequel Trilogy &gt;!that carried forward into Luke's appearance in The Mandalorian and then again in Kenobi.!&lt; The lightsabers are starting to feel a little more solid, like sticks, and I'm not one-hundred percent sure why. 

**Is this something you're noticing as well?**

&amp;#x200B;

The technology is obviously improving, and I wonder if that's what's doing it. Perhaps, because the light glows a little more realistically and the effects are more consistent between each shot, the blade has begun to feel a little more defined, less fantasy-like and more of a solid object. 

It's no big deal. The lightsabers always changed in every major saga movie before the sequel trilogy (E.g. the blades got thicker in the prequels; Maul's was orange at times; Anakin's was dark blue later in the trilogy, etc.) and that might contribute to this feeling I'm getting now that they're all very consistent after The Force Awakens, but I'm not sure I want them to suddenly all feel exactly the same *all the time*.

&amp;#x200B;

What I miss is that bright core, the white light down the centre of the blade with that gradual blurry glow into whichever colour around the core. I miss the teeter, the sort of wavering flicker (almost like a campfire or candle) or visual vibrations they had like real light that was being bound into a blade but always on the verge of breaking out, maintained within a barely-stable field. The flicker is still there, but its so subtle now; the shape never quite changes like it used to, and the colour around the blade extends so far around the environment that it lacks that vibrant blur of blue, green or red that normally wraps tightly around the white.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Am I making any sense here?

Maybe I'll link some images to compare:

[A New Hope](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/92/Lukesaberanh.png/revision/latest?cb=20130228054320) compared with [The Last Jedi](https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ep8-ff-006225_8c6a1dd3.jpeg)

[Return of the Jedi](https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/luke-skywalker-lightsaber-1536x864.jpg) compared with [Rise of Skywalker](http://www.scififantasynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rey-yellow-lightsaber.jpg)

[Revenge of the Sith](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFPT85uiW3q48b3a5BaiFJ.jpg) compared with [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b637c76e17ba3724ec64dcb/1b303651-1553-4692-9eb4-c764f0c79aac/star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-episode-3-duel2.jpg?format=1000w)

In each comparison, the modern version has its light react more like we'd expect it to in real life, but it loses that brightness at its core and the typical wrap of vibrant colour around the blade that we're traditionally used to.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise this is such a minuscule thing, but it's an observation I made early on and I always seem to notice and feel it. It's a non-issue, to be sure, but it does distract me from the stories I'm otherwise quite enjoying. &gt;!I love seeing Luke, Obi-Wan and Vader again.!&lt; I'm eager as heckle to see what becomes of the new characters we are being introduced to. But I am a bit distracted whenever there is a lightsaber on-screen, and I kind of hope it's addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you feel the same? Am I just crazy? What do you think has caused this? Do you prefer any particular design or special effect from across the films and television series over any other?** 

What's your favourite lightsaber effect? Which film or series best represented lightsabers for you? Would you prefer any specific effect to be the standard? How might you change the current lightsaber visuals (if at all)?

What stands out the most watching on a big TV is that it was a sad waste of eyeball resolving capacity every time I watched them on a laptop.  For some reason the prequels don't seem silly to me now.  Maybe it's the immersiveness of a bigger screen, and maybe it's having a better understanding these days of Palpatine's maneuverings.   Watching react vids of younger people helped a lot.

Pausing during any shot is a feast for the eyes, especially the establishing shots, but most especially in the middle of a wipe.  Some of those are hilarious.  

Anakin and Padme's love scenes always felt off.  This time around it seems like it's because Padme's seeing what she wants to see, and Anakin's affect is weird and disturbing, like his ""love"" is greedy possessiveness.

In ANH, when the Imps learn who the droids were sold to on Tattoine, did they report it to Vader?  ""You're saying Owen.  Freaking.  Lars.  Bought those robots?""  

These and other questions are ones to which we do not need serious answers.  

Yoda murdering two red guards by waving his hand is funnier than all the gags in Spaceballs put together.  Palpatine landing with his butt in the air is almost as funny.  

Obi Wan took the high ground on Mustafar because he was mindful of his surroundings and was the first to spot the opportunity.  All Anakin saw was Obi Wan.

CHAPTER ONE

The flashback to Order 66 in the Jedi Temple is the same. 

On TATOOINE, OBI-WAN wakes from a terrible dream. He has closed himself off from the force, a shadow of his former self. He does check in on young LUKE, but he is not concerned about his training. His survivor‚Äôs guilt has caused him to truly turn his back on the Jedi and their ways. 

REVA and THE INQUISITORS arrive in Mos Eisley to hunt down a FUGITIVE JEDI. Her tactics are brutal, as are the other inquisitors. The THIRD BROTHER only asks them to tread carefully. They need him alive to gather crucial intelligence, a direct order from DARTH VADER at the behest of THE EMPEROR.

On ALDERAAN, we‚Äôre still introduced to young LEIA. The beats from her role in the first episode remain largely the same, except we see some more overt hints that she‚Äôs strong with the force. We still see that BAIL ORGANA is attempting to play both sides and remains a man of influence. However, the kidnapping plot is not connected to Reva in any way. The perpetrators are discharged CLONE TROOPERS, and they‚Äôre capturing Leia‚Äîthe daughter of a senator‚Äîfor ransom and leverage against the Empire. They seek reparations for the discarded clone army. 

Back on Tatooine, Obi-Wan has visited the town for supplies and witnesses the Inquisitors smoke out the fugitive Jedi. Reva engages him in the town square and quickly bests him in battle, severing his hand. Obi-Wan, for the first time in years, is moved to act. But he knows he cannot. 

Reva, with her fellow Inquisitors behind her, interrogates the Jedi in front of the crowded square, ‚ÄúWE KNOW ABOUT THE PATH!‚Äù The intelligence the Inquisitors seek is about an underground network that helps force-sensitive beings escape the empire. The Jedi is silent‚Äîhe won‚Äôt break. It‚Äôs no matter to Reva, who can pry information from people‚Äôs minds using the force. But, as she raises her hand, the Jedi‚Äîusing the last of his energy‚Äîuses the force to pull his fallen light saber, ignite it, and impale himself through the back of the chest. A sacrifice.

The three Inquisitors, furious, leave. Obi-Wan heads back into the desert. That night, he has nightmares‚Äîflashes of Reva severing the Jedi's hand remind him of his violent final moments with Anakin. The light saber piercing the Jedi's chest conjures images of how he helplessly watched QUI-GON JINN die. He wakes, screaming, ‚ÄúQUI-GON?!‚Äù 

A hooded figure stands in his dwelling. Removing his hood, it‚Äôs revealed to be Bail Organa‚Äîhe is desperate and Obi-Wan is his only‚Ä¶option. The Empire is already closely watching him, and he cannot risk involving them in the ransom plot. They‚Äôve become too adept at sensing potential force users and Leia is showing. 

Obi-Wan is terrified. But he knows Bail is right‚Äîthis is his duty. And, with the sacrifice of the fugitive Jedi freshly seared into his mind, he agrees to help. He recovers his light saber from the sands of Tatooine and heads towards the transport station at Mos Eisley. END. 

CHAPTER TWO

The four CLONE TROOPERS arrive with the kidnapped LEIA on DAIYU‚Äîa planet bustling with crime. They‚Äôre rough with Leia, but the leader of the outfit doesn‚Äôt want her hurt. This was a desperate move, but he‚Äôs conflicted. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs keeping the others in check.  

OBI-WAN arrives, and begins his search for Leia, following the same beats of episode two. He‚Äôs led to HAJA, still a fake Jedi, and asks him if he‚Äôs heard anything about clone troopers and a kidnapping. Haja hasn‚Äôt but he knows a former imperial officer who‚Äôs now very well connected in the crime world. For a few credits, he‚Äôll bring Obi-Wan to her. 

Elsewhere, at FORTRESS INQUISITORIOUS, REVA and the THIRD BROTHER are arguing over who to blame for their failure on Tatooine. ‚ÄúYou both are,‚Äù sneers the GRAND INQUISITOR, gliding into the room. Reva and the others kneel. The Grand Inquisitor goes on to inform them that DARTH VADER will be most disappointed that they failed to turn up anything useful. As Reva attempts to make excuses, the Grand Inquisitor stops her, ‚ÄúYou may tell him yourself. He‚Äôs on his way.‚Äù

LEIA, tied up, is helped to a drink of water by the clone trooper leader, who doesn‚Äôt have a name, but she can call him ‚ÄúCT.‚Äù She‚Äôs still the plucky kid we see in the current series, and we can see that CT is taking a liking to her. We get some exposition about the plight of the clone troopers. His fellow troops interrupt. They‚Äôre anxious, antsy, and desperate to know what the next move is. Without CT there, Leia can feel that her life is in real danger. 

Haja takes Obi-Wan deeper into the underworld, where they meet TALA, a former officer turned crime lord. Tala is flanked by ROKEN, her right-hand man. ‚ÄúWhy do you look familiar,‚Äù he says. Obi-Wan shares vague details of the kidnapping plot, but he won‚Äôt reveal his identity or who he‚Äôs searching for. This only frustrates Tala, making her suspicious of Obi-Wan‚Äôs motivations. As she angrily confronts Haja about wasting her time, Roken interrupts, ‚ÄúI KNEW‚Ä¶YOU‚ÄôRE‚Ä¶YOU‚ÄôRE GENERAL KENOBI!‚Äù 

Tala has heard the name‚Äîthe legend‚Äîbefore, but she remains deeply suspicious. Roken disappears. The crashing of boxes and canisters can be heard. He quickly returns with something. Giving it to Tala, she outstretches her hand. It‚Äôs a communicator, and Obi-Wan‚Äôs distorted, crackling image appears warning Jedi to stay away from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Taken aback, Obi-Wan asks, ‚ÄúHo..how do you have that?‚Äù

The argument between CT and the other clone troopers is at a boiling point. They accuse CT of not having a plan beyond the kidnapping. ‚ÄúWhat if that elitist senator won‚Äôt pay the ransom?! Then what?!‚Äù Leia‚Äôs heart races‚Äîfear. CT tries to bring down the tension by asking for more time. ‚ÄúI bet if we send Organa her little finger, he‚Äôll speed things up!‚Äù He lunges toward Leia, and before CT can react to defend, Leia screams, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TOUCH ME!‚Äù

The clone trooper stops, frozen, before muttering, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt touch her.‚Äù  Mere blocks away, Obi-Wan clutches his chest. 

Back in the clone trooper hideout, the stunned trooper grabs his head and slumps into a nearby chair. CT and the other troopers stand in stunned silence. ‚ÄúSH‚Ä¶SHE HAS POWERS,‚Äù stammers one of the troopers. CT looks deeply into Leia‚Äôs eyes. The other trooper chimes in, almost laughing, ‚ÄúDO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EMPIRE PAYS FOR INFORMATION ON THESE PEOPLE, LET ALONE THE PEOPLE!‚Äù CT, still looking at Leia, puts his hand on his holstered blaster. ‚ÄúDo you know what they do to these people,‚Äù CT says coldly. 

The force-stunned trooper finally rises from his chair, and together, the three troopers aim their weapons at CT. ‚ÄúThe plan was never to hurt the child,‚Äù says CT. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be hurting her,‚Äù one retorts. CT gives one last plea to reason, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a chance we walk away from this rich.‚Äù  

‚ÄúSorry, chief, I‚Äôd much rather go with the guarantee.‚Äù A barrage of blaster fire unleashes on CT. Without thinking, he flips a metal table, separating him and Leia from the others. ‚ÄúWHAT GOOD WILL A DEAD GIRL DO YOU,‚Äù shouts CT. The blaster fire stops. Again, CT‚Äôs eyes meet Leia‚Äôs, as if to say he‚Äôs sorry for what‚Äôs next. He begins to undo her restraints. ‚ÄúI TELL YOU WHAT‚ÄîFREE PASS. LEAVE THE GIRL AND WALK AWAY. NOTHIN‚Äô ON YOUR CONSCIENCE,‚Äù yells a trooper. 

CT pops up from behind the table, shocking the troopers who stand opposite. ‚ÄúLike I said, what good will a dead girl do you?‚Äù He slowly backs out of the room, holding Leia like a human shield with a blaster to her head. In the hallway, CT shoots the keypad, slamming the door. With Leia, in his arms, he begins to sprint. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to hurt you,‚Äù he wheezes. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù says Leia. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll get through that door‚Ä¶‚Äù CT says breathlessly. There‚Äôs a large blast. CT continues, ‚Äú‚Ä¶fast.‚Äù

Obi-Wan is still clutching his chest. Tala and Roken are saying something, but he‚Äôs not listening. She used the force. She‚Äôs in danger. A large blast rings in the near distance. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs there,‚Äù and Obi-Wan sprints from the chamber. Tala and Roken exchange looks before following in pursuit. Haja‚Äîbeing Haja‚Äîdoes not. 

CT, with Leia under his arms like a loose sack of potatoes, shoots wildly behind him. His former squad mates are catching up. CT can‚Äôt outrun them. Ducking down another alley, he spots a fire escape. Shooting the ladder sends it crashing to the ground. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt outrun them,‚Äù he says to Leia. ‚ÄúYou go up there and you hide.‚Äù He sets Leia on the ground, and they share a knowing look. ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù he says. A blaster bolt whizzes by his head, ‚ÄúGO NOW!‚Äù Leia goes up the ladder. 

Sprinting his way through crowded streets, Obi-Wan hears blaster fire in the distance. Red flashes fill a not-too-distant cross street. Obi-Wan needs to move.  

One of the attacking clone troopers shouts, ‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôS HEADING FOR THE ROO‚Ä¶‚Äù CTs blaster bolt connects with his shoulder, sending him spiraling backward. CT and the remaining two clones exchange gunfire. Another of his shots makes contact‚Äîthis time fatal‚Äîwhich causes him to feel a moment of anguish. The moment was all the other trooper needed. CT is hit in the chest, sending him to the ground, dead. ‚ÄúNO,‚Äù rings from the roof. Leia‚Äîhonorably, naively‚Äîwaited to see if CT would be ok.

Obi-Wan hears it as he turns the corner. A clone trooper lays still in the alleyway, while another has almost ascended a ladder to the roof. 

Leia runs, but the trooper is closing in. She hops from rooftop to rooftop until she slides to a halt‚Äîthe gap to the next roof is too wide. ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS ENOUGH,‚Äù he yells, out of breath. ‚ÄúYou ‚Ä¶ are ‚Ä¶ coming ‚Ä¶ with me.‚Äù Leia, facing the lone trooper, steps backward towards the roof‚Äôs edge. ‚ÄúTHAT FALL WILL KILL YOU!‚Äù Leia, defiantly, shouts, ‚ÄúYOU WILL KILL ME!‚Äù She takes another step back. ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT BE STUPID,‚Äù yells the trooper. ‚ÄúTHE FORCE WILL PROTECT ME!‚Äù She takes another step back, onto the air, and begins to fall. 

A blaster bolt hits the trooper from behind. As he falls to his knees, Obi-Wan sprints past, throwing the blaster away. His eyes meet Leia‚Äôs as her face dips beneath the roofline. He slides, his hand outstretched. He‚Äôs far too late to catch her. He keeps his hand outstretched and, for a moment, abandons fear. Because, at this moment, the only thing that matters is the safety of the child he swore to protect. Leia‚Äôs body magically slows to a halt in midair, protected by the force, as she believed.

A. Towns and side quests- I‚Äôm gonna lump these two together since they‚Äôd probably be connected.

Obviously for the planets they go to they present good reasons for this since imperials would generally have already cleared out any towns you already visited. However, I feel like it made the universe feel somewhat small and like there wasn‚Äôt really much within the universe. This would also allow for maybe the introduction of side quests, which would encourage more general exploration of the worlds, outside of finding more ponchos.

For the longest time it was only two Jedi that made it. Obi Wan and Yoda. Not sure if more, my Star Wars knowledge isn‚Äôt the best.

Back then, Order 66 felt like this cataclysmic event that two of the greatest masters of the Order survived. Then came Ahsoka. It makes sense that the Chosen Ones apprentice could make it. Then came grogu and Kanen, then Cal Kestis, the Jedi at the beginning of Kenobi, Reva, and now Gungi.

I completely understand that there were so many Jedi in the galaxy not even including younglings and that some could slip through the cracks. Sidious is the villian and should have imperfections. However it feels every year we get a new Jedi that survived O66, and it feels less impactful. This is a mastermind that was plotting to bring back the Sith from a millennium of hiding in the shadows. I would like to think his ultimate trap would be a little more foolproof.

As for Luke‚Äôs story I also understand that both Yoda and Obi wan were only aware of Luke being capable of taking on Vader/The Emperor. However the aspect and stakes of him being the last of the Jedi becomes less pronounced knowing the other Jedi out there.

1655832571,"I'm a bit confused how parts of the duel between Vader and Luke are developed in Episode 6.

At a certain scene, Luke grabs his lightsaber with the force and attempts to kill the emperor, but then Vader uses his lightsaber to stop him.

It seems from comics and other media like Vader had intention to betray the Emperor; but even not taking them into attention he goes in the previous movie so far as to tell Luke this 'rule the galaxy as father and son' phrase. So why does he even attempt to block? It seems like Luke had a pretty good shot to kill the Emperor there and then.

The second question is about what happened with the lightsabers. I can understand that Vader's may have been lost from the moment he gets his mechanical arm cut off, but the moment he decides to betray the Emperor... couldn't he have force grabbed his son's lightsaber instead of exposing him like he did? It's a silly way to die, I think he would have had enough time to kill the Emperor given that he was busy cooking Luke.

My last question is about something that also happens in Episode 9. The Emperor mentions that they would turn to the dark side if they strike him down. Why so? Particularly in Episode 6, Luke seems very level headed for the situation, why would he instantly be evil right after stopping this whole thing? I find it really hard to understand.

Then Leia and Luke in an attempt to avenge their father become Jedi and destroy both evil Kenobi and Palpatine in a 2v2 situation.

In V and VI his goal is to bring his son to the Dark side, but he still doesn't have a reason to be so into the Dark Side. 

Than the prequels came out and gave vader a reason for joining the darkside: save padme. But then padme dies, and it is believed that so did her kids.

And now, it is canon that vader doesn't have a motivation.

Now, its not that hard to extrapolate a motivation from the prequels. Maybe he wants revenge on the jedi he lost faith in, on Obi wan who has caused him so much pain, on Sidious who is started the chain of dominoes ruined his life.

# 1. Introduction

Star Wars: Rebels offers a more in-depth look at the Rebellion brewing right before the Episode IV: A New Hope, where thousands of rebels joined in an attempt to destroy the tyrannical Empire and its leaders.

The TV Show, while done for kids, provides complex topics that teens and adults alike will find interesting and worth their time. As always, it also expands the lore of the Galaxy and some key characters and planets.

This post will serve as a guide to watch the Rebels episodes in several orders: chronological (with an essentials version), Skywalker Saga and State of the Universe.

*You can check out this post where these orders are explained and listed with other TV Shows and Films!*

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Complete Chronological Order

Star Wars: Rebels (contrary to The Clone Wars) is in chronological order already! This means that each season and episode happens one after the other in the Star Wars Timeline. In any case, here is the list!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Season 1** \- *Episode 1 through 15*
2. **Season 2** \- *Episode 1* *through 22*
3. **Season 3** \- *Episode 1 through 22*
4. **Season 4** \- *Episode 1* *through 15*

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Essential Chronological Order

This one still follows the chronological order but has very specific episodes that are the heart and soul of the TV Show. If for whatever reason you do not want or cannot commit to the whole show, this is your best bet.

*Most seasons have a lot of filler or unimportant episodes except for Season 4. All but one episode from Season 4 are really important and with lots of key events.*

# 4. Skywalker Saga Order

Star Wars: Rebels is focused very little on the Skywalker Family and because of that the list of relevant episodes for the Skywalker Saga order is so small. A lot of content is cut here but it's the most relevant to look into the family and Vader mainly. You can read all about the Skywalker Saga Order in this post.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Season 2** \- *Episode 1* \- 'The Siege of Lothal, Part 1'
2. **Season 2** \- *Episode 2* \- 'The Siege of Lothal, Part 2'
3. **Season 2** \- *Episode 10* \- 'The Future of the Force'
4. **Season 2** \- *Episode 12* \- 'A Princess on Lothal'
5. **Season 2** \- *Episode 18* \- 'Shroud of Darkness'
6. **Season 2** \- *Episode 21* \- 'Twilight of the Apprentice, Part 1'

8. **Season 3** \- *Episode 20* \- 'Twin Suns'

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Introduction

From films, TV shows, audiobooks, novels and games, the Canon Star Wars has been rapidly growing.

However, the growth has not followed a straight, easy-to-follow chronological line. The films have jumped from prequel to sequel trilogies, while the TV Shows are just places wherever. For Star Wars fans, it's sometimes hard to follow where certain events are happening in the timeline but for newcomers it feels like an impossible thing to do.

I've worked on this post for a few weeks now, mostly because many of my friends have become recently interested in Star Wars and want to know the right order to watch it. It's a bit frustrating not knowing what to answer from the top of my head and I felt it was the right choice to take my time and give them and any other newcomers an easy-to-use guide to watch Star Wars in a way that best suits them.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Complete Release Order

This is very straightforward. The Release Order just gets you the whole Star Wars experience exactly how it was released. This means that you will get to see Episode IV before Episode I, II and III. This is the most watched order because...well Star Wars is still and ongoing franchise and new content is released yearly, which happens chronologically between other content released before.

&amp;#x200B;

1. (1977) Episode IV: A New Hope
2. (1980) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
3. (1983) Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
4. (1999) Episode I: The Phantom Menace
5. (2002) Episode II: Attack of the Clones
6. (2005) Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
7. (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Film)
8. (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV Show)
9. (2014) Star Wars: Rebels (TV Show)
10. (2015) Episode VII: The Force Awakens
11. (2016) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
12. (2017) Star Wars: Forces of Destiny (TV Show)
13. (2017) Episode VII: The Last Jedi
14. (2018) Solo: A Star Wars Story
15. (2018) Star Wars: Resistance (TV Show)
16. (2019) The Mandalorian (TV Show)
17. (2019) Episode XI: The Rise of Skywalker
18. (2021) Star Wars: The Bad Batch (TV Show)
19. (2021) The Book of Boba Fett (TV Show)
20. (2022) Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV Show)

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Essential Release Order

This Order is the same as the one before but cutting a lot of content that is not essential to understand the Star Wars franchise. The content removed from here makes this order a more time-friendly Star Wars experience for those not willing to commit to everything that is out there.

*While this order is a fast way to watch Star Wars and understand what it's about, it does eliminate a lot of content that provide depth to the Universe (Galaxy) in which it happens. You would be missing things and events that while not essential, make Star Wars much more enjoyable.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. (1977) Episode IV: A New Hope
2. (1980) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
3. (1983) Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
4. (1999) Episode I: The Phantom Menace
5. (2002) Episode II: Attack of the Clones

9. (2016) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
10. (2017) Episode VII: The Last Jedi
11. (2019) The Mandalorian (TV Show)
12. (2019) Episode XI: The Rise of Skywalker

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Complete Chronological Order

Star Wars started as a trilogy of films that eventually got expanded with films and TV Shows happening before and after said trilogy. This makes understanding the timeline a bit complicated, particularly for the newcomers. This is Order is for all of you that wish to watch all Star Wars in chronological order!

&amp;#x200B;

1. (1999) Episode I: The Phantom Menace
2. (2002) Episode II: Attack of the Clones
3. (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV Show and Film) - Season 1 through 6 ^(\[1\])
4. (2005) Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Essential Chronological Order

This order is for the ones not ready to commit to all the content offered by the Star Wars Franchise. This means that a lot of content is removed to make a more time-friendly Star Wars experience.

*While this order is a fast way to watch Star Wars and understand what it's about, it does eliminate a lot of content that provide depth to the Universe (Galaxy) in which it happens. You would be missing things and events that while not essential, make Star Wars much more enjoyable.*

11. (2017) Episode VII: The Last Jedi
12. (2019) Episode XI: The Rise of Skywalker

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. Skywalker Saga Order

This order was inspired by the so-called *Machete Order*. The focus of this one is on the Skywalker family, primarily Anakin and Luke. To achieve a bigger impact on some of the big reveals, the order does not follow a chronological order or a release order, but a new one that attempts to provide a better narrative experience with the Skywalkers at the center of it all.

*It is important to note that this Order cuts out a lot of content (Films, episodes and complete TV Shows) that does not serve the purpose of enhancing the story of the Skywalker family.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. (1977) Episode IV: A New Hope
2. (1980) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. State of the Galaxy Order

A favorite of mine! This order cuts very little content and has the state of the Galaxy at the center of it all. This means that we focus on the political and social issues that the beings in Star Wars live through and how do major events come to happen. Star Wars, being pretty much a political space drama, flourishes when you make these things the focal points and not just something in the background. In my opinion, it makes it much more interesting.

So, why does this order start on **Rogue One**? Well, I believe Rogue One sets a good base as to what to expect from non-Force Users and the social and political struggles from the Galaxy under the Empire. We manage to get a (terrifying) glimpse of power from Force Users too and the Empire, which makes it a great introduction for **A New Hope.**

You might've noticed that the amount of content between **The Empire Strikes Back** and **Return of the Jedi** is quite large. As said before, the focus is not on the Skywalker Family this time, and the episodes that we see between the 2 films just help expand the understanding of what the Galaxy was going through at the moment, with a worthy culmination on **Episode VI.**

The good thing about this is that we get even more content after that, that takes on different topics that feel relevant to a Galaxy after **Return of the Jedi.**

From there, the State of the Galaxy Order works similarly to the Skywalker Saga but with added content. The most noticeable changes are on the TV Shows, where very little episodes are cut and the ones that stay offer greater depth to the Galaxy.

*As in the Skywalker Saga order, the State of the Galaxy order cuts a bit of content but not as much as the former. This order uses much more episodes from TV Shows, and cuts no films at all. In my opinion, the content that didn't make the cut was just filler.*

I will deeply apologize because I have only ever seen 1 Starwars movie, even though I know how much they are loved.  I don't have any thing against the movies, it just not my forte, so to speak.

Maybe this is because I was never as big of a fan of her as she was with other people, which is completely fine. Like what you like, but I feel like she‚Äôs everywhere, all the time. 

She was the main character in the Clone Wars. (Apart from maybe Anakin)
Was in Rebels (granted not that much)
Cameos in Mando and TBOBF.
Now she has her own show and is going to be in Tales of the Jedi and probably in Mando S3.

By the time all of that is done, she might have the most screen time out of any character in all Star Wars. (Apart from Anakin and Obi-Wan maybe? Don't fact check that.)

1655781740,"It's pretty normal to consider Empire the best of the Star Wars films, but I've come to the realization that it's really the *only* Star Wars film I would consider a cinematic masterpiece. I used to work in Hollywood, and as such am a huge film snob, especially when it comes to the technical / craft side of things, so laziness in those aspects can really drop my opinion of a movie or show. 

The [lighting](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/7b/9f/777b9f99ce20c0c6b23b05011c030646.jpg) in *Empire* is [iconic](https://i0.wp.com/www.doblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/starwarsempire14115.jpg). The editing, pacing, and script are perfect. Most scenes are advancing more than one character at the same time. Yoda is a technical achievement. The performances are all great.

Empire is not just peak Star Wars, but peak cinema. Let's roll through other popular Star Wars media and I'll briefly describe what holds them back, in my opinion, from reaching the heights of Empire. 

Before we start, I want to add that I *love* and enjoy many of these movies, but they just aren't firing on all cylinders the way I want them to be in a perfect world. And this isn't an attack on you if you love these films. This is purely my own little meditation on why I always feel vaguely disappointed in Star Wars media after having Empire set the bar.

***A New Hope***: people call the flat lighting iconic, but that's not because it's good, it's just because that's how Star Wars happened to be lit. Lots of hot highlights, and lack of shadows. Choppy editing everywhere; you can tell the stories of how they hacked the film together in ways it wasn't shot for in order to save it are true. 

Performances are super flat and stilted. Obviously the production design, score, world building, and (usually) shot composition are stellar, but it's flaws hold it back technically. 

***Return of the Jedi***: After losing the director and cinematographer from Empire, I think the lighting, performances, and direction all take a hit. Lots of overexposed or muddy shots. The awesome use of colored lighting from Empire is heavily toned down in favor of more boring white light, even in places where a giant white light source doesn't make sense, like the Throne Room.

The Ewok plotline really drags the movie's pace down, as does the Luke / Space / Endor split in how the finale is edited. *Return of the Jedi* has my favorite character moments in the entire franchise, but the lighting especially is a huge downgrade from it's predecessor.

***The Phantom Menace***: Weird cul-de-sac of a story for something launching a new trilogy. Lots of screen time devoted to story lines that don't survive this film. Breaks a lot of implied cannon from the originals that make them more disjointed on a rewatch (like it being implied in the OT that Yoda was Obi-Wan's Master instead of Qui-Gon). 

Most importantly, there aren't any strong themes in the film, which was a pillar of the OT. Those movies had something to say, even if it was a little I'm-14-and-this-is-deep at the end of the day. There's lots of attempts with all the pot shots at capitalism and politicians. But nothing rises to the level of ""fear and anger are the root of all evil"" that 
*Empire* has and ""Redemption can exist, even for the most evil"" that *Jedi* puts forth. 

The proto-digital look and effects have also not aged well. 

***Attack of the Clones***: the direction results in terrible performances, even from an academy award-winning actress. Super awkward and unbelievable romance. The Detective story manages to be both boring and have a ton of unanswered questions (the Jedi literally don't question further who really ordered this army, or find it suspicious that Palatine isn't alarmed at the Jedi having ordered it?).

For a movie that wants to be 1/3 romance, 1/3 detective story, and 1/3 political drama it completely fails at capturing the cinematic essence of any of those genres the way that ANH captures samurai movies and space operas.

Blocked and shot super boringly. 

***Revenge of the Sith***: If the last two movies had been stronger this one might have come out okay, but the weak performances and storytelling of the previous two mean the climax of the relationships here falls pretty flat. I'm not invested enough in Anakin as a hero to care about his fall. The fact that a cartoon retroactively fixes the character work here stays A LOT.

Blocking here is mildly better than the last two but nothing to write home about. 

***The Force Awakens***: The whole thing is a mess. *Awakens* basically reverses the entire climax of *Jedi* by having our heroes be the underdogs again and we are given NOTHING in the way of worldbuilding we can use to contextualize the story. They blow up a planet we have zero reason to care about.  It's a fun romp if it were a standalone generic sci Fi film, but it totally fails on building upon *Jedi* in an interesting way OR setting up a decent set of plot hooks for its own sequels. 

***The Last Jedi***: Probably the most technically competent of the 3. Really cool lighting, blocking, and shot composition. Great editing. The character work and performances between Rei, Ben, and Luke are phenomenal. The decision to rip the rug out from under Rei and make her parents nobodies was the best story choice in the trilogy. 

But it's let way down by the mediocre ship siege plot and the absolutely terrible Casino Blight sequence. 

Rian Johnson was the wrong person to make this movie, and it's an absolute shame he got pinned for the sequel trilogy's failure. There's enough awesome stuff in this film that I think if he has been allowed to just tell his own star wars story disconnected from the Skywalker thread, we would have gotten some truly cool cinema in the setting. But that probably isn't going to happen now. Ah well. 

***The Rise of Skywalker***: Barf. Worse than Season 8 of Game of Thrones. Not a single compelling moment. Fuck this movie and the Bantha it rode in on. I'm not even gonna quote the line because it would just make me angry. 

***Clone Wars: The Animated Series***: Fixes a lot of the character work from the PT, but gets dragged down by a lot of its own filler. At the end of the day, while I love this series, it was a Disney channel animated show. Does not come close to actual cinema excellence like Miyazaki or *Spiderverse*.

***Rebels***: liked it, but it's often even more disney-kiddy than Clone Wars (not a problem per-se, but keeps it from being a technical achievement pacing and story-wise).

Inherits the flat lighting from ANH as a style choice which leaves it a lot more visually uninteresting than *The Clone Wars* in a lot of cases, IMO.

***Rogue One***: Excellent second half dragged down by an absolutely disjointed first half. Ezro's arc with her father is really clumsy and unnecessarily convoluted. 

The movie *looks* phenomenal though, which almost ends up being a bad thing, as every Disney+ show looks worse for trying and failing to copy its lighting and color. 

***The Mandalorian***: Probably gets the closest of new Star Wars, but the Volume leaves the look just a little stilted, and the story has some weird pacing issues. It's not quite a single story, but not quite an episodic Bounty-of-the-week. 

***The Book of Boba Fett***: this show's best episodes are when it's literally airing episodes from another show.

Suffers heavily from Filoni-style action where people are getting shot at by 20 enemies with no cover and somehow only the one person in armor gets hit... on his armor. I guess it's fine in a kids show but it's really distracting in live action. Super lazy, boring and annoying. 

***Kenobi***: Just awful technically. Terrible blocking and shot selection in action scenes. Uneven pacing. The use of the Volume really looks uncanny-valley in this show, which is crazy because *Strange New Worlds* is also currently using it and looks [phenomenal](https://youtu.be/wtU2rHCc25o).

The senate allowed the empire to keep a semblance of democratic and administrative legitimacy, without it numerous star systems flocked to the Alliance.

1655774537,"I was wondering what people thoughts were on the state of Vader physically by 'Rogue One.' At this time, he would have spent his time training to athletic perfection his remaining muscles and becoming used to his cybernetics. Furthermore, I feel repeated Bacta Tank sessions over the last 20 years could explain why he doesn't look nearly as bad in 'Kenobi,' 'Rogue One,' V, and VI. He may even have healed himself using Dark Side techniques Sidious taught him of torturing Force-sensitives and draining their essence. 

What do you think, given the rare glimpses of him we get beneath the suit, and what his Bacta Sessions and Meditation Chamber, life is like during hours wherein he can emerge from his claustrophobia and either float weightless and with his pain eased or at least shed the upper part of his suit and sit or stand? Do you think his castle in Mustafar includes a larger version of the Meditation Chamber--with it's specially hyper-filtered air, optimal acoustics, and light filters for his eyes--wherein he actually had room to walk around and maybe practice his saber technique a bit without the weight of his upper armor and helmet for a limited time?

In episode 5 of the Obi-Wan series Obi-Wan asks Vader  upon seeing his suited form "" what have you become"" to which Vader responds "" I am what you made me.

Physical
On the surface level this line is basic. Anakin is no longer physically the man he used to be. He is missing limbs burned  ,and needs a life support system to live. He has become a robotic thing of nightmares. More machine, than Man

MentalMentally Anakin is full of rage, the physical plays into things as his pain from his wounds fill him with mental anguish. Add grief of his loss of his family. 

 He also believes that Obi-Wan betrayed him. The one person that was supposed to be there, the one that raised him. This broke Vader‚Äôs mind, having your father /brother betray you and leave you for dead would leave wounds you wouldnt heal from.

Spiritual 

He was the chosen one, he turned his back on that. He was going to be a champion of the force but is now a corruption of it. Spiritually he is so far from what he was designed to be and I think that weighs on him. He knows what potential he had. The future he could have had. The future he believe the jedi and Obi-Wan took from him.

1655762440,"so i saw a post askin people what color lightsaber theyd want, and it got me thinking if i could have any which would it be. and i think my final answer is basically the darksaber but with red around the outside instead of white (and abit thicker of a margin around the edge),

anyway, since the options on the post were really only blue green purple red i got thinkin about the darksaber  (and non default blades) and its got me wondering how much of a difference there was fighting wise:

like for general use against anything but lightsabers its somewhat worse, i mean still better than no lightsaber but because its thinner from the front it means its slightly harder to block projectiles because you are blocking with less surface area, also the handle is flat instead of circular, which is good from like swinging it forward, but for side to side movements it would be abit more annoying. for just tearing apart unarmed people its the same because you dont really need the sharp end. (which kinda gets me wondering why the exist other than just for style or to stand out).


as for fighting other lightsabers, i feel like it shrinks the amount of manoeuvres you can pull off, like if someone offered you in a fight a plank of wood, or a big stick (same size and strength and stick is like a nice stick not a rough uneven stick) youd pick the stick, the plank is gona be harder to use and probably give you blisters, your gona have alot more flexibility in the wrist moving that stick, you gona be able to put more power behind it and your gona be able yo pick it up if u from it alot more easily, also you can point it any way you want, but the darksaber had 4 faces, if your hold it weird and they land a strike on edge it could slide off way more easily

and yeh some people might give the argument that there is only one darksaber but i was recently watching the visions and there are alot of similar lightsabers that are flat like swords and it just gets me wondering what the incentive is behind it and if it was just a stylistic choice by then animators to make it look good.

or maybe im overlooking something idk",StarWars,Lightsaber Blades

1655748390,"(Copypasta of my own post because the other sub is dead and I want to discuss my theory)

Everybody says he'd be tried by the New Republic, but we all know Luke would have flown that shuttle ANYWHERE but Endor. 

(I'm going to use Canon for this, because its just easier.)

 Anakin would go into hiding. The entire galaxy knows who Darth Vader is. We all know Vader could fix and even modify his suit with nothing but a box of parts and the Force. Luke would probably harbor his father in the last place people would expect. Tatooine (painfully obvious, but this is Star Wars). Anakin would recuperate in Obi-Wan's old house. Overtime, his suit would change. Not that gaudy white re-paint of Vader's suit (from Infinities), but something simpler, with more functionality. Gone would be the dramatic voice modulator and loud auto-breather, replaced by something quieter. A simple faceplate without anything too obvious. He'd probably heal his Kyber crystal, much like Ahsoka did. And, much like his former Padawan, he wouldn't be a Jedi.
Luke would keep this secret from everyone, but at some point Leia would find out, because she has the Skywalker spidey-sense. Luke and Anakin would have to do some HEFTY explaining, probably with R2 &amp; 3P0's assistance. Anakin Skywalker would have to go into deep exile. Leia wouldn't want him ANYWHERE near her or any children she might have. 

In exile, Anakin becomes a ghost of justice. Entire slave rings would disappear. Tatooine would become a safe haven for freed slaves. A white lightsaber would soon be synonymous with freedom. Ahsoka would eventually find her former master and possibly assist him. Imperial holdouts would dissappear. There wouldn't be a Battle for Jakku because Rax wouldn't survive long enough to initiate it. Sloan might survive, but she'd be haunted by the Ghost of Vader. The Outer Rim would be safer. Sightings of a mysterious cloaked figure would be reported annually on Naboo, near the crypt of Senator Amidala. 

Fast Forward

The New Republic is slightly less corrupt. While similar to Bloodlines, Anakin's secret war on crime would reduce the severity of said corruption. 

Ben Solo might have walked a similar path, but he would have sought his grandfather out against his mother's wishes, and Anakin would have taught his grandson about the dangers of the Dark Side. The Knights of Ren wouldn't be active because Anakin would 10/10 hunted them down.

The First Order wouldn't exist. Anakin knew the location of Exogol. There wouldnt be the wild goose chase of Luke and Lando going after Ochi of Bestoon. One of two things would have happened: Either a small strike team of Jedi and Anakin would defeat the Emperor, OR the New Republic would invade Exogol. The Xystons wouldn't be finished in time.

Anakin would probably die defeating the reborn Palps, saving the galaxy from the return of the Sith.
He'd be entombed on Naboo beside Padme, redeemed.",StarWars,What if Anakin Survived Endor?
1655748249,"Forgive me if this is a long post, I just have a whole bunch of problems with the PT.

Also I was born after the release of the PT, so really if I were to be nostalgic for any trilogy it would be the sequels.

I have seen many people arguing that the prequel trilogy was the best trilogy, and I feel like it's the opposite, I feel like it was the worst. The sequels are close but don't quite hit that low the prequels did. Now before I go into a massive tirade about all the flaws this trilogy has, I am first going to go over the positives, and what I liked, so I don't seem completely negative.

The effects were good, especially by 1999 standards, Revenge Of The Sith's effects were brilliant in most cases, what particularly comes to mind is the detail in the shot where we have a closeup on Grevious's face which looked insanely amazing.

Of course as always, John Williams's score was amazing. Not much to say about that, it's the one thing that never even dipped in quality through all the trilogies.

Darth Maul was a bit underused, but quickly became one of my favorites when I watched The Clone Wars. But that duel in The Phantom Menace was insane, choreography kind of dipped by ROTS, as it looked more like dancing rather than proper dueling, but still exciting.

Ewan McGregor was perfect casting for a younger Obi-Wan and his acting was the best of the entire trilogy. He put emotion into his lines and did the best with what he had.

Of course, Ian McDiarmid was great.

The plot was great, I loved the idea of seeing a trilogy where we see why Vader fell and how Palpatine manipulated the Republic to take it over and form the Empire.

But after all that, you think I would support this trilogy, but now we get into why I feel like this was the worst trilogy.

Lets start with episode 1: Politics isn't the problem, it's how it's handled. Star Wars has always been political, I mean Wars is in the title, but the politics is just boring. There is a way to make politics exciting, but this trilogy did none of that. The plot of this trilogy is that The Republic has introduced taxations on the previously tax-free trade routes, which pisses off the Trade Federation, a corporatist organization, who in response, basically holds Naboo hostage by blockading them. Firstly, why target Naboo specifically? there are plenty other planets who probably voted for that bill that they could attack, so why Naboo? Yes I do know that Palpatine had a role in it, but if they wanted to make it look like this wasn't all pre-planned, why do that specifically? Secondly, they don't explore why the Republic spent so long without taxing them only to just now make that choice, I know it's expanded on in comics where it has something to do with pirates, but if you rely on external material to explain what should be important plot stuff, you're doing something wrong. Thirdly, taxes. I mean, it's taxes. Next, beyond the politics, is cut Jar Jar Binks, the only role he plays is helping them find the Gungans, but that can be easily fixed. and in Attack Of The Clones, just have other Naboo representative vote to give Palpatine more power. Plus why would they give this dumbass a role in Galactic politics? It's insulting to Naboo, and everyone with more than 2 brain cells.

My proposition to fix some of the issues (considering how this isn't a 3 hour dissection of every flaw this trilogy has, this isn't a perfect rewrite idea), is what if The Trade Federation is a group promising military defense and extra representation in the Senate if they allow them to use their planet as a trade and refueling spot, however when one planet (not a member of the Republic which is why they didn't retaliate) refuses to join, the Federation launches their invasion, conquering the planet and forcing them in, Naboo is disgusted and votes to secede but due to their position (close to a very rich planet), the Federation can't afford to lose them and sends a blockade, threatening invasion if they don't rejoin. This gives a reason why they would blockade Naboo of all planets, and is also far more interesting than tax disputes. As for the Jedi, what if they were sent to start secret negotiations with the Gungans to form a military alliance with the people of Naboo due to their knowledge that Naboo won't rejoin the Federation which will force them to launch their invasion. If the conflict lasts long enough, it could start a war. This way we can cut Jar Jar out of the script entirely without losing anything plot-wise. 

Also, forgot to mention the prophecy. This mythical prophecy is basically the only reason Anakin is recruited as a Jedi. Lucas says his intention for this prophecy which is to ""balance the force"" is to see the eradication of the Sith and the dark side. This poses a huge problem, why do the Jedi give a shit about this prophecy when they thought the Sith were already extinct in the first place? They would have thought the force had already been balanced, because they had no idea that Sidious, Maul, or Plagueis existed. My personal interpretation is that balancing the force requires a balance of light and dark, if light has no darkness to counter it, then it's just blinding. The Jedi were so engrossed into the light, they would have been blinded by it. By balancing the light and the dark, not only would the Jedi understand the abilities of the Sith more, giving them a combat advantage, they also wouldn't be blinded by this idea that only the light should exist, giving a more mature twist to the story, as it's no longer about just plain old good vs evil. Overall, 3.5/10

Now on to Episode 2: Holy shit what is this writing?!? I think by this point I have talked about politics enough, so I'll give you the cliff notes version of that for this movie. Basically some Jedi thought that war would start soon, but his beliefs were rejected by the Jedi council, so he secretly went to the cloners on Kamino to commission the construction of a clone army, based on Jango Fett. Ok so first, I imagine requesting a clone army comprised of billions would be extremely expensive, no? Wouldn't at least someone in the financial bureau of the Republic notice a suspicious amount of money being drained anonymously? How would it take like 10 years to discover it? Also, how would he have the authority to just request a clone army for the Republic without any sort of verification that the Republic had authorized him to do this? so if I wanted to (if I lived in the Star Wars universe) could I just walk up and request they make a billion clone soldiers of me for whatever government rules the majority at the time? Also more boring politics where various systems want to secede because only now do they realize the Senate is a corrupt, bureaucratic, mess of a system? How did they not realize this sooner? Any way, on from the politics, to the writing.

I feel this film suffers the most from flawed writing. Things just kind of happen because the plot needs them to, and how the hell did Padme fall for Anakin when he admits to slaughtering an entire village of Tusken Raiders? The romance in this film is as bad as Twilight. 'I want to kill you so bad"" ""But I love you"". Ok maybe not that bad, but it's a close 2nd. I get why Anakin is immature in this movie, but could it be balanced out with us seeing some of his bottled up rage and anger? I almost couldn't believe this was the same character who slaughtered rebels in a hallway in spectacularly brutal fashions, the same guy who choked an officer to death for failing to capture some rebels, the same guy who chopped his own son's hand off so he could fuel his pain and rage, forcing him to join him. What if someone was there to stop Anakin from murdering the Tuskens so it would have him bottle up his anger, so when the emperor came to him in ROTS, it would give him the means to unleash that bottled up anger. Also, a benefit of having a more realistic relationship, is that we would understand why he goes to such extreme measures to save it. Also minor nitpick, when I rewatched this movie, I noticed they eat fruit with silverware. Who does that? Not even oligarchs do that, that's just a waste of silverware. This one was like a 2/10 for me.

Now for what I think most of you have been waiting for Episode 3: The film loaded with minor conveniences but still being a decent movie built on a god awful first two films. This movie was okay. Most of this isn't going to be the typical long connected arguments I had before, but rather minor disconnected things that made the viewing experience worse for me. Obi-wan talks about the times Anakin has rescued him, but all of it is stuff we haven't seen, which I find kind of strange. When Anakin visits Padme, they say there were rumors he'd been killed, which means he was probably away for a while, but Padme is recently pregnant, sooooooo? I wonder what that implies? More examples of bad writing: ""You're so beautiful"" ""Only because I'm so in love"" ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you"" What the hell? Has George Lucas ever been in an actual genuine relationship? Because this is clearly bullshit. Then we move on past a few scenes to Obi-Wan talking about events that we don't know about. A few scenes later after Anakin has been assigned to spy on Palpatine, we see clearly that he distrusts the council, and is beginning to believe they may be on the wrong side, but when Padme says it out loud, he is very pro-Jedi which is weird, considering how the next scene, he becomes kind of anti-Jedi.

So now we move on to the infamous Darth Plagueis scene, or as my mom calls it ""the slow head turns scene"". Judging by the fact that Palpatine calls Plagueis's death a tragedy, and then says he had taught his apprentice everything he knew, which just so happens to be force-healing. Just the thing Anakin needs about now. Basically at this scene any person who somehow hasn't caught on yet will know Palpatine is a Sith lord, so how has Anakin not yet? By the time he officially reveals he is a Sith, Anakin reports him to the Jedi, so we know he isn't a Sith sympathizer yet. After this, Anakin is pissed at Obi-Wan because the council chose him to lead the campaign to capture General Grievous on Utapau, despite it not being Obi-Wan's choice. Why not be mad at the council memebrs who called him inexperienced and then appointed Obi-wan, it's not like he appointed himself, then it would be somewhat reasonable to be mad at him. Also how did general Grievous not hear that varactyl that Obi-Wan was riding? It was pretty loud I'm sure he would hear it. Now we get to Anakin turning to the dark side. I don't give a shit. I don't feel any emotional connection to Anakin so I don't care when he falls, in fact, I'm glad, because Darth Vader is probably my all time favorite villain.

Then on to Order 66. Prior to Clone Wars, I felt no emotion when this scene played. We had no established relationship between the clones and the Jedi, and so we had no reason to feel sad. In the Clone wars however, they took a relatively mediocre and emotionless scene, and turned it into a genuine masterpiece. Now we get to the scene where Obi-Wan tells Padme that Anakin killed younglings, and she doesn't believe it, but she knows he killed kids before, and she was fine with it then, why not now? Maybe because before they were Tusken Raiders and not humans. Also Vader and Obi-Wan's duel feels more choreographed than for example, Qui Gon and Obi-Wan's duel with Maul. It feels more like a dance.

Lastly, the scene where Anakin is burned alive. I want to feel emotion here. I want to tear up and feel sadness and these practically brothers being driven apart and one hating the other. But I don't. I feel nothing. I actually feel glad because now we get to see Vader in suit. and it is one badass suit. Also something I noticed is that we never see Anakin train this entire trilogy, he's not a Mary Sue, at least not on Rey levels, but it's still weird.

Anyways, that took a while. About 4 hours to be exact. If you like the prequels, that's fine. I dislike the movies, not the people who watch them. it doesn't matter if a film is objectively bad, if you like it, you like it, and I doubt this post changes any of that. This was more a method for me to rant all my problems with these movies, rather than an argument to change your mind. Have a good day, or morning, or afternoon, or night. I don't know where you live. Or do I?",StarWars,I feel like the prequels are overpraised now
1655747674,"Jar Jar is not my favorite character by any means, but honestly, he's not that bad. Granted, my feelings changed with the release of The Clone Wars. I did not like the character very much in the prequels, but he was utilized a lot more intelligently in The Clone Wars and fit into that universe a lot more effortlessly when he shared the proverbial stage with other zany animated characters like Ziro the Hutt and that snake-looking dude in Maul's resurrection arc. (I cannot remember his name for the life of me, but y'all know who I'm talking about.)

The arc that finally converted me on Jar Jar Binks and made me like him retroactively was The Disappeared. His interactions with Mace Windu were genuinely amusing to watch and I felt like the idea that they could barely stand to be in each other's presence was *gently* riffing on the fan base's broad dislike of the character. I liked the idea of Jar Jar having a girlfriend as well and began to feel sorry for him because of the way he was treated and written off by everyone else in the story. I mean, the guy can't even catch a break in-universe. I don't know what it was about that arc that finally humanized Jar Jar Binks for me, but goddamn it, it worked. When I re-watch the prequels now, he doesn't bother me at all. Again, he's still not a favorite character of mine by any means, but I accept him as a part of that universe and no longer question his presence in the story.

This doesn't have anything to do with the whole Darth Jar Jar thing. I am well aware of the DJJ ""theory"" and realize that it is clearly just a meme that got out of control, which is still fun to talk about as a speculative thing, but I am honestly just referring to the character of Jar Jar Binks as he is depicted in actual canon material.

1655740871,"For starters, I just want to say I in no way am trying to take away from what any of you like or find fun. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why I‚Äôm even making this. Maybe just to see if anybody agrees with me lol. It really seems like nobody does. I only ever hear positive things about the show. 

One reason I think I don‚Äôt enjoy my time watching it is I didn‚Äôt grow up with it. Not to say cartoons can‚Äôt be enjoyed by adults, because they can, but I believe it‚Äôs easier to enjoy them as an adult when you grew up on them. Another reason is the nature of how cartoons progress. For ever 10 episodes, the plot moves an inch. Which makes total sense because it was a Saturday morning cartoon, but again, it‚Äôs a bad introduction to it. I find myself growing increasingly bored as I watch it. When I hear others mention they are having trouble getting through the filler of it all, it‚Äôs often advised ‚Äúoh just wait until season 3, it really picks up!‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to have to watch half a show to get to the good stuff. 

The show also directly contradicts some of the lore which I‚Äôve grown to appreciate. As I haven‚Äôt watched the whole show, I can only go off what I‚Äôve been told, but from my understanding things happen like Maul survives his fight with Obi Wan and Qui Gon. Also Dooku and Anakin apparently meet up and fight several times. Things which just don‚Äôt make sense to me. I can understand retconning to a degree, but those are over the line in my opinion. 

Here‚Äôs the big killer though. Beyond not being able to get into a cartoon I have no nostalgia for. Beyond the fights with Dooku and the miraculous survival of somebody being cut in half and dropped thousands
of feet down a shaft. The big killer of the whole thing for me is Ashoka. And not necessarily her character, although she is pretty annoying, but the fact she exists at all. Anakin given a Padawan? Are you kidding me? Half the council didn‚Äôt trust him, let alone like him. This is by far the most unrealistic part of it all for me. It makes me ignore anything that came from the show. 

Again, I really want to push that I in no way am trying to make anybody feel like they shouldn‚Äôt enjoy it. If you love it, I love that you love it. I‚Äôm just shedding some of what I feel about it.

So Anakin Skywalker is basically as bad as a school shooter. How does someone like that get redeemed when he throws his boss down an elevator shaft? Vader was dying anyway.

1655704328,"So just had a thought, maybe someone else has had it before. I dunno. Also my Star Wars knowledge is essentially limited to the movies and live action TV shows. Any way....

So there's that old joke about storm troopers having terrible aim. But why did they become bad shots? These guys had no problem slaughtering almost every Jedi, many of whom were quite powerful, and they never seemed to have had any problems with shooting the average peasant or rebel either. Quite clearly they are, or were quite effective soldiers. 

Heck they're such good shots even jedi have to deflect them.

Which brings us to Obi-Wan and his line to Vader. 

&gt; **If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine** 

This has lead to many people over the years asking 'What did he mean by that?' after all he just turned into a ghost who seemed to do nothing but talk.

But we also see Yoda and redeemed Vader also became ghosts in ROTJ and later films. So it makes sense all the slaughtered Jedi were also running around as 'force ghosts' or maybe that should be 'force poltergeists'.

Is it all those force ghosts making them bad shots? Is this what Obi-Wan meant? That it would grant him, and all the other dead force users the ability to be able to go any where any time and get all 'poltergeisty' when needed as they're now quite literally part of a universe spanning supernatural power.

So while these 'ghosts' cannot cut anyone down with a light saber any more, they can manipulate the physical world still on some level as it seems Storm Troopers only get bad aim when a character relevant to the 'light sides' goal of restoring balance is involved.

Luke had all but 5 seconds of jedi training before Obi-Wan kicked it. And he clearly sucked at it during the helmeted Light Saber training bit and he couldn't really do anything 'Jedi' aside from talking to ghosts before meeting Yoda. 

But he was able to 'use the force' and guide a missile down a small hole. Maybe 'Use the force Luke', the force being dead Jedi meant he allowed himself to be used as a conduit for the Jedi to channel their power through and it was actually Obi and friends who put the missile where it needed to be. After all, looking at all the other, I imagine experienced, rebel X-wing pilots that got slaughtered pretty easily. So again Storm Troopers are not bad shots, and Vader was meant to be some Top Gun Maverick of his universe and even he couldn't hit Luke's ship that was flying in a straight line down a walled trench. pretty much a fish in a barrel. Luke who until like a day or two ago had zero Fighter pilot experience. Heck had this backwater farm boy even flown a real ship before then?

Even when he first gets to Dagobah, he seems to have zero 'force' anything aside from seeing and talking to dead people. He cannot even lift a small rock with the power. Only explanation I can think of is Obi-Wan and friends watching his back until Luke gits gud.

All the movies I feel reinforce this. As long as you're part of the light sides plan you are protected.

Would also explain how Chewbacca made it through the entire franchise as he's been there from the beginning. He's quite clearly not just some smuggler, but a battle hardened war vet. I mean how many battles and encounters with the Empire did he have before he met Han and afterwards?

Maybe he quite literally had a guardian angel Mace Windu or two on his shoulder? Like ghostie Obi-Wan seemed to be always following Luke around.

Give us the siths vs the Jedi  a old republic movie with serious violence.   I‚Äôve seen enough cute women running around and wild plot stuff. We got a female Jedi  I watched the first one. It was ok for kids in my opinion. 

Now since all the fans who watched the prequels and grew up on the clone wars are all older can we get a real war movie?
