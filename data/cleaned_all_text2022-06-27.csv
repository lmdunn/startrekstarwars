I’m also curious as to whether or not the crew is still on their five-year mission, and what justification would be used to bring them back into space. Do we get retired Admiral Kirk? Sulu on the Excelsior? It’ll have been fifteen years since the original film by the time this movie comes out. What are your pitches for Star Trek Kelvin 4?"

At almost every scene and decision being made involving the Borg, I found myself yelling at the TV, ""Don't do that, dammit!  You have no idea what you're f*cking with!""  

I had forgotten about the TNG movie that had the Borg travelling back in time to mess up First Contact.  I like how this episode tied into it when Capt. Archer was researching an old speech of Zephram Cochrane, referencing that incident. 

I've stated a few times when posting about Enterprise how I never watched it before until earlier this year.  This series is excellent and I'm loving it so far. Enterprise S2 E23 Regeneration"

startrek,"Strange New Worlds has felt like a breath of fresh air to a lot of people. It captures everything that makes Star Trek unique while still managing to have its own voice with creative new concepts. But it also has done well at coming back to established lore to add more context to elements of Trek that have only been briefly touched on.

The Gorn comes to mind, as does Sybok (though we will need to see what they do with him).

But what other neglected parts of canon would you like to see get more attention?

I would love to see where Captain Garth is at. There's a huge gap between the Battle of Axanar in 2251 and TOS 'Whom Gods Destroy' in 2268 that SNW is right in the middle of. What deep cuts from Trek lore would you like to see in SNW? [Spoilers for all things SNW]"

It's black with ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" embroidered on the back and left breast, and has C'Plus embroidered on one shoulder. He doesn't use Reddit but was wondering if anyone knew anything about them, like when they were produced or even where this guy might've gotten one, so I'm posting this for him! I can provide pictures if they're wanted. If anyone knows anything, I would love to know! Thank you so much! DS9 Jacket"
startrek,"I trimmed just the effect out to show it to you guys here, so you don't have to watch the whole video, since it doesn't all have to do with Star Trek. What do you think for a first try?

startrek,So there’s no economic system anymore on earth…what does everyone else that is not in starfleet do back on earth? Soooo what about everybody else?
startrek,"Gotta say that it made me really uncomfortable seeing Kirk get all rapey with yeoman Rand. I don't want to get all woke about this and I understand that the episode is quite intelligently written. It's actually quite deep in it's examination of the male psyche with regards to sexual,violent,and compassionate,human behaviour. However,the very end of the episode with Rand being all timid and and apologetic with Kirk after what happened and especially that creepy smile from Spock didn't sit right with me. Just watched 'the enemy within '"

startrek,"If you had to rename the unimaginatively titled Star Trek: The Motion Picture what would it be?

startrek,So I just started watching Strange New Worlds? Is it me or is the Captains Quarters HUGE on this show? When we saw Picard’s quarters in TNG it was never this large. How is it as the ships of the Federation get more advanced they seem to get more utilitarian? What are peoples thought? HUGE Captains Quarters?!?
startrek,"One of the things I always thought was nice about star trek, is how positive it was, in an era of apocalyptic and all around bad world view that was common with syfy shows/movies, we had got a world where the entire planet was at peace. cause we got over all of our problems.I've heard that some just write it off as liberal nonsense or whatever, but I just thought it was...nice. a more positive science fiction series"
startrek,"I am trying to translate the moive of PC game Star Trek: Klingon Academy. There is a creature appear Several times. It is called something like ""corling"" or ""Korling"" by klingon. I'm not sure what it is because there are no subtitles. I didn't find any resemble noun in memory alpha or beta. Can anyone tell me anything about it? Even an exact name will do. Context is a toothless korling or a stuck korling.Thank you very much for your help. Looking for a creature from star trek game, might be a klingon creature."
startrek,The image is at 0:58 in the video. A shot of the Gorn in the trailer???
startrek,"lol WTF!? This bizarre line from Kirk just came out of nowhere with no evidence or previously seen footage to back it up, at the beginning of ""Wolf in the Fold"".

startrek,"I’d like to start watching Star Trek, but don’t know where to jump in. Should I start all the way at the beginning? Watch one of the newer series first and then work my way back? 

Probably overthinking this, but if you have a suggestion I’m open :) Where should I start?"
startrek,"Hi Trekkie, so I’ve been rewatching the movie from Star Trek and wondering a few “what if’s”. This one is the one I want to ask the most. 

If for some reason, the crew was able to evacuate and separate the saucer section from the warp section and go full impulse well before the warp core exploded, once being met by other ships or somehow making it back to earth solely on impulse; would the Enterprise D have been rebuilt and repaired, or scrapped completely with the loss of the other half of the ship and be subsequently replaced by the Enterprise E?

Thanks If the saucer section of the Enterprise D was able to escape the blast of the warp core and not lose control in ST Generations, would the Enterprise D have been rebuilt, or scrapped still for the Enterprise E?"

startrek,"I suspect that Patrick Stewart as Jean Luc Picard would be considered, by most Trek fans, to be the best main-cast actor on Star Trek: The Next Generation. So who would you consider to be the second-best? Jonathan Frakes as Riker? Brent Spiner as Data? LeVar Burton as Geordie La Forge? Someone else? Remember that we're talking about acting skills, not character likeability. Who was the second-best actor from the TNG main cast? Second-best actor from the TNG series main cast."
startrek,"This may be a silly question, but why are there no seat belts on the enterprise in the Original Series? (I haven't paid close attention to if the other ships in the other series have seat belts. Please let me know if they do). I laugh every time the crew falls over so dramatically. Lol. No Seat Belts On The Enterprise"
startrek,"“Thank you,” not because SNW feels like ‘classic’ Trek. Instead, “thank you” for such a fantastic show of top quality writing, directing, production, casting and acting. I need to say, to the creative minds and to the cast of SNW, “THANK YOU.”"
startrek,"Just wanted to mention that Babs Olusanmokun has done such a great job as Doctor M'Benga thus far. In ""The Elysian Kingdom"" he carried the episode as the leading man and his acting at the end made me tear up a bit. He didn't say much, but the emotions he conveyed with his face and eyes and body language seemed so real.

While I didn't get quite as emotional as I did with ""The Visitor"" or ""Inner Light,"" I think this episode could end up being mentioned alongside those tearjerkers in the future. I think the emotional catharsis is still there, but since the majority of the episode is light-hearted and comedic we have a bit of an emotional cushion if you will (compared to watching Jake try to save Benjamin and ruin his own life for 50+ years.) What a fantastic episode.

Also, honorable mention to the fly-fishing scene. Everyone else on the station was running around trying to solve their problems and here's Doctor M'Benga just enjoying the moment and not saying a single word. Plus he wore his silly hat.

I also hope that he has a bit part in Dune: Part 2 because I'd like to see him play Jamis again. Babs Olusanmokun (Doctor M'Benga) is fantastic in SNW"
startrek,"Just watched The Elysian Kingdom, and man, what a run this has had so far. Just quality episode after quality episode.  It feels like it improves every week. This just has the feel of Trek that I loved (TNG era), but still with a modern sensibility without succumbing to the myriad pitfalls of other new Trek (no need to re-list them here, we all know the issues). 

I'm enjoying it SO MUCH. Great characters I already connect with, good writing and lovely done one stories. I don't know who the driving force was behind the feel and direction of the show, but it's pitch perfect for us old bastards. Here's hoping we get a full 5-7 seasons. SNW has rekindled my love for Trek!"
startrek,"On star trek alpha fandom it says capt. Archer is alive in 2233. in prime timeline or 2258 in kelvin timeline.So it would mean that he is 121 in prime timeline,while he is 146 in kelvin timeline.How is that possible? Jonathan Archer"
startrek,"At least, for me. Getting into DS9 as they had recently added Worf. Loved the Basics cliffhanger for Voyager. Gave us the 30th anniversary episodes in ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" and ""Flashback"". And I watched First Contact in theatres 5 times. I have been a Trekkie since 1991, and I cannot remember a more exciting year for the fandom. 1996 was the most exciting year to be a Trek fan!"
startrek,"I only ask because wouldn't two different people have different ideas as to what's logical in some scenarios? I honestly feel like some scenarios could be sorted through multiple conclusions rather than just one.

startrek,"Let's say K'Ehleyr was close to dying at the end of the episode 'Reunion"" but Doctor Crusher was able to save her. Here's how I think the new au would play out:

\-K'Ehleyr and Worf get married since Worf does not want to lose her and K'Ehleyr knows about Worf's discommendation and accepts/thinks Worf is a great man for protecting the Klingon empire, etc. 

\-Worf's relationship with his son Alexander improves a lot better since K'Ehleyr is there

\-K'Ehleyr, while still an ambassador, lives on the Enterprise full time with Worf and her son

\-Worf does goes to serve for the Klingon Empire during two parter Redemption and K'Ehleyr knows Worf needs to do this for their people, tells K'Ehleyr she needs to stay behind with Alexander on the Enterprise. Comes back at the end of the two parter and the family is reunited, etc. Worf resumes his duties as chief of security.

\-K'Ehleyr transfers to DS9 with Alexander and Worf in 2372

&amp;#x200B;

There's some of the things on the top of my head that could happen if K'Ehleyr had lived. If K'Ehleyr had lived"
startrek,Am I the only one that can't stand this new series? Did they hire a bunch of new writers? And what's up with the cast good setup they just did them so wrong and step away from the core values of what star trek is I feel like!  Being a life long trek fan I'm upset the way the new Era of star trek is going this whole series just annoys me well if your just getting Into star trek I guess it's good for you guys..... just my opinion Star trek strange new worlds
startrek,"I was in late season 6 when the Netflix banner ""Last day to watch: July 1st"" popped up (I'm in the US). I've been racing against the clock to get through everything ahead of the deadline.

It's really sad to me, because DS9 is honestly my favorite Star Trek series so far. I started with TOS, then TNG, now DS9, and I just love the darker, non-utopian tone, the political intrigue, and the large cast of supporting characters that keep coming back, all making the world that much richer.

I've rushed through &gt;!Jadzia's death,  which I already had spoiled and was super sad!&lt;, and have made my way through S7E17. Now I see ahead of me an 8-part series of episodes (!!!) and then a double length finale. So it feels like I'm on the tipping point of the end of this series, and it's really sad. I feel like I haven't had enough time with newer characters (why couldn't there be more episodes with Vic??) and the older ones still have so much left to give. I don't see how the rest of the loose ends with the &gt;!Dominion, the pact with the Romulans, the Founders' disease, the wormhole aliens and pah wraiths, Section 31!&lt;, and everything else can get resolved in this amount of time.

I know this is all normal series-end melancholy, but I just wanted to share the feeling and express my hope that other series will match up to DS9.

(And yeah, I've started buying blurays and DVDs of the shows. Not going to rely on some stupid streaming platform if I want to rewatch things in the future. And I'd love to avoid paramount plus for the new stuff, even though it's probably impossible.) Racing against the Netflix clock with DS9"

startrek,AS TO WHY THIS IS IN ALL CAPS IS BECAUSE I HAD TO DELETE MY LAST POST WITH THE SAME QUESTION BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS WAS SPOILIMG THIS WEEKS EPISODE WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN YET IM ASKING ABOUT LAST WEEKS EPISODE. As a parent I personally would be freaking out at the thought of my daughter being killed if the Enterprise was sold for scrap by the pirates or sold to the Klingons and torn apart to copy the tech. So how can Doc M'Benga be so collected knowing she could die? DO NOT COMMENT ABOUT THIS WEEKS EPISODE OR ACCUSE ME OF SPOILERS FOR AN EPISODE THAT AIRED LAST WEEK!!!!!!!!!! WHEN CAPTAIN ANGEL STEALS THE ENTERPRISE WHY IS DR. M'BENGA SO UNCONCERNED THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS STOLEN WITH IT?
startrek,"So I'm doing a TOS marathon with my friends before The Wrath of Khan comes out in theatres for the 40th anniversary. A few of them had never seen any Star Trek so I got a list of episodes that are must sees including the best episodes, the funniest episodes, the historically important episodes and the worst episodes. But I'm stumped on what episode to end on. Can you guys think of any episode that can serve as a sort of unoffical end to the original series? Something that might wrap up or otherwise encapsulate what Star Trek was all about? Also who's all going to see Wrath of Khan this September? Best Star Trek TOS episode to end on?"
startrek,"Quick primer: Star Trek Adventures is a tabletop RPG published the Modiphius Entertainment. Instead of Dungeons &amp; Dragons it's Enterprises &amp; Entities.

The game's been in publication since 2017, and for a themed RPG, I honestly believe it's one of the best I've every played. However, when the game entered publication the license only covered the television series from TOS to ENT; no movies, no Kelvin stuff, and no new Trek. They've since renegotiated, and now are able to produce material for Disco and PIC as well.

So far that's meant three packs of official character sheets for the first three seasons of Disco, and now this campaign guide covering the first two seasons, which became available in PDF last week, and I am just reading now for the first time. So, much like with the [Shackleton Expanse Campaign Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/pqcvls/first_impressions_of_the_star_trek_adventures/) when that came out, I'm just going to flip around the book and see what's interesting.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Player Options**

Even thought I'm almost always the gamemaster, I do check out player options first any time a get a new book.

There's a few new species options here, which is always cool.

 • Barzan: It's always interesting when we get a new player species that has had very little on screen representation, because it's just the writers cobbling together ideas from hints and beta canon.

The Barzan have access to an talent that lets them potentially substitute a piece of gear for one they don't have access to, and it makes me wonder if I'm perhaps to lenient in my games where I allow the players to basically do that anyways with a half convincing argument.

 • Kelpien: I made a homebrew Kelpien species back during Disco season one, and updated them for season two, so having an official version is nice. I will admit that this one is a bit more streamlined then my own. Though I do think the Threat Ganglia talent should be required as opposed to just optional, and would probably house rule it as such.

 • Osnullus: Another species where all the information is entirely made up seeing as we know nothing about them other than the fact that they occasionally show up in the background aboard Discovery.

Of their two optional talents, I really like the one that allows them to get automatic re-rolls in a single discipline; that's really strong. The other option is to make it difficult to be caught in a lie because their faces are unreadable, which isn't particularly exciting, and is probably something I would argue could be covered by their trait.

 • Xahean: Another species I've written a homebrew version of, and I like mine better. Though other than a few minor differences they're pretty similar, so this once certainly isn't bad.

I'm not sure the Camouflage Field talent accurately represents what we see Po do in 'The Runaway', but I suppose there are game balance elements to consider.

 • Saurian: I don't have much to comment on. The seem perfectly fine, and it's nice to have a species introduced in TMP added to the game.

 • Cybernetically Enhanced: Not technically a species in and of itself, but a template that gets combined with another species, like mixed species characters, or the Liberated Borg added in earlier supplements.

The write-up makes me assume Airiam was the inspiration for the template, but the character in the artwork looks more like Detmer's situation, but the rules for a character like Detmer already exist in the core rulebook. The stat blocks from the Disco character packs confirms that Airiam is what they had in mind.

Anyways, the Synthetic Physiology talent doesn't seem particularly interesting, but I really like the Analytical Recall talent, which allows the character to just ask the GM questions and get answers without having to spend the resources normally used for that.

 • There is a brief sidebar on playing Ba'ul characters in a later chapter, but they don't get a full write-up.

 • Terran characters also get a sidebar in the Terran Empire chapter, but it essentially boils down to how not every Terran is evil.

&amp;nbsp;  
There are rules here for Klingon characters to undergo the procedure that Ash Tyler and Arne Darvin did. I can't remember off hand if these rules are in the Klingon core rulebook as well, but even if they are it makes sense to have them here.

&amp;nbsp;
There's some cool new gear options. Specifically the device that Burnham and Tyler use to mask their Human life signs when they're aboard the Ship of the Dead, Georgiou's special S31 gear when she's on Qo'noS in season two, and some Terran Empire specific gear. There's also Reno's drones from the Hiawatha.

The tactical vests seem kind of expensive considering how ubiquitous they are on away missions. I think I would have preferred something less useful, but also less resource intensive. (Like the homebrew version I made)

&amp;nbsp;  
**SHIPS!**

So, my biggest frustration with Disco is how the ships are supposed to be so much larger than previous iterations of Trek, and how do you reconcile that? The STA answer seems to be to just ignore it.

For anyone unfamiliar with STA, all starships have a stat called Scale, which is not solely about how large the ship is, but that's certainly a factor. Shuttles and runabouts are scale 1 and 2 respectively, and once you get up to the Defiant or Nova-class ships you're at scale 3. Based on their relative size, you would expect the smallest Disco starships to be scale 4, with the Discovery itself being scale 6. Smartly I think, the writers of the book have all the Starfleet ships at scale 3 or 4, which keeps them in line with other ships specific to that era, and saves me a lot of homebrew edits.

Anyways, it looks like all the Starfleet ships introduced in the first two seasons of the show are here, including the Hiawatha-class, and the various Section 31/Starfleet Intelligence ships from season two.

Regarding the Crossfield-class, the book claims there were only ever three ships of the class commissioned, the Discovery, the Glenn, and the Crossfield, and suggests that if GMs/players wanted to use the Crossfield that it not include the spore drive. Which makes sense considering we know the Glenn and the Discovery were the two ships the drive was being tested on. There are rules for using the spore drive though, in an earlier chapter discussing integrating the mycellial network into a game.

The section in Klingon ships includes some lore about how most of the ship designs are actually salvaged Hur'q vessels repurposed after the Klingons cast the Hur'q off Qo'noS. I suppose that's as good an explanation as any for why the Disco Klingon ships look so different from what we're familiar with, though personally I wasn't too concerned about it. Strangely enough, the book implies the Klingon invisibility screens were also based on reverse engineered Hur'q technology at one point, but in another says they were acquired from the Romulans. Seems like an editor should have caught that discrepancy.

Like the Starfleet ships, the Klingon ships have been reigned in. The Ship of the Dead is scale 6, and there are a couple scale fives, but the rest are all 3 or 4. I actually think the Qugh-class destroyer should be scale 5 based on its relative size, but for some reason it's listed as a 3. I assume they were cut for space, but the Veqlargh and Qow-class spaceframes were not included.

We also get stats for the Ba'ul fighters, and the Terran Empire's throneship, the Charon.

No stats for the Ba'ul patrol ships, the Class C shuttlecraft, the Starfleet landers, the Starfleet tactical flyers, the Vulcan cruiser, or the Klingon raiders.

I do like the option of including DOTs as a starship talent. The other starship talent that caught my eye is Specialized Crew, and that's because there doesn't seem to be any benefit to it, so I don't know why anyone would choose waste one of the very limited available slots on it.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Gamemaster Specific Stuff**

As always, there is a lot of lore for gamemasters to build their campaigns around, most of it surrounding the Federation-Klingon War, and the ""Red Angel Crisis"". There's lots of information about Klingon Houses, which would be very useful for a Klingon campaign set during this time, or for a Federation campaign that was getting in deep with the Federation-Klingon War.

The suggestions for the Red Angel Crisis seem less useful. Most of it seems like it would be stepping on the Discovery's toes, so to speak, and personally I've never really wanted to run or play in a game that was basically just retreading an established story.

There's a whole chapter on the Terran Empire.

Other information includes what's going on with the Romulan Star Empire, as well as the Cardassians, the Tholians, Orions, and some others.

&amp;nbsp;  
Chapter 8 is Allies and Adversaries; stats for major and minor NPCs, and it's strange to see who they choose. Admiral Cornwell, Sarek, Amanda, and Leland for the Federation; Control and its minions; T'Kuvma, Kol, and Tanavik on the Klingon side of things; Gabrielle Burnham, Mudd along with Mudd's android duplicates from 'The Escape Artist', Po, Saru's sister Siranna, then the Ba'ul, and the Pahvans round things out.

No L'Rell, and no Emperor Gerogiou, though both of them are available in the separate character packs Modiphius also published. I'm also surprised that jahSepp aren't included. Ujilli, Dennas, and Kol-Sha would be useful, as would admiral Terral.

There are stats for gromaganders and tardigrades, though the tardigrade seems relatively weak considering how dangerous it was on the show. Also, I kinda wish they'd went with the tie-in novel, *Dead Endless*' interpretation of the tardigrade as being a sentient, multi-dimensional being named Ephraim.

&amp;nbsp;  
Finally, there's a short pre-made campaign set ""during the darkest days of the Federation-Klingon war"" after the Discovery has disappeared to the Mirror Universe. I haven't looked at that much in depth, but I am intrigued.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Odds &amp; Ends**

One thing I want to call out is the book is a pleasure to look through. In their effort of capture the look of the source material, I find that some of the STA stuff can be hard on the eyes, specifically works set during the TOS era, or the Klingon specific supplements. This though is really easy to look at, even in PDF format.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Artwork**

STA books often have some really nice, fun art. Unfortunately that is one aspect of the Disco campaign book that is a bit lacking, comparatively. There's still some good stuff in here though, including a few bits I want to call out specifically.

Interior Front Cover - There is a two page map of the Federation Klingon border, which I believe is taken directly from the show. Nice to get a legible version of that.

pg. 45 - Image of the Battle of the Binary Stars. The artist for this one did a really nice job.

pg. 49 - Not my favourite bit of art in the book, but there are some Disco Klingons wielding slightly more TNG style bat'laths, as well as a Starfleet officer absolutely decking a Klingon.

pg. 205 - There's a nice render of the Enterprise. It's just against a black field, not doing anything, but man, I really do like the Disco/SNW iteration of the Constitution-class. First Impressions of the Star Trek Adventures: Discovery Campaign Guide"
startrek,So upon re watching Strange New Worlds season 1 episode 7 Dr. M'Benga seems to have absolutely no concern that Captain Angel has stolen the Enterprise with his daughter in the medical transporter buffer. As a parent myself I would have been absolutely frantic that my daughter is in the buffer of the stolen ship and if sold for scrap or any other thing she would be killed. So why then is he not the least bit concerned? Is it just me or is Dr. M'Benga strangely unconcerned that his daughter was stolen along with the Enterprise?

startrek,"My partner and I have been together two years. We have so much fun together, love the same shows, play video games together. But no matter what she can't seem to take Star Trek seriously. 

It sounds silly, but I do feel a bit heartbroken somehow. It's been a favorite show ever since I first watched TOS from VHS tapes at the library. Next Gen got me through high school, DS9 and Voyager through college. 

From Spock to Data, Kirk to Picard, Worf to Tuvok, all the characters are close to my heart and their stories helped me build the character of the person I am today. It's hard for me to know she looks at it the way she does. 

She basically feels that it isn't diverse and the storylines about women are dated and clearly written by men. I think they are both valid arguments in many ways... But it's also hard because she's only seen TOS and the first 4 seasons of Next Gen. And I think if she watched the later seasons and all series, she might appreciate it more?

But maybe that's just my own love talking haha I guess I'm just venting but I wonder if anyone else is dealing with these problems. I don't really know if there's a solution other than letting go of hopes she'll ever love the show. 

It's silly, but I hope maybe some of you understand on some level. Why does it hurt so much to know she doesn't like Star Trek?"

Are there any other ship models used in the shows that are in museums, studio tours, or collections that can be seen by the public? How many Star Trek studio ship models are shown in museums?"
startrek,"So I started watching the show, wanted to see all the fuzz is all about with Nurse Chapel and please you guys got to be kidding me?

Why is she everyone's favourite and not Laan or Uhura. why do people keep on saying how pretty she is, and not the other female characters.

 This is the subconscious racism  that POC fans talk about. How it is so  easy for the white blonde girl to be easily favoured. Why are mant fans so obsessed with Nurse Chapel calling her the breakout star. Nurse Chapel is the classic example of white privilege  and how the blonde white girl don't have to do much but fans will love them anyway. 

 I can't wait when  SNW begins to match up more with TOS and the Kelvin films. I hope Spock gets with Uhura later on on the show. As I preferred the dynamic more of Spock/Uhura in TOS episodes like Charlie X.

I think it is ironic about people saying how hot chapel is even though in TOS, Spock finds Uhura very beautiful. Cant remember him thinking the same about Chapel. 

***Spock to Uhura in TOS: ''Uhura whose name means freedom, she walks in beauty like the night''***

But back to Chapel, I am glad they are addressing her ties to Spock so early in the series, this means by season 3 or late season 2, Spock should be moving on to Uhura as his love interest. While Chapel should be with Roger Koby.

Dont get me wrong, I have nothing against Chapel personally and I was rooting for her in the beginning, but now I am rotting more for Uhura or Lann because I have seen the subconscious  racism that goes on in fandom, when it comes to the easy preference of the white blonde character. Nurse Chapel's character"
startrek,Does anyone else feel that a post Picard show is obviously imminent? I can’t imagine going to all of the trouble of creating a whole set for the Stargazer only to use it for about 20 minutes total. It may not necessarily be a Stargazer show as they could just slightly redesign the set to appear to be a different ship. I’m certainly hopeful! Post Picard Show

startrek,"I love all Star Trek, but when are they going to get serious and challenge DS9 as the best series? Don't get me wrong SNW is killing it for what it is.

startrek,"I feel like the Iconians should've gotten an arc, or been brought back for an episode or something. I personally think the Iconians would've been the perfect main antagonist for Voyager (I liked the Borg too), that Voyager finds out they're somehow alive and the Caretaker Array used Iconian technology or something like that because we know that the Iconians would have the means to get Voyager back to Earth, and we know that they were not a peaceful race, so it would've been a perfect match-up. I'm rambling a bit here, all I want to say is that Iconians should've been more than a dead race with some very dangerous technology (during the TNG Era). 

Disclaimer: I understand that the Iconians show up in Star Trek Online, but I'm mostly talking about expansion of their lore in TNG era Trek. The Iconians should've been expanded upon"
startrek,"Sisko tells the Klingon lawyer that he thinks Worf was ready to take command, is a good officer, and knew the Klingons. 

At the end of the episode, Worf explains why he should not have accepted the mission in which Sisko responds ""I'm glad you realize that. That was your first mistake"". 

This....doesn't.....make.....sense. 

So Sisko wants Worf to take command of the mission and tells the audience at the beginning, but then tells the audience at the end of the episode that Worf was wrong for taking the mission?

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of Ron Moore's better scripts in my opinion. Sisko's dialogue in the end contradicts what he said at the beginning of the episode.

The DS9 crew notices this also, but all that Worf says is that they (presumably Klingons) do not like to talk about this.

Logically, I'm sure it has something to do with the advances in makeup and the use of protheses in film and movie productions, but is there a canon explanation in the Star Trek universe to account for the dramatic change? What caused the Klingons' change of appearance between the 23rd and 24th century?"

startrek,"This might be an unpopular opinion (more so regarding the latter) but I have been loving the TNG movies lately.

First Contact is well liked by both fans and critics and even regarded by a lot of people as the best Trek movie ever. The dialogue and story are very strong which makes the movie highly entertaining. It's packed with action that feature the Borg (greatest Star Trek antagonist) and visual effects that surprisingly hold up. In my opinion, First Contact is not only one of the best Star Trek films but one of the best Sci-Fi movies.

Okay here comes the most controversial opinion...I love Insurrection. I know there is a ton of criticism of the plot and how it feels like an extended episode of TNG but it works so well. The humour and scenes on the Ba'ku planet make for a lighter watch compared to the dark tones in First Contact. The movie is a slow burn but I think it really picks up in the last 40 minutes and includes some fun action and battle scenes. The Son'a don't come close to Borgs in regards to being villains but I enjoyed them and Ru'afo as a ruthless leader.

Anyone else feel similar about these movies? First Contact &amp; Insurrection are my favourite Star Trek movies."
startrek,"This can include TNG if you'd like, but I can only think of one episode that may fit the criteria in TNG.

startrek,"Hello fellow Trekkies ;) Do you guys remember Deep Space Nine The Fallen from 2000? I had bought it shortly after playing Elite Force and its expansion pack, where you could explore nearly all of Voyager’s decks. Before buying DS9 The Fallen I remember seeing some screenshots that showcased some locations on DS9 that the developers had built – but for some reason than excluded from the final version of the game.

Does anyone have any insight or knows somebody who was involved in the production of this game? I would love to know what happened to these levels/maps or why they were excluded. It’s an unreal engine game – so I was able to look through all maps with the included level editor. The maps follow (like other unreal games at that time) a numerical order of = M01 (for mission 1) to M11 (= mission 11). Interestingly M02 as well as M08, M09 are missing. I guess I should have contacted the developers in 2000, when the games website was active but at that time I didn’t think of that option. ;-P

In the game you can visit ops, the promenade, computer core and some parts of the outer docking ring (ore processing). According to the screenshots I found they had also included parts of the habitat ring and even the runabout hangar. I would have loved to put all these maps together and create sometype of expansion pack like they did for Elite Force Voyager.

I included some screenshots of the locations they had removed from the game - in case somebody is curious:  https://imgur.com/qmVghUc Deep Space Nine - The Fallen"

startrek,"Captain Pike sat at a table, with a glass in hand.  Relaxing.  Across the table sat a Jex, elegant in a loose-fitting silken tunic and her own body’s soft fur.  She also held a glass, and daintily dipped her slender muzzle to lap from it.  Her enormous ears, fringed with feathers, swiveled lightly, always alert.

Pike said, “I can’t thank you enough for your help sorting out that temporal rift.  But, if what you’ve told us is all true. . .  I have some questions I’d love to ask about time travel.”

The Jex shrugged lightly and smiled.  “I don’t mind.  I’m sure you understand I’m not going to hand you the blueprints for a time machine.  But I don’t feel like that’s what you were going to ask about.”

Pike chuckled.  “Nothing like that.  It’s more of a personal matter, in fact.”  His face became more serious, and he leaned forward and confided, “I’ve been to Boreth.  I don’t know if you’ve heard of Boreth, but I had a vision of my future.  I saw a warp reactor accident on board a starship.  The radiation doesn’t kill me, but in some ways it’s worse.  I saw it leaving me severely disabled and disfigured.”

“How grim!” commented the Jex, coolly.  “Go on. . .”  Her ears showed he had her full attention.

Pike glanced down, clasped his hands together.  “The visions people have at Boreth, they always come true.  It’s like they’re written in stone.  But you. . .  Your people travel through time as casually as we fly through space.  Can you change the past and alter the future?  Avert the accident entirely?”

The Jex blinked and leaned back.  “Oh.  That is complicated, and your language is poorly suited to even discuss such matters.”

Pike pressed, “Then un-complicate it for me!  Yes or no, even?”

The Jex pulled her fluffy tail around into her lap and scratched thoughtfully with blunt claws.  She said, “Very well, I will try to explain.   Any civilization that discovers time travel experiences a moment of giddiness, exhilaration—along with terror.  This is the ultimate superpower, you will say.  I can be like a god, shaping reality to my whims, you will say.  And then, as you learn more details about how it actually works, you learn that time travel is not all that.  It’s not entirely pointless, it has some uses, but not anything like what you imagined.”

“You can’t change things?”

“Change isn’t even the right word.  Your language. . .  What you call time travel is really all about alternate dimensions.  Let’s imagine that I went back into the history of your world (which I have studied a bit, by the way), and I killed baby Hitler.  Then I averted all of your Second World War.”

“In Europe,” Pike interjected.  “The Second World War started with Japan and China.”

“Ah!  I guess I didn’t study your history in sufficient depth.  But the point is still valid.  The war in Europe could be averted, or at any rate would take a much different course without Hitler’s presence.  Are you with me so far?”

“Sure.  You changed history.”

“Yes and no.  I created a timeline, accessed an alternate reality.  It’s an independent spacetime continuum, extending infinitely in all directions.  Meanwhile, this timeline would still be here, and the carnage of that war as you remember it would still be just as real in this continuum.”

Pike scratched his chin and pondered.  “You could create an alternate timeline where the radiation accident doesn’t happen, but my fate would still be sealed in this timeline.  But wait. . .  What if you took me out of this timeline completely?  What if you took me in your time machine to that other spacetime continuum?  Then it would be absolutely impossible for me to be caught in the accident in this one, wouldn’t it?”

The Jex shrugged.  “Sure, I could do that.  But I’m not going to.”

Pike blinked.  “May I ask why not?  I mean, I understand that you don’t owe me anything.”

The Jex’s ears drooped slightly.  “Let me answer with a question of my own.  Why don’t you simply leave Starfleet?  Resign your commission and never look back.  Go find a new life.  Become an artist, or a beach bum, far away from any warp reactors.  What’s stopping you?”

He shook his head.  “It wouldn’t work.  People who’ve been to Boreth have tried to avoid their fate.  Something would happen, some bizarre circumstance would bring me back.”

She shook her head, mimicking his gesture.  “No it wouldn’t.  Causality doesn’t work like that.  Those other people who you’ve heard tried to avoid their fate: how hard did they really try?  How hard would you try, how far would you go?  But you haven’t done anything yet.  You could quit Starfleet, but you aren’t going to.”

“Oh?  And why am I not going to?” he asked.

“You tell me!  It’s your decision, after all.  But I suspect if you were going to make that decision, Boreth wouldn’t have shown you the vision that it did in the first place.  It showed you what you’re going to decide to do, not what you’re going to decide against.”

Pike was silent for a moment, brooding on that.  But the Jex took the opportunity to add, “Of course all this assumes that your vision at Boreth was a direct look into your future in this reality.  Who knows?  It could simply be a forecast, a prediction.  Maybe it’s a psychological trick.  Maybe people who see the visions find them so compelling, they can’t mentally bring themselves to avoid a fate that they already believe is real.”

Pike brightened up a little.  “Then what?  All I need to do is believe that I can change it?”

The Jex chuckled lightly.  “Something like that.  But that’s true in either case, isn’t it?  There’s no point asking for intervention from time travelers, or from the fates, or gods, or anyone else.  *It’s all on you.”* Captain Pike and a conversation about fate"

startrek,"Admiral Marcus From “Star Trek Into Darkness” – Cinema’s Most Underrated Villain

I’d like to make a case for a villain who has not been given his due credit as a layered, complex villain: Admiral Marcus from Star Trek Into Darkness.

1.  Admiral Marcus Is A Genius

After awakening the superhuman Khan to harness his superior intellect in developing advanced weaponry and ships, Khan went rogue. The decision to awake Khan, made by Marcus, might be seen as highly idiotic by some, but in my humble fact, this was a genius decision. JJ &amp; Lindelof heavily implied that Marcus must have spent several, possible millions of sleepless nights wondering about the future of Starfleet, the observable universe and his place in it. Marcus knew that at least some aliens were bad and that he is awesome. It was because of this, Marcus realized that he was the only person fit to take the eventual throne of Emperor of the Universe. So, what does he do? Asks a cryogenically frozen man to build him a big ship. Bigger in fact, than Kirk’s already big, big ship. Marcus’s ship was very big. He knew that a ship should be big, because it is intimidating to the aliens that were infesting his future empire. I believe Lindelof was also implying that in the future, Marcus had plans to not only keep his big ship, but to make it bigger. These decisions by Marcus illustrate a true leader. 

Big.

2.  Tying Up Loose Ends

With Khan on the run, Marcus knew his days of being held in high regard at Starfleet were numbered. He knew he had to terminate Khan, but without a precise location, this was exceedingly difficult. But using his awesome imagination and his big ship, Marcus realized that torpedoes are weapons that are dangerous to most humanoid bodies. Marcus was able to uncover this information because he most likely read it in a book or asked the big ship’s computer. Marcus knew that he could talk to his ship’s computer, because during various walking trips getting lost in the ship, he noticed the computer had a voice that spoke in English. Marcus also knew that if he put the bodies of Khan’s crew in torpedoes that were fired from his big ship, or another big ship, these people would probably not survive the big explosion. With Kirk asking permission to kill Khan, Marcus seized the opportunity, knowing the torpedoes from his storage facility could fit on Kirk’s big ship if his assistant hired moving people to move them for him while he ate a hamburger in his quarters.

It is not explicitly shown in the film, but I think it was JJ’s intention that Marcus was Kirk’s father George, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the 2009 film. George Kirk was seen flying head first into Nero’s big (but not that big) ship, but George was never shown dying. Because of this, I believe the only logical explanation is that George was secretly nursed back to health by Nero’s torture scorpions after suffering sustainable face injuries which temporarily made him look like a scorpion. Since Marcus was revealed to have a daughter, Carol, who is a similar age to Kirk in the events of “Into Darkness”, I think George’s (Marcus’s) first move upon escaping Nero’s ship and returning to Earth, was to have celebratory sexual intercourse with a non-scorpion, human woman – Carol’s mother. I believe JJ was intending to reveal that Carol and Kirk were actually related – which would explain why Kirk leered at Carol while she was undressing. He was noticing a striking resemblance in how she undressed the same way he undresses before having sexual intercourse with tailed alien twins and green women.

Why did Marcus not tell Kirk he was his father? Well, he did, multiple times during “Into Darkness”. He called Kirk “son” at least eight times, which he thought would be enough for Kirk to deduct that this was his biological scorpion father speaking to him. When it was clear that Kirk was not getting the message, Marcus must have deemed Kirk an unworthy child, who should be fired upon by his big ship.

4.  “You’re not actually going to do this, are you?”

Faced with certain defeat on the bridge of USS BIG, Marcus knew that in situations like this, he should try and win, not lose. Win. Not lose, WIN. So, in order to avoid not winning, he says the following line to Kirk:

“You’re not going to actually do this, are you?”

Marcus was genuinely asking if Kirk was going to stop him on his path to ruling the galaxy. It was a logical question to ask, as Marcus was genuinely curious. Asking a question like this shows that Marcus is a human with above-average intelligence, unlike some movie villains, who possess below-average intelligence (See the shark from “Jaws” or the monkey from “King Kong”).

5.  Theory: Marcus Survived Khan Crushing His Skull

Khan was shown to be crushing Marcus’s skull, but we never actually see the outcome of this. It is my very logical theory that Marcus’s body was just a shell and the real Marcus was actually a space platypus that was puppeteering a fake human body from the inside. I have faith that I will see this Platypus iteration of Marcus in a future Trek film. I guess Kirk is also half-platypus?

6.  The Big ship idea is worth mentioning again.

His ship was big and it was (probably) his idea. Admiral Marcus ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" - Best Villain?"
startrek,"This episode had everything I would want from a NuTrek episode. 

Core issues around suicide, hatred, psychology, relationships, remorse, compromise and optimism. So many worthwhile themes condensed into just over an hour.

Its really powerful stuff. On an entirely different tier to modern television. Where do they get their writers? Seth MacFarlane needs more awards. ""Electric Sheep"" may be the best episode of Trek since 2005"
startrek,"Maybe an unpopular opinion but from both Discovery and Strange New Worlds, Anson Mount's Captain Pike is fast becoming my favourite Captain. Its like he looked at everything Picard has done and thought 'How would someone who could influence such a great character act?' And he's done it perfectly. Also Ethan Peck is perfect as a younger Spock.

Thoughts? New Favourite Captain?"

startrek,"We have gotten Strange New Worlds based off the original pilot for TOS. Season 3 of Picard may be a revival of sorts of TNG, I have seen discussions as to wether or not DS9, VOY or Enterprise should be revived, We are getting a Section 31 show based on the idea created in DS9 and fleshed out in Discovery. I've heard pitches for lost era (Enterprise B and C) Trek, but not for Star Trek Phase 2. I know alot of it was retooled and re packaged for TMP and again for TNG. But I for one would like to see Roddenberry's true vision for Star Trek Phase II given a second chance at life. Given the stellar job they've done so far with Strange New Worlds they could probably do an at least passable job with it. Why haven't there been discussions about reviving Star Trek Phase II?"

startrek,"This was on cable when I as randomly channel surfacing.  Although I’ve watched it so many times over the decades since I was a child that I know it practically by heart, I was AGAIN struck by just how surprisingly good it is for a piece of 1960s network television.  ”City on the Edge” still wins the title for Best Episode of TOS, IMHO, but damned if this isn’t one of the best hours in all of Trek.  Some thoughts on why:

\-  It’s just a great concept and great story; an alien robot weapon from a long dead civilization in another galaxy that is maybe thousands or even millions of years old posing a seemingly unstoppable threat to our galaxy.  With the establishment of the dead Constellation (which in turn establishes that the Enterprise will likely fare no better) and a few minutes of dialogue about the machine’s planet killing capabilities, origin and course towards Rigel, the episode swiftly establishes one of the greatest existential threats Star Trek ever dealt with.  

\-  The script is almost flawless in terms of dialogue and pacing.  There are no pauses for comedic relief,  filler, yucks, or needless exposition.   

\- The directing and cutting is a masterclass.  The acting is spare, the blocking of the actors’ movements is very tight and the scenes are well composed and cut to create tension and fast (but not frantic) action.  It never slows down but also never loses the plot.

\-  Star Fleet has never looked more military and professional in the bridge talk, technobabble and discussion of regulations. 

\- The specially composed music for the episode is brilliant, almost Wagnerian in dissonance and perfectly conveys the implaccable, unstoppable danger posed by the machine.  As a child the music alone frightened me. 

\-  William Windom’s acting as Decker is some of the best acting by a guest star.  He takes us on a journey with Decker from tragic figure in the wreckage of his ship (which was no doubt just as important to him as the 1701 is to Kirk) mourning his choices and dead crew, to an obsessed Ahab-like villain, to tragic figure again whose death we mourn(“a commander is responsible for the lives of his crew…and their deaths.  Well, I should have died with mine”).  “Don’t you think I know that?!…there was \[a third planet\], but not anymore…”   That line would have looked a bit ridiculous on the page…something you might laugh at, but Windom’s delivery makes it remarkably moving. 

\- Even the extras – Scotty’s damage control team, the two security guards posted by the turbolift doors on the bridge– do more than the usual amount of acting by random people in Enterprise uniforms.  I particularly like Mr. Montgomery and the African-American guard.  Watch them closely in the battle scene when the machine is blowing the insides out of the Enterprise; the black guy looks to his left at Montgomery as if to say “oh,shit…dude, we are fucked!”   Also, Mr. Montgomery gets props for being the one security guard in all of TOS who got a karate punch shot in and decked a higher paid and billed actor.  (He should still be ashamed of himself for being bested by a wheezing old Commodore, but I digress..).

\- That moment when Spock relieves Decker is one of the best in all of TOS.  ”Commodore, I would not like to place you under arrest.” “You wouldn’t DARE.”  Wordless beckoning to the two guards, who immediately step right up.  With that gesture, Decker knows the entire crew supports Spock and he needs to comply.  Vulcans never bluff, they just play hardball. 

\- Particularly with the remastered special effects, the space battles are THE best in TOS.  By a long way. 

\- Shatner could absolutely have chewed the carpet with some of the moments and lines he was given, but he didn’t.  His performance was generally understated, and there was some nice use of lighting to further convey his emotions.  When Decker goes on his suicide run, Kirk’s eyes had been specially lit when he was trying to convince his friend not to commit suicide; when Decker dies, Kirk drops his head so his entire face is in shadow.  Subtle and effective.

\-  ONLY thing that was a mild detour into 60s camp — and mercifully happened only at the very end — was Kirk’s joke that he found “the one” doomsday machine “quite sufficient” with the jaunty flute music they used to lighten tension.  Ummmm…an entire starship crew is DEAD (horribly, no doubt, if you think about what it would be like to be on a planet chopped up into rubble from orbit), your friend just died in front of you, and an existential threat to the galaxy was just averted.   No time for jokes Jim! LOL

Even with the length of this (for which I apologize), I could go on and on.…top 5 episode in TOS for sure and certainly the best pure action TOS episode. In Praise of “The Doomsday Machine”"
startrek,"Star Trek seems to have a worrying habit of portraying fascism as brutal but effective. Just look at the Terran Empire and the Confederation as examples, both seem more advanced and more powerful than the Federation (I imagine thats because they just plundered what tech they wanted and didnt bother playing nice). Though I guess it could be argued that the Terran Empire overextended itself and that was the main reason for its ultimate downfall. 

Then theres the Orwellian Dystopian nightmares that are the Romulans and the Cardassians where it seems like Big Brother won and everyone is just kinda okay with it. Im not sure I like the way Star Trek portrays fascism..."

startrek,"While I'm enjoying Strange New Worlds (and I think it's one of the best Trek series ever made that looks and feels like Star Trek  —as opposed to other recent incarnations), it misses an important element to the Trek lore: treknobabble.

It feels that the show is almost there, considering the visual style and the amount of diagrams we saw on screen so far. I want to find out more geeky details about the warp core, about the dilithium crystals, the ship's nacelles, the transporter, even details about the Enterprise itself that were overlooked in TOS, on the same line as TNG/VOY. Make up words and measurement units, I don't care, but be consistent. I want Strange New Worlds to be more technical and to offer the same treknobabble consistency as TNG offered back in the days.

I tried contacting the mods with mod mail before posting this (asking for permission) but it's been a while and no answer in sight and I love to get things done before the deadline so here I am!

I got initiated to Star Trek by my mom and have been slowly catching up to all the series, movies etc. and I'm slowly (quickly) getting obsessed with it.

Our school system here needs us to do a written work about a topic of our choosing in order to pass the year and my intention is to revolve it around fan culture with a big insight into the star trek fandom and how it helped shaping what are now considered normal fan practices. In this work there must be at least one interview with a person that has to something to do with our topic eg. an expert, a professor or in my case, a long time fan. 

For this, I'd love to have a Trekkie (Trekker?) that has been following Star Trek for a long time and has witnessed the rise of the fandom/takes part in events or even organizes some! 

The interview would be conducted online and I'd need a screenshot as proof (so webcam on) :) The language is english so don't worry, you don't need to know german. The questions would be around the fandom, your history as a fan, your opinions on your fandom and others etc. 

I really hope somebody can help me -or even point me to the right direction in finding somebody that actually can. Need a long time Trekkie to interview!"

startrek,"A couple times come to mind for me: Data’s death in Nemesis (and final death in Picard, for that matter), The Inner Light’s ending (enough said), but none more so than Spock’s death in Wrath of Khan - first time I saw that simply wrecked me.

After Lower Decks ends in the fall, how long can we expect the break to be to the new seasons of the other shows? Picard is expected in spring 2023 according to some sites I saw. That's a long break if it's the next show up.

Since Discovery just started filming and Strange New Worlds is wrapping up, any chance Strange New Worlds season 2 releases before Discovery season five? 

Anyone have any more/different details? Is there any anticipated release schedule for star trek over the next year yet?"
startrek,"A new ship with new technology!

The OG Voyager being overall one of the earliest intrepid class starships and being brand spanking new when it was sent on its unintentional 7 year mission. The ship was full of new technology from the ships computer to its EMH, later ECH, warp 9 engine and variable positional nacelles. It also was a ship that encountered and utilized quite a bit of alien technology. Yet we never really get to see this tech implemented in more star fleet vessels. The Voyager-J being featured and name dropped multiple times throughout Discovery's 3rd and 4th seasons. 

The USS Protostar being a starship that is based on the silhouette of the USS Voyager. Even having a Captain Janeway hologram, and like it's muse. It also has an experimental engine. 

Captain Archer is the man who was instrumental in the formation of the federation. He was able to take the interests of many different alien species and help them align into one. Surely a Spacedock with his name would be capable of combining tech from many different Aliens into a single ship.

Picard S1 gave us the Artifact, an abandoned borg cube. We spent an entire season in and around it. Picard S2 gave us a hint of the result of this research: ""The Star Gazer"". A refit of an older starfleet vessel, but simultaneously the first of a new class of starship utilizing borg tech.

The 10c is a race with far more advanced tech than even the 32nd century federation. Based on previous evidence. I believe we are getting a new USS Discovery class or at the very least a brand new experimental USS Discovery. Based on the advancements we saw in Disco S4. I'm predicting better shielding, a new power source, a new style of transporter, a way to visit planets without EV suits, wormhole creation,  and new ways to communicate with species we've yet to encounter. What does the Voyager-J, the USS Protostar, the Archer Spacedock, The Artifact from Picard S1, the Star Gazer from Picard S2, 10c, and the USS Discovery have in common?"
startrek,"Animation in the 1970s unlocked the maximum potential for storytelling that has been unparalleled ever since. The simple Filmation graphics made it possible to depict advanced technology and alien worlds without the constraining costs of special effects driving the visuals. 

Paradoxically, the shows target audience in the Saturday morning cartoon slot also resulted in some of the worst stories.

I couldn't find much online or in my memory of episodes of particular Starfleet traditions for promotion.

startrek,"It just occured to me that we laugh at the Pakleds in ""Lower Decks"" hailing from ""Planet Pakled"", but we consider it perfectly normal for ""Vulcans"" to be from the planet...""Vulcan""? I almost wish ""Trek"" had enforced the species as ""Vulcanian"". Or the planet as ""Vulcan Prime"" or ""Vulcanis"".

To put this into perspective, we don't call them ""Tellars"", ""Betazeds"", ""Romuluses"", or ""Qonoses"". We call them ""Tellarites"", ""Betazoids"", ""Romulans"", and ""Klingons"". Which is what makes ""Pakleds"" originating on ""Planet Pakled"" so funny. They aren't creative or intelligent enough to differentiate names.

But the uber-intelligent, beautifully creative ""Vulcans"" are from the planet...""Vulcan""? Not ""Vulcanis"", ""Vulcan Prime"" or anything like that. Just...""Vulcan""?

startrek,"There are some episodes in all the Star Trek series that are generally considered “good” but that also have plot holes, incongruities or things that just don’t make a lot of sense when you think about them. I was thinking this when TOS: “The Ultimate Computer” came on cable the other day. I’ve always liked that one a lot because it dealt with the issues of acceptable (and wise) use of AI, what being replaced by a machine can mean in terms of loss of humanity, and also because we get to see four of Enterprise’s sister ships and a nice space battle.

But when you think of it, the final battle that causes the loss of the Excalibur and many casualties on the Lexington, Hood and Potemkin doesn’t make a lot of sense. Everyone involved knew the Enterprise was under the control of the M5 AI. As soon as the Lexington was hit by full phasers in contravention of the rules of engagement, the four ships would have raised shields and presumably withdrawn to figure out what was going on. Wesley would never have put in a frantic call to Kirk saying “Enterprise, Jim, have you gone mad? Break off YOUR attack.” The most logical assumption in that situation would have been there was something wrong with the M5 — why would Wesely ever assume it was the fault of the humans still on the Enterprise? Of course it was the machine malfunctioning and the logical thing for Wesley to do was order his ships to shield up and withdraw — as the M5 allowed them to do after it killed the Excalibur — and figure out what was going on. Sure, I can come up with head cannon reasons for what we see, but its not very convincing. Maybe Star Fleet’s order to destroy the Enterprise so precipitously was precisely because they had concluded the M5 was out of control and Kirk’s skeleton crew needed to be sacrificed…but why? They had broken off and there was plenty of time to figure out a non-lethal way to deal with the situation. Doesn’t completely ruin my enjoyment of the episode however.

What are some other “good” episodes like that?

startrek,I’m rewatching DS:9 from the beginning and I have an honest email question: they tell us (and show us through flashbacks) that the station was built as part of a mining operation on Bajor.  Presumably whatever they were mining was being pulled out of the ground on Bejor and being transported to the station.  Why?  Did they ever explain why they would go the trouble or transporting ore to SPACE for processing?  Was it because it had to be done in a vacuum or something?  Because processing is dangerous? DS:9 - Why did Tarak Nore even exist?
startrek,"https://www.cinemablend.com/star-wars/5-ways-star-treks-starfleet-could-absolutely-destroy-star-wars-empire



I know this has been discussed,  but I read this article today.  I agree with his outcome.  However he says Starfleet could not compete in a ship on ship battle.   Totally disagree.  Phasers are far longer range than the empires capabilities. Federation ships could simply sit out of range and hammer empire ships, not to mention phasers are far more powerful weapons Starfleet vs. Galactic Empire"
startrek,He has 2 of them! I really want to see how Pike got those Cardassian medals.
startrek,"It just dawned on me that if Picard's final season is only going to be in February and if they only started filming Discovery's fifth season this week, then that means there won't be any live-action Trek for just over seven months straight. On the plus side, Lower Decks will air during that time and so will the second half of Prodigy, but it's not the same (plus, both will likely wrap up before Christmas). We're just over three weeks away from entering a 7-month period of no live-action Trek and I'm already feeling withdrawal."
startrek,"The Maquis are a fascinating topic among Trekkies, given how many posts there are about them on this sub-reddit alone, as they present a number of questions and issues, though I do think they could have been executed better. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. This post is looking at their war with the Cardassians from a moral lens using the criteria of a just war.

Obviously war and violence are terrible as they diminish or extinguish quality and quantity of life, but alas they are sometimes inevitable due to circumstances beyond our control. So how do we reconcile the ideal with the practical? We do our best to fight ""just wars"" as in morally justifiable conflicts based on specific criteria, which I will explain and compare to the Maquis.

1. Just cause, as in there must be a good reason to go to war, like defend from an invasion, prevent an atrocity, or right a wrong.
   1. Here the Maquis check out in a way. They are being attacked and harassed by Cardassian settlers who want them out of the DMZ, and are willing to kill to do it. Obviously defending yourself is a just cause for violence, but this is just the first criteria.
2. Just authority, meaning the war must be declared and prosecuted by a legally recognized authority. Here the Maquis fail on two fronts.
   1. They are never recognized as a sovereign state, merely a paramilitary terrorist organization. Sure they traded with the Klingons but this is not the same thing as official recognition.
   2. They do not seem to have a consistent internal organization. What is their government? Are they a republic? A monarchy? Commonwealth? United States? As far as we can tell they are a collection of semi-autonomous military cells fighting a common enemy, with limited authority between them. This is important because it raises questions about negotiations and diplomacy. If Central Command WERE to try and end the war diplomatically, who would they talk to? Who would they negotiate with? Who among the Maquis has the authority to declare the war over? Chakotay? Eddington? Riker? Who? Given their whole theme is ""we didn't agree to this"" would ALL the Maquis get a vote on negotiations? Would the entire organization have to be negotiated with? Or would some accept a peace treaty and the rest keep on fighting? Without a central authority to negotiate and enforce diplomatic agreements what chance do the Maquis have of having a lasting peace?
3. Just intention, meaning the war must be fought with the goal of achieving justice, not personal glory, wealth, or aggrandizement.
   1. Here the Maquis also fail, or at least three of their leaders certainly do: Cal Hudson, Michael Eddington, and Thomas Riker. Cal Hudson makes it clear that his military actions are about revenge, not peace or justice (""I will not allow those deaths to go unpunished""). Michael Eddington is living out his fantasy of a heroic melodrama, which is how Sisko ends up capturing him. And Thomas Riker wants to distinguish himself from William Riker, the man he was copied from. Now does this apply to the rest of the Maquis? Hard to say, but given these men have nearly no resistance to their actions it seems that the Maquis are pretty cavalier about the whole matter, which may indicate that they share similar intentions.
4. Last resort, meaning all diplomatic options must be exhausted first. Here the Maquis fail again as they had multiple opportunities to end the conflict without violence.
   1. Sisko, with the aid of Dukat, uncovers evidence of Central Command smuggling weapons into the DMZ, which was leverage the Maquis could have used to entice/force the Cardassians into a peaceful settlement, but instead they continued attacking the Cardassians, escalating the conflict, exactly as Quark so eloquently explains to a VULCAN of all people.
   2. The Cardassians all but abandon the DMZ when the Klingons invaded. From most accounts the Maquis had virtual free reign in the area, leaving them the de facto rulers and giving them basically what they wanted: freedom from Cardassian rule. This was a PERFECT opportunity to offer a peace settlement: recognize us as independent and we'll stop attacking you so you can focus on the Klingons. But instead, the Maquis continue attacking and even make forays into Cardassian space itself, further escalating tensions and making the situation worse.
   3. The Cardassians did not forbid the colonists from LEAVING the DMZ. So is it REALLY a last resort if you can just leave? Obviously not. Sure, they had lived on that land for a while and had built homes and lives, but is a piece of land worth risking a full-scale interstellar war over? Should a few disgruntled farmers complaints derail weeks or months of negotiations and risk the lives of millions of people? Given the Federation was willing to resettle them, and compensate them for their trouble, isn't this just being selfish and obstinate? If you can escape a violent situation without injury or loss of property, is violence really necessary?
5. Reasonable chance of success; no point in sending good men to fight a futile conflict.
   1. Here the Maquis actually qualify. Central Command can't send in their full might lest they escalate the war into a full-scale war with the Federation, a war that cost them ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" and left their people ""weak and miserable"" as Picard put it. Thus, the Maquis are fighting a war against armed colonial militias, a force like themselves, not a professional, organized military that has them outnumbered and outgunned.
6. Only sufficient force must be used to achieve victory.
   1. Here the Maquis fail. When the Cardassians all but abandon the DMZ they escalated the conflict not just by continuing the war but actually using biological weapons on civilian targets. Michael Eddington had enough made to essentially exterminate the whole DMZ. So they not only squander a great opportunity but they essentially make it impossible for the war to end peacefully; if you're willing to use biological weapons on women and children where do you draw the line? What rules of war are you NOT going to violate? Wouldn't it be safer to utterly destroy you?

Thus, based on the criteria used, the Maquis were NOT fighting a just war. They were not being fearless freedom fighters, but rather they were selfish, obstinate people who risked millions of lives just because they didn't want to give up their land. Now would the Cardassians have honored their side of the bargain? Probably not, given their track record, but this is about the Maquis, not the Cardassians.

Sorry for the rant, and I have no idea if you guys agree or disagree. But I felt that I had to get this out.

startrek,Anyone else lost all episodes on their app except episode 7? I was binge watching it to catch up today and they just disappeared. Discovery Season 4 on Paramount Plus
startrek,I was catching up on the new season of discovery on paramount+ and last night I finished episode 7. today I went to watch the next episode and none of the other episodes for season 4 are showing up except for episode 7. seasons 1-3 are there but somehow all of the rest of season 4 disappeared. every other show on paramount seems fine. anyone else having this issue?
startrek,Not a lot of people in their 70s look as good as she does.. Gates McFadden has aged SO well
startrek,"I imagine we all have crushes from the regular cast (for me, it's Nicole de Boer).

But what about guest stars? Who's your crush who only appeared in a single episode -- or maybe recurring, like Chase Masterson? As long as their name wasn't in the opening credits :-)

For me, it's Jill Sayre as Mardah on *DS9.* Absolutely gorgeous. Who is your guest star crush?"
startrek,"I’m not including Picard here because it’s pretty clear they only ever intended the three seasons.

To me, each of these shows has been solid with Strange New Worlds having the strongest start. How awesome would it be if they all got the TNG treatment? Seven seasons and however many films is a tall order, but it would be awesome to see it happen. I hope Star Trek Discovery (and each other non-Picard show) gets the full seven season and multiple movies treatment."
startrek,"I have all the series and movies, at least released to date on physical media, (mix of DVD and blu-ray like most of us I'll assume).  I display them in chronological order. Enterprise on the left and ending with Picard.   But with Discovery's time jump should I split the series or keep it grouped together?  Currently keep all of Discovery between ENT and TOS.  And let's not forget the movies, all one group or split off the TNG ones, plus what to do about the Kelvin time line

I know I am over thinking this but wonder what others have done.  I can only imagine I am not the only one facing these difficult decision. A question about display."
startrek,"Can't defend them intellectually but still appreciate them on some level. For example, I kind of love ""The Royale"" for its sheer pointless strangeness. It's one of the most avant-garde Star Trek episodes, completely by accident. What are episodes that fall into the ""endearingly bad"" category for you?"
startrek,"This is what I've been waiting for. I'm only in my thirties but my dad raised me and my brothers on Star Trek and since Voyager I've been kind of disappointed. Enterprise wasn't bad, true, but the kind of enjoyment I got from TOS, TNG, DS9,and VOY has been absent from my life until SNW. I don't think DIS is as bad as people sometimes say, and I haven't watched more than a couple episodes of Picard (how is it), but SNW is reaaaally doing the trick. I fucking love it.

Also, I really enjoy Lower Decks, dunno if that's an unpopular opinion or not. Ensign Mariner is annoying but I honestly love the show. Seeing ST in a silly way like that is just refreshing and fun. And the amount of easter eggs is absurd.

I wanna raise a glass of Romulan Ale to Star Trek still going strong after all these years. Strange New Worlds, scratching the itch! Also... I like LD."
startrek,"Does anyone else remember the Founders using the Klingons as their tools to commit genocide on the Cardasians? After the Federation figured it out, why wouldn't the Cardasians join a force in the Alpha quadrant vs joining the people who tried to have them all killed??? That would make as much sense as jews joining nazi Germany in the 40's. Or am I missing something here? Why did the Cardasians join the Dominion after the founders originally tried to commit genocide (using the Klingons)?"
startrek,"I've been seeing the DALL-E thing on the internet last few days and it reminded me of the Next Generation episode Schisms (Season 6 episode 5).

There's a scene on the holodeck where several people are describing to the computer the images they recall and it generates the objects on the fly.

With this DALL-E image generator, if it gets fast enough, it could be a basic version of that scene that generates in real time what you describe.

I could imagine further advances of this and it could generate full motion video as you narrate a story to your kids, or the child themselves tells a story and the computer animates it.

Has anyone else seen that DALL-E thing and had the same thought? DALL-E image generator - a basic holodeck?"
startrek,"I was looking thru the Trek library on Paramount+ and noticed the only Trek property not on Paramount+ is the 2009 reboot and wondering, why? The other Abrams movies are there hell Galaxy Quest comes up when you search Star Trek, a documentary called Building Trek, and some movie called Fear In The Night from 1947 starring Deforest Kelly. So why is Star Trek 2009 the only thing missing? Why isn't Star Trek 2009 reboot on Paramount+ ?"
startrek,"The Terran Empire kinda gets the excuse that its an alternative universe. But thats nots the case with the Confederation. They're humans, us just... we went the other way out of desperation. 

Kinda makes you understand the Cardassians a little more (the military basically took over after everything collapsed). The Confederation of Earth timeline is more frightening because its actually in our universe"

* Beverly Crusher's husband &amp; Wesley's dad killed under the command of Captain Picard. 
* Riker's wrong decision (as a young Ensign) to back Pressman with experimental cloaking technology.
* Troi had a sister that died when she was a child.
* Worf's parents were killed and he was orphaned with human parents
* Tasha Yar had to escape the rape gangs on Turkana IV
* Data came from a colony where the population was killed by the Crystalline Entity which was being given instructions from his evil brother
* Sisko was traumatized by the death of his wife / the battle of Wolf 359
* Bashir was secretly an augment
* Odo did some dark shit when he was in charge of security for Terok Nor under the Cardassians
* Kira was a terrorist
* O'Brien had trauma and racism from the Cardassian war
* Tom Paris was a disgraced former Starfleet officer and a failed Maquis traitor
* Tuvok was unable to control his emotions as a young Vulcan
* Torres was ashamed of her Klingon half and had daddy issues
* Kes came from an oppressed society that wasn't even aware of their own genetic abilities
* Neelix's family was killed in the Metreon Cascade which left him with significant PTSD
* 7 of 9 was a human child assimilated by the Borg
* The EMH wasn't even considered a real, sentient life form at first (and then later by his own creator)
* Captain Archer held a grudge against Vulcans because they held back Earth's warp program and his dad didn't get to see his Warp 5 engine in action
* Reed was secretly a member of Section 31
* T'Pol was secretly more emotional than was accepted by Vulcan society, enjoying jazz music in San Francisco and visiting Carbon Creek for sentimental reasons.
* Spock had major daddy issues (one reason being that he chose Starfleet over the Vulcan Science Academy) and struggled with his half-human, half-Vulcan biology.
* Uhura's parents were killed in a shuttle accident. My counter-argument to a specific criticism of SNW that I've been seeing"
startrek,"I think his character has potential. One of my favorite characters from DS9 for sure.
Need more stories about House of Quarks 😁, Quark's mother, stories about evading and competing against Brunt and Cousin Geila. We need a STAR TREK QUARK!"
startrek,"Anyone else utterly obsessed with this piece by Ron Jones from TNG? I never even noticed much of the music in the shows, unlike the films (well, mostly just wrath of khan and undiscovered country), until recently but I made a ""best ever"" ST playlist going through all shows and films and I've discovered a few gems as a result.

If someone were to stick a beat behind it, it would loop so well for all kinds of dance music too. 

It's just something really, really special imo.

startrek,"Was there ever a canon explanation as to why Quark talks differently than Rom, Nog, and the Ferengi bartenders that work for him?  The others talk with a Ferengi cadence and accent.  Quark seems to lack those ingredients when he speaks (aside from when he says, “hew-MON”…but even then it’s less Ferengi-ish than the others).  If I recall correctly both were raised together in the same household, so in theory their manner of speaking and all around mannerisms should be similar.  Was there ever a reason given? Ferengi"
startrek,"In just a few seasons, I feel like The Orville, while often in parody, manages to fulfill a large portion of the legacy of Star Trek, in a way that modern ST often fails to do. 
What do you all think? What do people think of The Orville?"
startrek,"In Sub Rosa the inherent gross idiocy of an entire lineage of women who keep getting raped by the ghost of their great great grand mother lover is, well, gross and fucked up. It is just fundamentally gross. Fucker says ""I loved her. And when she died I stayed with her daughter. And then her daughter's daughter..."" 🤢🤮

The reason I struggled to finish watching the fucking episode is the jarring expectation that TNG wants you to think the ship doctor of the Federation's flagship (someone with the power to relieve Picard of command) essentially turns into a bumbling teenager on hormones who goes from beink ok to absolutely *addicted* to the ghostly sexual carresses and other gross touch of what at one point she learns is a himicidal malevolent ghost who was also her 100 year old's grandmother's 30 year old lover. Bleuch.. yea. Her 100 year old grandma wrote ""erotic"" journal entries about a 30 year old lover and not only does the Enterprise doctor finds thats OK to read, she ends up having nice sexy dreams coz of it and the ship counsellor *sanctions* this and even becomes *envious*. And the doctor gets raped by her grand mother ghost lover. Did i say that already? Is it sinking in? W.t.a.f? 

Until I watched this episode, I thought no episode will ever reach the level of gross idiocy, crass racism and stupid ineptitude that shat out ""Code of Honor"". There has never been in the history of ""decent"" TV an episode that so violently nauseated me. And yes, that racism is probably *the absolute worst*. But Sub Rosa is nastier in every other aspect. The rape culture, the sexism, the cringe, the whole throwback to that period when women were ""hysterical"" or absolutely out of control,  the ew-ness of it all. 

I really only wish this fucking episode came much earlier than the final season as that would've definitely put me off from ever continuing to watch this official. At least Code of Honor came much earlier, which gave the show chances to redeem itself. 

Like, just how old was the fucking moron who wrote this? How did it ever manage to be of on film? Sub Rosa, Code of Honour are the worst episodes of star trek TNG ever."
startrek,"That really upsets me. To clarify: this isn't intended to be another dunk on *Discovery.* It's more-so me expressing frustration and disappointment that after four years, much of the cast of *Disco* still doesn't feel familiar and friendly or familial to us. Outside of Tilly, Saru, Culber, and (like her or hate her) Burnham, the rest of the cast is just people. Mini-arcs that last a couple episodes like Detmer's PTSD are hollow and waste potential. Potentially big areas of conflict like Stametz's disdain for Burnham's willingness to sacrifice his family for the greater good of the Federation are simply never acknowledged again. Owo is from a society on Earth that rejects modern technology and space? That's fascinating! *Tell us more.* Why did she leave? How was that received by her family? Did it cause irreparable damage? Detmer has a best friend she sends a goodbye letter two in season 2. Who is it? Why is she so important? Is she also in Starfleet?

Owo and Detmer are very clearly friends - show us more of their friendship on and off the clock! Rhys' village was wiped out by a hurricane. Ok...how did that affect him? Is that why he joined Starfleet? 

Those are all stories that are completely lost in *Disco's* insistence on season-long arcs. We're left with so many questions.

Now contrast that to *SNW*. We feel more familiar with Pike after 6 episodes this season than any other captain. We're getting great backstory fill-in on Uhura. La'An's trauma was hinted at in episode 1 and returned to for its own story in episode 4. We've already learned the origins of Una. Spock's personal life has even had its own episode I haven't watched yet.

Don't get me wrong, I will watch Discovery season 5. I just hope they take time to explore the characters just an iota more and don't ignore that because *SNW* is doing it instead. We know more about the bridge crew after 6 episodes of SNW than we do after 4 seasons of Discovery"
startrek,"I’m seeing lots of Batman references in Strange New Worlds&gt;!Doctor M’benga is keeping his daughter “frozen” like Mr. Freeze does with Nora, the scratched coin seen during episode 6 is obviously a reference to Harvey Dent/Two Face and in the same episode Alora has red hair and green nail polish like Poison Ivy!&lt; Batman references in Strange New Worlds"
startrek,"Just watched this, and I was immediately struck by how much of the underlying concept and setup is lifted from the classic (and highly recommended) short story, [The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas), by Ursula K. Le Guin.

Le Guin's story is a philosophical piece that has no action as such.  It simply describes a situation, a scenario, with a rather disturbing moral conundrum for the reader to contemplate.  So, obviously, SNW took that scenario and added a plot line, and got Enterprise mixed up in it too.  In the short story we never knew where ""The Ones Who Walk Away"" went to.  In SNW we know they formed their own breakaway colony and are now trying to actively subvert the system.  There was never a hint of anything like that from Le Guin, but it's right in line with what I expect from Star Trek.

Not criticizing SNW here.  Ideas have to come from somewhere, and they borrowed from one of the best, and then they put their own spin on it.  I just thought it would be fun to point out, in an educational way, for those less familiar with the literature. SNW Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach / The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"

startrek,"Hey fellow Trekkies! 🖖 I've been thinking about buying/building scale model kits for all the major starships in ST. Trouble is, I don't know where to start. I know I'd like them to all be in the same scale. I've googled and can't make heads or tails of all the various options. I haven't built a model kit in probably ~35 years, and that was just a half-assed attempt as a ~9-10yo building an Enterprise-D kit when those first came on the market.

Are there some models/ships that only come in a specific scale while others have more options? Any brands/types that are better than others? Any suggestions on where/what to buy? Grateful for any tips/guidance, even if it's just pointing me to a place where I can learn more information. Star Trek Model Kits?"
startrek,"I have genuine gripes with the series, the writing, the lack of character development, etc. But one episode really does stand out for me: ""The Sound of Thunder"" (2x06). Call me sentimental but, it really did ring ""Trek"" for me. Aliens, initially shocked that they are not alone in the universe. That there is something out there besides death (Kelpians and Ba'ul predation/culling) in the stars. DISCO gets a lot of hate, but what Episodes do you adore?"
startrek,"This thought came to me as I was 3D printing my third Star Trek ship model. I just get a compulsion to have a model of the ships from Trek that I don’t have with any of the other franchises I’m a fan of.

Like I love the Millennium Falcon, but I have no desire to have a model of it, meanwhile, in the past few days I’ve printed the Enterprise A, the Discoprise, and I’m in the process of printing the Enterprise E.

What are your guys’ thoughts. What sets a Star Trek ship apart from, say for instance, a Venator, or The Pegasus? Of course you may also disagree, in which case, please tell me your thoughts and feelings. Random thought I had. Why do we appear to have more of an affinity for the starships in Trek than other sci-fi series?"
startrek,"I quite like it, like a lot a lot. And I don't have issues with the old/""aged"" visuals and stuff, it's never bothered me. But I've heard that a lot of people rank it lower and I for some reason feel bad if I like all the shows/movies in a franchise. So I don't know exactly why I'm making this post, just to vent I guess? I've started watching TOS (my first Star Trek show) and I feel bad about how much I'm enjoying it."
startrek,"So, I just finished episode nine of season two of *Star Trek: Picard*. As with all modern ST I'm sure it has all sorts of supporters and detractors and lengthily video essays dissecting every throwaway line and comparing it to every show before it--and overall I'm really enjoying it so far, much more so than the previous season, minus a few characters forgetting that their guns have stun settings.

Now, I've not finished the season yet, but I do want to discuss Picard's mother, Yvette, specifically her mental illness.

The sad story of Yvette Picard is stretched out like too little buttle over too much bread for nine whole episodes, all of it detailing Yvette's struggle with mental illness and (surprise) eventual suicide. I have several criticisms of the matter.

To begin with, Yvette's mental illness is never specified. It's vaguely referred to as (paraphrasing here) ""A great darkness,"" ""Episodes,"" etc. She demonstrates symptoms of various mental disorders, but by and large she suffers from typical Generic Hollywood Mental Illness.

Rather than doing some actual research on a real-life mental illness that affects people, rather than accurately identifying that illness in the show and portraying its symptoms and how people cope and what it does to a family, rather than showing ways of dealing with it, instead, *Picard* goes the route of the Generic Hollywood Mental Illness. Rather than showing how you can support people struggling with mental illness, rather than showing what a mental disorder does to a person, its origins, its treatment, *Picard* goes the lazy route and deals with it all ambiguously purely to give Picard a tragic backstory.

I feel that this method of portraying mental illness is reductionist and harmful, and am saddened that it continues to be propagated by Hollywood in this day and age.

Now, if this story took place in the 19th century, I could excuse it, but Picard's flashbacks take place in the 25th century. Canonically, mental illness, at least in *TOS*, is eliminated, as per ""Whom Gods Destroy,"" wherein only 15 people remain in the galaxy who are incurably mentally ill. Now, Star Trek has always played fast and loose with established canon, which I do not mind.

However, Star Trek has, by and large, in my opinion, portrayed mental illness fairly modernly. True, ""Whom Gods Destroy"" is a tad simplistic, but need I remind you that *Next Generation* in its era was revolutionary for having a psychiatrist as part of the main crew. This, combined with ST's overall optimistic view of the future, is salt in the wound. 

Rather than getting Yvette in an institution with professional help, rather than medicating her and keeping an eye on her at all times, Maurice gives her rampant freedom and then locks her in a cell without keeping Jean-Luc in the loop. I realize humans are flawed, but Maurice's actions, frankly, in my opinion, don't fit in with ST's vision of a bright future.

What purpose does Yvette's melodrama (and retconned suicide, might I add) serve, beyond dampening the spirits of the season even more? As near as I can see, she's a textbook case of romanticized poorly-researched mental illness, stuffed in the fridge to give our hero an unnecessarily tragic backstory. And I honestly don't think that's in keeping with the Star Trek tradition.

TL;DR: Mental illness complex, Yvette Picard's characterization dumb, do better ST.

startrek,"New Trek fan here.

Before Covid, I had never seen a Star Trek show. Now, I have now watched them all back to back (thanks, Paramount). Every episode of every season, except the animated one. For the most part, they were excellent and I get the appeal. I’m glad I did it. Here’s my uninformed layman ranking:

1. Next Generation. This one had the best captain. Great crew, I liked Geordi and Data quite a lot. Not a big fan of Wesley Crusher or Bev.
2. (Tie). Strange New Worlds. This is the best show in the series if it keeps on its pace. Some top shelf sci fi.
3. Voyager. Best cast overall. In some ways, this was a better show than TNG. Well written. Every character was likable, especially the doctor and 7 of 9. Didn’t care for Tom Paris. Janeway was a top 3 captain.
4. Enterprise. Why was this one so short? The temporal war was kind of corny (full of paradox and holes) but I liked Archer, Skip, Tupal, and the Flox. It was a good show. Could have lasted longer
5. DS9. Pretty distant 4th place for me, because I didn’t fall in love with the characters despite this being so many seasons. They never grew on me like Voyager’s did. Dax was especially cringe. Quark is the exception, I did enjoy him. Of all the shows on this list though, this one and TOS had the best sci fi writing. The dominion plot line was excellent. Good story arc.
6. The Original Series. This was a good show, it just showed its age a bit too much for my personal taste. Like DS9, the stories were excellent. The characters, though, never quite grew on me, despite being household names (Kirk, Spock, Scotty) which surprised me
7. Picard. It might have been higher on the list but I don’t think it was trying to be a trek show. Picard’s character is nothing like TNG, and seven’s nothing like Voyager. In a vacuum, this would be a good show but considering it’s supposed to be a sequel, it wasn’t faithful to its predecessors and that distracted me

7 Discovery. Personal preference only, but this show never did it for me. It never hooked me quite like the others. Doesn’t make it a bad show, but the others had stronger characters and plotlines I believe. And better Klingons.

Finally, I watched another non-trek show called Battlestar Gallactica and if you haven’t seen it, do. It was excellent. Possibly #1 on this list, if it were trek. Ranking the Trek Shows"
startrek,"I was looking at the Eaglemoss figure of the USS Melbourne and took an interest to the smaller warp nacelles on the ventral drive section. Upon closer inspection the hull below it has a shape similar to that of the Delta flier and it got me thinking: perhaps as a the Melbourne is a long range exploration vessel that part is a scout vessel, or perhaps even an emergency escape vessel should the crew need to evacuate.

startrek,"Without wishing to spoil too much, the ending of the recent ep made me think about episodes of previous trek where the outcome was, let's say, less than positive.  A few that came to mind...

The Offspring - Lal's death, obviously

The Survivors - the ending whilst not particularly negative, was very much unresolved.  Just leaving the alien, alone on his planet with his imaginery wife.  Picard says that the Fed had no laws which could scale to what he had done, something about his solitude being the most fitting punishment.

The High Ground - as soon as Picard and Beverly are rescued, the Enterprise leaves, no conclusion to the problems, no follow up captain's log.  Just gone.

I enjoyed this SNW episode, as I have all so far, also enjoy those TNG episodes listed above.  I guess it shows that the good guys, or even 'not bad guys' in some cases don't always have to win for a story to be effective.

Anyone else have examples of this accross the star trek world? SNW Ep6 - Very TNG like ending"
startrek,"recently remembered that Tim Russ (Tuvok) had a music career while entrancing my sister Leonard Nimoy's Hobbit song.

It's SO VERY late 90's-early 2000's. 

From back when we saw all the problems coming but still thought that we could or would DO SOMETHING about them. 

It was SO HOPEFUL. It BELIEVED that we would and could make a difference.

startrek,"So I always knew about star trek and watched all kinds of sci-fi stuff from dark matter to killjoys and now I'm left here punching myself for not starting to explore the content of star trek . I'm starting with TNG from season 1. When I was trying to figure out where to start almost everyone said to strat from 3rd season because of the ones before being worse and yet still I find this show amazing / watching it I can't imagine what changes at the 3rd . Also I want to note I'm pretty young and so this show that started in 1987 that understandably has bad effects does not bother me at all purely because of the crazy good episode plots and protagonist characteristics. To add to my excitement is that there is much content to watch ... To compare -people praise Naruto or One-piece anime to be lengthy with 16days watch time vs all Star Trek content more then 31days.
TL;DR - I'm happy I finally started watching Star Trek and can't wait to absorb all of its content. Now I understand"

It’s what modern Star Trek should have been and I hope it lasts 20 seasons. Also, let  Seth Macfarlane be the show runner and head creative director of the next Star Trek series.

startrek,"Now if the Equinox crew hadn't used the aliens, or Voyager hadn't found out, I'm assuming Tuvok or Tom would be made his XO, and the crews split between the two ships.

If they had managed to stop the aliens, without the ships destruction, Ransom would obviously be striped of rank, and confined to quarters. With good behaviour, maybe allowed to assist on the ships.

Tuvok or Chakotay would have command of the Equinox, with Tom as XO. And once again, the crews split between the two. The ship may have been lost at some other point, but if it hadn't, it certainly would have been interesting. If the USS Equinox hadn't been destroyed, how do you think things would have worked?"
startrek,"Just rewatched this episode and realized that the landing party spends the whole episode in what is basically an alien holder.  Since the tech doesn't exist yet in the Federation, Kirk &amp; crew can't figure out what's going on, but Spock gradually concludes that they're in some kind of unreal environment where the laws of physics don't exist.

I hadn't seen this episode in years, and of course since TNG the holodeck has become ubiquitous.  So while watching it dawned on me that the way the characters (writers) described what was going on with the events in ""the town of Tombstone, AZ on Oct 26, 1881"" was exactly how someone who had never encountered a holodeck would describe the experience of being trapped in one in someone else's story program.

I have a whole new appreciation for this episode and the writer (Gene L. Coon writing as Lee Cronin) who conceptualized this story at a time when a holodeck was an utterly unknown concept.  

Thoughts?  Am I off base here?  Or is this one more thing that TOS got right? Change my mind: 1st appearance of the holodeck is in TOS S3E6 ""Spectre of the Gun"""

startrek,"SPOILER if you’ve not seen S1E5 SNW:

Finally watching S1E5 of SNW and I love the solar flare ship actually being seen/referenced outside of just DS9. I can’t recall when else it may have been used in any of the shows or movies but it was really cool to see. I always loved that episode and the ingenuity of it all. Solar Flare Ship"
startrek,"Spoilers for this week’s episode ahead.  

TLDR:   Brave enough to lose.  

So there is this moment when watching The Dark Knight when you realize that the Joker will do bad things that are normally prevented by the hero in a movie.  And in that moment you also realize to your excitement, shock, and horror that the film makers are not going to hold him back to fit into the traditional hero story.  For me that moment is when he blows up Rachel.  You realize from that moment on that anything can happen in this movie and nothing is predictable.  

The end of Empire is a bit the same.  The rebels pretty much lose in that movie.  Han is frozen and taken.  Luke gets some bad news.  I’m certain there are other examples.  New Caprica in BSG.  Marco’s big plan in the Expanse.  The best fiction doesn’t just harp on close calls and heroic wins.  It is at its best when you see the heroes struggle and sometimes fail.  When they show they are vulnerable and human.  It’s not something you see a lot of in episodic TV however.  

This week in SNW the good guys lose.  Full stop.  Pike allows himself to be manipulated (quite obviously) and while his crew races for answers he is distracted. The end result is a kid pays the price.  And what a great bit of acting from Anson Mount shows us after.  He is pissed off.  At the woman who betrayed him.  At her whole planet.  And mostly I think, at himself.  

In my past life I represented abused kids as a lawyer.  A ‘guardian ad litem’.   It was gratifying to see the calculation that Pike made to immediately prioritize saving the boy over everything else.  Sacrificing his own well-being in the future first and foremost.  He gives up the proffered opportunity to take the easy way out of his hard future because it it the right thing to do.  I know personally that sometimes you can’t help everyone you try to.  It’s very difficult to live with.  Years later I still deeply regret a lot of cases I wasn’t able to win and what may have happened to those kids because of my failure.  

The fact that SNW is willing to go there is kind of awesome.  It reminds me of Sisko living with it.  This show is hitting way above what I thought it’s weight class was.  If it continues on with this level of excellence it could be one of the best science fiction shows ever.   

Just my two credits from a guy who knows about loss. SNW goes for it."
startrek,"I’ve watched a lot of trek but it’s been over many years. I for the life of me can’t remember there being any reference to Pike beyond TOS. Canonically at least, I’m also not sure if he’s appeared or been referenced in any other Trek media.

I ask this to kind of see if the show will always end up with Pike facing his fate in the Menagerie or, if the show will find a plot arc that saves Pike from that fate while saving the crewmen he does. The only way I could see that is if Pike’s horrific fate is never referenced again beyond TOS. I feel like they could craft a story to just address the menagerie and yet, still spare Pike.

I know all of this is a long long long way off, hoping for many seasons of SNW but, just wondering if the show is truly pigeoned holed into the end of Pike’s character arc. Question about Pike’s history…"

startrek,"I don't know how to put this into words, but I feel like the message of ""Q&amp;A"" is altered by Una's revealed Augment status, casts the episode into a different light (no pun intended). The message I gleaned from the ST is that ""you have to hide your freaky for the sake of your career,"" while in the episode it's sort of a light-hearted maintaining the chain of command. After ""Ghosts of Illyria"", I can't help but feel like it casts the episode into a darker light (no pun intended), as if Una's Augment status is revealed she loses her commission, at best.

Gene Roddenberry wanted to show society of the 20th Century that humans had risen above war, bigotry/racism, accumulation of wealth, poverty, etc.  My theory is humanity succeeded in rising above ***contained to humans only.***

Dr. McCoy sure lambasted Spock a lot about him being Vulcan, ""Green blooded so and so..."" etc.  Kirk was basically racist against Klingons until The Undiscovered Country.  All throughout TNG, DS9, and Voyager the whole crew made derogatory comments about the Ferengi, the Cardassians, the Romulans, the Klingons, the Vulcans...

We also see plenty of humans still consumed by wealth and the chase for more: Harry Mudd and Vash to name just a couple.

The ***human*** colonists of Legara IV were also known as the ghetto folks of the Federation - Tasha Yar was raped for crying out loud!

What am I getting at?  I am not sure, but looking at Star Trek like this shows humans still have a long way to go, even in the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and now even the 31st Century...could it be this is the ideal - kind of like our Bill of Rights and Constitution, Declaration of Independence are what an ideal society looks like, but we fail to live up to it?

Or I don't care? what is your preferred term?"
startrek,"Oh my Sha-Ka-Reh, that half was wonderful!
I really was no fan of Discovery before. I liked to watch it since it's Star Trek, but we know alle the flaws — weird plotlines, focusing on people rather than the crew, modern story writing vs. classic Star Trek story writing, backtracking with uninteresting side characters, TOO MUCH BURNHAM EMOTIONS.
My point of being bothered by the plot completely came with the DMA: a galaxy threatening threat AGAIN, that OnLy The CReW of ThE diScOvErY can save (hell, that ship has technology from so many hundreds of years, refitting it equals it only to the then-modern ships, how could it became the best ship they had!?), and so on.

But man, going off beyond our galaxy was SO GOOD!
It started for me with the preparations. For the first time I really felt that the galaxy depends on the crew of the Discovery. I felt the fear and tension of the crew and the ambassadors, I believed it, other than before where it was clear (to me) that they will not dye the next time the stupid Alien with a strange connection to Dilithium sneezes.

Don't get me wrong, things like Booker and his new friend doing their own thing and taking a hostage was, once again, boring. But hear me out, when they crossed the galactic border it felt so much like old Star Trek. And then the strange planet where I was thrilled what the creators of the DMA are and what they do and why and and and ...
And then the Aliens showed up and THEY FELT LIKE REAL STAR TREK ALIENS. I couldn't believe my eyes, they remembered me of the crystaline creature or the care taker. Star Trek has always been about slapping some prosthetics and/or color on people and the unnamed species #0815 is created. But they got abstract creatures as well and that was what I really missed.

So, it seems like this is an appreciation post about 1/8 of Discovery. The rest is not that good, but this part was, at least for me. The last half of DIS season 4 was worth watching all that came before"

Eventually he returns to his original location where, out of frustration, he walks through the door and arrives at his destination. Silly idea for an episode of Discovery"
startrek,"This is just for fun. But I thought of this as a way to make the canon work, even when it contradicts itself.

So the original timeline is just The Original Series through Nemisis. 

Then you have the Kelvin timeline.

But the third and current timeline splits off from First Contact. It starts with Enterprise and inludes every show out since discovery. We just assume that all the same things that happened in the original timeline happened here but in a way that fits. Thus when they contradict canon, it's canon for this timeline. Just a fun timeline theory."

startrek,"Just binged Picard season 2. Can someone explain what happened to Voyager? If the Borg Queen has been adulterated, did they strand Voyager? Are there multiple queens? Q? WTF? Little help?"
startrek,"We saw each other recently and he updated me how he likes the show now. At first he was apparently very lost and found it slow-moving. I told him it was reminiscent of the original show, which I love. He also thinks it’s all about Uhura and no one else?… 😂 Anyway, I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn’t recall the pilot from the original with Pike, and he’s also never seen Discovery, so I explained the episodes to him with Pike and Spock and so on. 

(For any Stranger Things fans, he also thinks season four, volume one is actually season four, and volume two is actually season five. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I even sent him a letter by the Duffer Brothers about the seasons and break, etc.)

Anyway, wondering if he’s at all correct about it being in a different dimension. Yeah, Discovery had its moments where it was all over the place but I had a firm grasp on it all. So I’m 99.9% sure he’s just out there on this one. 

Thanks, all! My father-in-law thinks Strange New Worlds is taking place in a parallel dimension?…"
startrek,"Daft question but it’s driving me insane, I got the blu ray of TOS the full journey but their doesn’t seem to be a play all function after each episode it goes back to the main menu screen. 

Does anyone know if their is a play all function and I’m just blind ? TOS Full Journey Blu Ray"
startrek,"In just a few episodes, and especially in ""Spock Amok,"" we've seen genuine friendships -- Pike and Spock, Una and La'an, Chapel and Ortegas and M'Benga -- done with a feeling of authenticity that I haven't gotten in Trek since Geordi and Data, Miles and Julian. You really get the sense that these characters both respect each other *and* enjoy each other's company. It's a side of real life that science fiction often gives short shrift, but it's so refreshing to see in it such abundance. SNW is doing genuine friendship spectacularly well."
startrek,"I was surprised by how much I loved this series but I think it's the best trek to come out in decades. Definitely the best since Enterprise ended and easily better than that show ever was.
So far my top three ranking is
 DS9, 
TNG

startrek,"My wife and I just recently watched the episode Galaxy's child. He's already so incredibly awkward and cringy up till that point but that episode has aged incredibly poorly.

He is such a terrible Incel speech to Leah Brahms. Then at the end *she* apologizes to *him* despite having done nothing wrong besides be married when he didn't know, and his violation of her privacy.

This was probably the most obvious example of ""Damn, this is men writing women badly"" I have ever seen in Trek Geordie is so cringy"
startrek,"The starship Enterprise uses deflector shields as it travels via impulse drive, which can attain speeds approaching, but under the speed of light, yet are governed to .25C to limit time dilation according to the Starfleet Technical Manual.  Assuming the Enterprise uses the smallest possible ovular impulse shield which will cover it’s frontal cross section of 463.73m by 195.28m, the shield will have a frontal surface area of 72,445m^2.  For travel in interstellar space, the interstellar medium averages roughly 1 Hydrogen atom per cubic centimeter, which makes a convenient 6.022x10^23 cm^3 of space per gram of free floating hydrogen.  Were the Enterprise to travel at full impulse in interstellar space, the deflector shields would have to account for 9.0x10^-6g of H per second.  Let’s move into the solar system, where the Enterprise will be forced to slog through the soup of solar wind.  According to spaceweather.com, readings of solar wind as high as 100 protons/cm^3 are not unheard of and are the figure we will use for calculating density of solar wind as the shields need to be able to handle all situations.  The Enterprise would encounter 8.99x10^-4g of protons from solar wind per second which would require only one ten thousandth of a watt of energy to move out of the way of the Enterprise as it barrels through at .25C.  However the technology of the shield around the Enterprise in unclear, and it is more fun to imagine that the matter in the way of the ship is simply annihilated.  As the ship destroys 8.99x10^-4g of protons per second moving at full impulse through the solar system, the annihilation of mass would yield nearly 81 Mjoules of energy per second, which could also be phrased as over 100 million horsepower, or the equivalent of 19.3 tons of TNT detonating every second.  If for some reason the Enterprise were to blast through the solar system at a speed of warp 9.975 (which in Voyager is disclosed to be 70 KLY in 75 years, and works out to very nearly 10,000 times the speed of light) the ship would encounter 3.6g of protons/second and release the equivalent of roughly 3.5 Fat Man atomic weapons, or 77 kilotons of energy per second as it blasts through the solar wind.  That or the ship could expend the 0.4 watts necessary to move the protons out of the way, but that’s not very fun.  I suppose the lesson here is that space is very empty but also very exciting! Found this in my email from 2015 about shields on the Enterprise. Curious how accurate these numbers are."
startrek,"So i am a bit overwhelmed with the chronological order in which to watch Star Trek. I have almost finished Enterprise and i believe discovery is next up. 

Is there a 2022 updated version of what to watch in chronological order? So many new treks seem to be on the horizon none of the lists i can find on google include the 2022 releases. Any info to steer me in the right direction would be amazing.  

Cheers. Chronological confusion"
startrek,"I recently started re-watching DS9 from the beginning. This is the first I have seen of it since I watched it in its original network broadcast. As soon as I started the first episode, I noticed how ""primitive"" it looked compared to the TV I watch every day - I watch all my network &amp; cable shows in HD, and DS9 certainly looked ""90s"" in comparison.

However, now that I am several episodes into season 2, I notice that it looks ""normal"", i.e., just fine, just like everything I watch daily, and waaaay better than the crappy quality of S1E1.

So I guess I'm just asking....what happened ? It certainly wasn't that I ""got used to it"". I went back and checked just now, and S1E1 still looks crappy (yes, I know ""crappy"" is not very precise, but w/e).

No, this is not a troll, more me just thinking out loud and wondering what the answer is to the significant improvement of the picture quality of S2 vs. S1. Thanks !!!! DS9 resolution ?"
startrek,"It's not a serious theory, but I like to think that Riker suddenly has a beard in season two of TNG because he was killed and replaced by his Mirror Universe counterpart.

What's your personal fan theory? Your Personal Fan Theory"
startrek,"I’m not sure if this was intentional or how it was when it originally aired, but I recently started watching The Original Series on Paramount+ and it seems like the title sequence in season 2 has Kirk’s voice over track swapped with the vocal track for the theme song. His voice is so quiet that I can barely hear it over the music and then the singing comes in full force. Anyone else notice this? TOS Title Sequence VO"
startrek,"I think Sisko would have dealt with the Kazon pretty quickly, then demand the Caretaker send them back. Picard probably would do something similar, or maybe got Data to work out how to get them back. How well do you think the Enterprise D/E or the Defiant would have coped in the Delta Quadrant?"
startrek,"Back in the day when i was rewatching ds9 i calculated the festival will be on 7 june in 2022 using the stardate calculator, with hopes i did that correctly Peldor Joi to everyone! Peldor Festival"
startrek,"Captain Picard says he will escort the Romulan vessel back to the neutral zone. The next scene shows the Romulan Ship and Enterprise leaving in different directions, obviously not escorting the Romulans. [Continuity Error] At the end of ""The Enemy"" (TNG S3E7)"
startrek,"Just finished re-watching them all again. Season 3 and 4 start to fall apart but I still enjoy them, just wish it ended stronger. I absolutely love Season 1 and 2 AND the opening theme song. Second best Star Trek next to TNG. Such great characters and the sense of adventure and discovery is fantastic.  
  &amp;nbsp;


It's been a long time... I love Star Trek Enterprise"
startrek,"Would be something new for the franchise, having a show focusing on a crew of a colony ship.

Early 22nd century making the most sense, when humans didn't have warp drives beyond warp 2.

With the slower speed, much of the adventure would be about the Journey, not just setting up and surviving on a new world.

Is this franchise ready for a live action series not about a Starfleet crew?

What are you opinion on this matter?  Is a series about space settlers a good idea? Would about Star Trek: Colony?"
startrek,I know it's hard to represent that idea in a pictogram but I don't see how the current symbol relates. How do the geometric shapes of the IDIC symbol relate to the concept?

startrek,"I want to show a friend DS9 but feel like some context (they haven’t seen anything) from at least TNG would be necessary. But don’t really have time for the whole series..
Looking for like 10 or so episodes to get into trek in general, and any good eps that set the scene for stuff like Bajoran culture and the Cardassian invasion, Trills, Q, Maybe some Borg stuff so the pilot has context. 
What do you think? And most importantly, what episode first? Fast track to DS9"
startrek,"So ignoring the logical conflict in the title. Let's say you were given the ability to change one **minor** thing in all of Star Trek, in every series, that has bugged you as a fan. Whether it's due to an all powerful being giving you one wish, using a \[benevolent\] AI to retcon every copy of every series in every media format, or using time travel (always that damned time travel) to make yourself the Continuity Czar for one thing on the show, you have the ability and authority to do it.

I'm not talking about anything major (like erasing an episode or even an entire series, as much as you might want to). Just some nitpicky thing that's always bugged you that you would fix if you could.

A few examples off the top of my head:

* Make warp speeds and travel times consistent. Changing the warp scale between generations is fine as long as it is maintained.
* Make Starfleet as diverse as the Federation's membership. There may be reasons why there are a lot of humans in Starfleet, but other races should be better represented in the shows.
* Diverse Starfleet, part 2: Starship names should also be more diverse. We've seen, what, a handful of Vulcan ship names, an Andorian or two, one Ferengi, and a whooooole lot of Earth names.
* Stardates...don't...make...sense. They will now!
* Non-human appearances should be more consistent. To use the elephant in the room as an example. Whether Klingons look like those from TOS, the movie/TNG era, the JJverse, or NuTrek is a matter of fan preference, but stick with one unless there is a story reason otherwise.

What little thing would you change? :) Q appears before you and lets you change one MINOR thing about Star Trek that's always bugged you. What do you choose?"
startrek,"So, we have the Picard manouver, the Riker manouver, the Janeway manouver (coffee first, then lets punch trough these alien's sacred/restricted/infested space).
So, what is the Kirk manouver? The Kirk manouver?"

Strange New Worlds (Optional), Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok (Suggested), Amok Time (Suggested), The Naked Time, The Cage, Strange New Worlds (Suggested)

## Intro

A little while ago I made a post about the [Star Trek Machete Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/elut9p/a_new_way_to_introduce_newcomers_to_star_trek_the/). You can go read it if you want, but I'll reexplain everything here so you don't have to.

Let me start off by saying that Ghosts of Illyria and Spock Amok are now two of my most favorite Star Trek episodes ever, definitely in the top 10. It may be a little early to declare something like that, but I feel there is something special about those two episodes that I will explain below. Before I get to that though, here is a quick re-primer on the Machete Order. 

## The Star Wars Machete Order 

The tl;dr for Machete Order is that it was invented as a way to introduce new fans to Star Wars after the prequel trilogy was released. The problem is that there were two ways to watch Star Wars, Chronological Order (1,2,3,4,5,6) and Release Order (4,5,6,1,2,3). Both methods had issues that are explained in my original post, but the tl;dr is that Chronological Order spoils the big twist in Empire Strikes Back early and Release Order has a dark ending. So there was a fan who created Machete Order (4,5,1,2,3,6) which solves both problems in one go and is, in my opinion, a very good way to introduce people to Star Wars.

## The Star Trek Machete Order Problem

Now there has been a LOT of opinion on how to introduce someone to Star Trek. Everyone has their own method that they feel strongly about and if you want to read some of the suggestions, go ahead and browse the comment section of my original post. But ultimately, the problem boils down to this: Star Trek requires an extra step.

The main issue is that unlike Star Wars, Star Trek often has very rocky starts. TOS season 1, while good, is not as good as season 2. TNG season 1 is widely considered to be the worst season 1 in all of Star Trek. Yet, TNG as a whole is easily the most popular Star Trek series ever. Even my original introduction order came with problems. I wanted to start at the most accessible Star Trek movie, The Voyage Home, but The Voyage Home has MAJOR spoilers for the whole series. Even one of the suggested variants of starting at The Wrath of Khan has issues; although I admit, I think this is a better solution than the one I came up with. But it all boils down to one central problem: Star Wars can always start with A New Hope; Star Trek cannot *easily* start with The Cage, or The Voyage Home, or Wrath of Khan or even Encounter At Farpoint. No matter where you try to start, there will always be some sort of problem you have to deal with.

## The New Star Trek Machete Order

Strange New Worlds (Optional), Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok (Suggested), Amok Time (Suggested), The Naked Time, The Cage, Strange New Worlds (Suggested)

Ghosts of Illeria is easily one of my favorite episodes of all time now. Not because it was a really good episode, which it was; but because at its core, it is the SAME episode as The Naked Time. The away team brings back a virus that nearly destroys the Enterprise. It is a premise so universal that nearly every Star Trek series has an episode like it: The Naked Time, The Naked Now, Babel, Macrocosm, Strange New World/Observer Effect. What's really great is that most of these episodes come early in the series before the characters are really established. The premise is THAT good. 

After Ghosts of Illeria comes Spock Amok, an excellent throwback to Amok Time. We get to see Spock interacting directly with T'Pring (technically a canon violation, but I personally think they made the right decision on that one). We also see Spock dealing with his own inner turmoil over his half-vulcan/half-human heritage, a big theme present in Amok Time as well. But Spock Amok does something else really great: it sets up the Spock/Chapel relationship; a subplot most prominient in the two TOS episodes The Naked Time and Amok Time. 

So when you take these four episodes together, Ghosts of Illeria, Spock Amok, Amok Time, and The Naked Time, you end up with the perfect connection point for introducing someone to the very start of all of Star Trek: Spock Amok/Amok Time. After that, you work your way backwards. Since you just saw the new version of the classic Star Trek contagion episode, Ghosts of Illeria, how about seeing the very first one, The Naked Time. And then how about seeing where it all began with Captain Pike, Number One and the Enterprise: The Cage. If you're pressed for time, you can even skip Spock Amok and Amok time and go straight to Ghosts of Illeria/The Naked Time.

## Where To Go From Here?

You may have noticed that Strange New Worlds is in two places, one is optional and one is suggested. This is because I think that Strange New Worlds should come AFTER The Cage, not before. The obvious question to ask after taking someone through these episodes is ""what do you watch next?"" my suggestion?

Whatever you want.

Seriously, whatever you want. Do you like TNG better? Go watch TNG. Does the person prefer the Original Series to the new one? Go watch the Original Series. Or maybe they liked the more modern feel of Strange New Worlds. In that case, go watch Strange New Worlds (the episode) after The Cage. That's the true beauty of the New Star Trek Machete Order, in six episodes you have given someone a taste of the best of what Star Trek has to offer; and as a bonus we were able to go back to the very beginning to do it. 

So that is why Ghosts of Illeria and Spock Amok are in my top ten favorite episodes, they serve as the perfect connection point for introducing all of Star Trek. 

Lastly, I'll conclude by saying that I'm glad Strange New Worlds is taking the direction that it is; one hand in the old, one hand in the new. In my opinion, it is the perfect time to introduce someone new to Star Trek because now we can all enjoy Star Trek from the very start once again, old fans and new fans alike.

startrek,"Forgive me for not including screenshots (Paramount won't let me on mobile).

In ""Spock Amok"", during Spock's initial log, we see Enterprise docked at Starbase 1, and we see another Constitution class come in to view, docking in the background.

Later in Starbase 1's conference room scenes, there is a table with two Constitution class ship models on it (one on a slightly higher pedestal than the other).

Any theories on what this other ship could be? We know from TOS that there were at least 12 of them. The show seems to want to introduce the concept of another ship that looks just like the Enterprise. But to what end?

Remember in one of the trailers to the show, there is a scene of a wrecked Constitution class ship on a planet. Initially, I might have thought this was going to be the result of some temporal shenanigans that the crew would have to undo, but now I'm thinking this might be another ship, and SNW is subtly sowing those seeds now. What do you think? Strange New Worlds foreshadowing another Constitution class"

startrek,"This post is inspired by an earlier one also dealing with the Q/El-Aurian war. 


In Picard S2 Guinan refuses to call the Q Gods. She instead uses the word Denizen. A word I'd never heard of before, so I googled it. It seems to be more of a legal distinction than one developed for normal day to day conversation, so excuse me if my definition isn't 1,000% accurate, but it is accurate enough for the point I need to make.. From what I can tell Denizens are people who aren't required to necessarily be citizens of a place, but are there so often that they are granted certain rights by a place.This would imply that the Q aren't born of the continuum. They just live there. They're granted powers from the continuum to protect it.

If we think about what Quinn said about the Q in Voyager. They're not God's nor are they Omnipotent. 

....""As the Q have evolved, we've sacrificed many things along the way, not just manners but mortality and a sense of purpose and a desire for change and a capacity to grow""....


What if the Q are able to bond to the continuum and receive their powers, but in doing so it rips them away from their life before they were a Q. No memories of a time before being a Q would lead someone to believe that they were always a Q. Freeing them from the Attachments of their specific universe, time-line, dimensions etc. Yet, the Q eventually forgot why they were entrusted with their powers. 

We know that El-Aurians are able to interact with the universe through sound and frequency. The listeners who are also able to know when time has been altered and are able to feel with something is different with people. What if the El-Aurians are able to take these abilities and sever the Q's connection to the continuum for short amounts of time. Stripping them of their powers and immortality. Therefore putting them on a equal playing field, or rather, an equal battlefield. Q vs El-Aurians"

startrek,"Going through a TNG rewatch and had to hop over to Prime to stream this episode. At first I though there might be some sort of weird racist moment or something that caused Paramount to pull the episode, but after watching it I’m stumped. It’s just a slightly above average season 2 episode with nothing particularly objectionable that I noticed. Is there some sort of weird rights issue? If so why is it available to stream elsewhere? Did some Paramount intern just forget to include this one episode with the upload bundle? Seems fishy. Why is TNG S02E21 (“Peak Performance”) missing from Paramount+?"

startrek,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit and I'm only making this because I'm frustrated that I cannot find a short film about Lego Star Trek I remember seeing it maybe a year ago on YouTube it was at the tail end of Star Trek 2009 and it was an alternate reality short film with the starship flies into the black hole and on the other side came out as entirely Lego I remember being extremely well done and really high-quality up to the quality of The Lego movie so no small short film. Quite funny as well poking holes in JJ Abrams style of filmmaking but alas I cannot find it on the Internet anywhere and that is why I'm making this Reddit posts, I believe it is a marketing company put this together maybe Lego themselves and have since taken it down I would really like to get my hands on a copy of it even though it was only maybe 5 to 8 minutes long it was still really well done. !!HELP!!

startrek,"By now probably most Trekkies have come into contact with this notion of ""Modern Trek"" through CBS/Amazon series like Discovery and Picard. I for one don't particularly hate them, but at the same time I simply do not enjoy them as much as TNG, which continues to give me great pleasure even during the 17th or so rewatch.

Now there are already a lot of good ideas and arguments out there on why this happens. I tend to agree with a lot of what has already been said, and I openly admit to a certain nostalgia when it comes to the role that Next Generation plays in my own life. But watching the recent second season of Picard I couldn't help but wonder what else there could be about it. And that's when this quote of Gene Roddenberry struck me:

&gt;The starship Enterprise is not a collection of motion picture sets or a model used in visual effects. It is a very real vehicle; one designed for storytelling  
&gt;  
&gt;(Introduction of *Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual* by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda)

This summarizes quite nicely what I believe to be a central aspect of Classic Trek: First, there was a story to be told. Which problem should be approached? Which relationship should be explored? What is the lesson that audiences can take away from this tale? A bit later on, there were even conflicts to be carried out and resolved. The story was then made accessible through the familiar crew of the Enterprise acting it out, and it was made exciting and fascinating by virtue of space exploration and future technology.

But phasers and bat'leths were never about phasers and bat'leths per se, they were about giving depth and credibility to an overarching vision of a peaceful and enlightened society who get in touch with other species to discuss (and sometimes fight about) their views and explore other viewpoints. It was like finding fitting characters for a pre-determined story. In the end, every single crew was but a set of puppets that the puppetmasters used to tell stories they could have just as well told by themselves; only that it was much more fun having a captain and first officer and ensign live through their adventure as conduit for some higher morale or interesting food for thought.

With New Trek, this entire notion has now been overthrown. The puppets were turned into the puppetmasters themselves, who try to play and interact with their in-universe surroundings to dig up more stories and adventures that only occasionally contain valuable lessons or insights. Nowadays, the characters are there first and the seasons are about coming up with stories that these characters might fit in. There are only a few key moments left which I genuinely enjoy and sometimes even admire, not because of their effect on the story or next week's plot twist, but for the value of the very real, emotional content.

For example, there's a scene where Picard talks to Renée in the second season of PIC. For what it's worth in terms of story continuity, I dislike this scene because I find it hardly credible that he could talk her into carrying on and moving forward after never ever having met her before. From that perspective, it feels like lazy writing to quickly wrap up the episode within 45 minutes and continue with whatever comes up next week. But if you know Jean-Luc Picard and if you know the role he has played during seven years of TNG, constantly standing up for his ideals and moral integrity while also being vulnerable as a person, you suddenly begin to realise how much truth lies in his words not for Renée or the series, but for the human condition and our daily lives right here and right now.

By the same token, there are a lot of small moments in the newer series that, when I watch them by themselves without thinking about any character arcs or canon lore, still deeply move me and sometimes can even teach me a lesson. But in the end, it's nothing compared to my all-time favorite TNG which as a whole continues to spend me comfort and warmth. Instead of laying the focus on a story that can be stretched out over several episodes, it lays the focus on valuable insights and lessons and wraps them into a story that is rather short and easier to grasp. For even in the darkest circumstances, it acts as a light -- sometimes only a glimmer -- to find the way forward. My take on why 'Modern Trek' is different"

So what I am rambling about is that I starting thinking of watching Star Trek again but when I tried to think of episodes that are hopeful, or reaffirming, I drew a blank. So I am hoping to for reminders and recommendations of such. I don't want escapism as such, or easy watch episodes per say: just good episodes that are hopeful, even if the characters have to deal with difficult decisions or situations.

Bicentennial Man is a 1999 movie about an android named Andrew who learns, grows and wishes to be human, which is quite similar to Data. In one scene, Andrew is visiting Portia, she lives in Apartment B4.

Since Bicentennial Man came out in 1999 and Nemesis came out in 2002, is that a coincidence that Nemesis would have Data's brother be named B4 or is B4 connected to Isaac Asimov and is a homage to him? Did the name B4 come from Bicentennial Man?"

startrek,"Looking at the built up of the season and all the theories that were thrown around regarding the origins and nature of the DMA and its creators, I was surprised by the nature of the finale. Just everything about the finale and the season as a whole felt very different from the usual Trek recipe for season ending. Discovery Season 4 Finale"
startrek,"I was curious as to why in “the mind’s eye” data did not attend the artificial intelligence seminar with Geordi. I get that he has his duties and stuff, but it seems like an artificial intelligence seminar is something  that Data would be a benefit at. I guess if he went with Geordi the whole episode would have been ruined. Is there a reason why Data didn’t go too? The minds eye"
startrek,Probably not. But I wanted to ask the question. Will 26-24 or maybe 16 episode format come (back) to Star Trek?
startrek,Spock Amok (SNW Ep 5) had me laughing out loud! Oh man is this series good. I really look forward to its future. What good Star Trek this is! I haven't laughed that much in a while...
startrek,"Did anyone else get goose bumps in episode 5 when Spock said ""In Starfleet, I am accepted for who I am. Half-Vulcan, Half-human. I am... quite simply, Spock.""

I know it sounds kinda sad but when I was a kid in the 90s, I grew up in a rural English town where I experienced a lot of racism for many years until I finally got the hell out of there. Star Trek (mainly TNG, DS9, Voyager) was my escape, and gave me hope for a better future, where I would/could be accepted for who I was.

Anyway, that episode in general, and that line in particular, brought back a lot of memories for me and reminded me of one of the reasons I fell in love with Star Trek all those years ago. Spock quote in SNW episode 5"
startrek,"Steve Rogers was the best choice for Captain America because he was a good man.   The Red Skull was a villain, so the super soldier serum made him more of a villain.  As Erskine says, ""...So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen.""

Isnt that the real problem with genetic engineering?  Khan was a villain, with or without the juice. From Space Seed:  

KIRK: He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring.

SPOCK: ...Because the scientists overlooked one fact: superior ability breeds superior ambition.

I'm wondering if superior ambition was really part of the package or was that just the trait of the individuals selected for the augment trials?   Its likely the scientists looked for people with certain traits, like ambition, to further amplify the results of the engineering.

In DS9,  Doctor Bashir, I Presume:

O'BRIEN: You're not a fraud. I don't care what enhancements your parents may have had done. Genetic recoding can't give you ambition, or a personality, or compassion or any of the things that make a person truly human.

Later in that same episode:

BENNETT:For every Julian Bashir that can be created there's a Khan Singh waiting in the wings — a superhuman whose ambition and thirst for power have been enhanced along with his intellect. 

So Bashir didnt get heightened ambition in his augment package?  Or is he just the Steve Rogers to Khan's Red Skull?

The Federation has seemed to write it off as a solid fact that a side effect of augmenting is ambition.  But do they know that for certain?  After all, the Federation does use genetic engineering to correct birth defects and that doesnt seem to cause a race of ambitious babies bent on galactic dominion.

It seems likely the Eugenics Wars were so devastating that the Federation still uses this genetic engineering is bad fear mongering to keep it on the shelf. Genetic Ambition?"
startrek,I've only seen a little bit of the original Star Trek but I've watched the series prior to Enterprise. Were mind melds taboo then too or was that overcome by the years the original series took place in? It just seems like the other series have treated it like something serious and not to be taken lightly but perfectly ok to do so I was wondering when Vulcans changed on that Mind Melds in Enterprise
startrek,Going to be in LA in a couple of months and I’m considering taking a tour with him. Has anybody gone on a Trekland tour with Larry Nemecek? What did you think?
startrek,"I have to say, I had my doubts. But I was pleasantly surprised with the first episode of SNW. 
For me it comes down to whether the episode is rewatchable in a casual way. It's kind of Star Treks thing. TOS TNG DS9 VOY and even ENT all had episodes that could be skipped to without having to watch any previous episode. Discovery did not have this and Picard did not have this. This is why I haven't rewatched any episodes from those series. On the other hand Lower Decks and SNW got this formula just right. I had my doubts"
startrek,"Shatner made a big deal about pronouncing *sabotage* as ""saba-taajj"" but what about in ""The Alternative  Factor"" when he pronounces *prelude* as ""prell-yood"".

I myself would be super pumped to try Diplomath from *Lower Decks.* What's the weirdest Star Trek game you would play in real life?"
startrek,"In the Season 1 finale they are saved by the USS Titan (cooler than the Cerritos), commanded by Riker and Troi, coming in guns a blazing with the TNG theme playing. A massive blast of nostalgia saving the Cerritos, with the main cast mainly sitting around in awe. No explanation of how the Titan knew what was happening, but a cool moment of fan-service. 

But by Season 2 the Cerritos is the one performing the daring rescue of a nominally “better” ship. In fact the very captain they are saving is a fan service cameo from TNG (although not of the hight of Riker and Troi). And most of the episode is showing the hard work put into making the last minute rescue possible. The danger faced by the crew as they implement their technobabble solutions. 

These two finales compliment each other very well, showing the growth and increased self-assurance not only of the Cerritos Crew, but of the show itself. An interesting parallel I noticed in the Lower Decks Season Finales."

startrek,"I watch a lot of ST on my phone and I recently started downloading the episodes instead of streaming them due to wifi drops. Now every episode that's actually downloaded has an experience more like Netflix. Just press play and watch and go straight into the next episode. I went back and pressed play on an episode I no longer have downloaded and instantly got an ad while the downloaded episodes are still ad and CBS intro free.


Hopefully this is helpful for some people PSA: If you watch Star Trek using the Amazon Prime video app on your phone/tablet - download the episodes instead of just streaming them to remove ads and that annoying CBS intro"
startrek,"That is what empathy is all about, putting yourself in the other's shoes. The Katra swap was a perfect metaphor for the episode's main theme, which was Empathy. Brilliant writing. Symbolism of Spock and T'Pring switching bodies"
startrek,It's established in good this episode that the colony begins with the 48 surviving Defiant crew people. How is it possible that the population is 8000 after only 200 years? Is this just a weird oversight? DS9 question re: Children of Time (minimal spoiler)

startrek,"Yeah I know people hate the Kelvin timeline, but Into Darkness is a 2 hour long movie and ive only seen people comment about it's last 10 minutes. Maybe on rare occasion a mention of Pike's Death.

The 2009 movie and Beyond at least have some gifs spreaded and whatever but it's interesting how most of Into Darkness vanished.

I rewatched the first 30kin before posting this and bro this is just so weird no one talks about any of it because for some reason it just feels like action and almost doesn't have any of those Sci-fi stuff that Trek usually does so well.

I'm particularly fond of the 2009 movie, ngl, and because I'm a really new trekkie I enjoy the Kelvin tl, but I just find what happend to Into Darkess specifically do funny People decide to forget Into Darkness existem and I understand"
startrek,"And folks I am starting to think Garak is more than a plain, simple, tailor. Watching DS9 for the first time, just watched ""In the Pale Moonlight..."""
startrek,"In a crowded field with a lot of candidates, and nothing against Jolene Blalock (who I assume is #1 in many other fans' books), Gia Sandhu as T'Pring is just breathtaking to me. It may be the fact that Strange New Worlds also has a lot of money to lavish on costumes and makeup and lighting, and because filming itself has come some distance since Enterprise. I don't know. I just know that any time she's in a scene, time stops and I sort of forget to pay attention to what she's saying. Good job, casting! I'm Just Going To Call It: Gia Sandhu is the Most Beautiful Vulcan in Star Trek History"
startrek,"I loved SNW Ep 5, but one thing had me scratching my head. When Spock and T’Pring did the Katra thing and it went wrong, all the candles suddenly went out. Why? Vulcans are telepathic but there’s never been any reference to telekinesis.

Anybody have an in-universe explanation for that happening? Or was it just done for dramatic effect despite not making sense within Star Trek world? Why did the candles go out?"
startrek,"I know they've already filmed Picard S3 by now. But I'm watching season 3 of The Boys, and I've remembered how much Quaid actually looks like Boimler (sure they must have modelled him after his looks). They'd only have to put a bit of grey in his hair and he could convincingly be Boimler in his mid-40s during Picard. It'd be a lot of fun. I hope Jack Quaid makes a cameo as Commander/Captain Boimler in Picard S3"
startrek,"*Strange New Worlds* is the first *Star Trek* entry I've genuinely enjoyed since the final season of *Enterprise*.  Unfortunately, the series will always be held back by its completely unnecessary Prequel conceit.

None of the characters on this show bear any resemblance to the characters from the 1965 pilot.  They have the same names... and that's pretty much all they have in common.  The new versions are interesting in their own right, but they should've just been conceived as completely new characters.  It would at least liberate them from being forced into a predetermined fate of prequel characters.  


We already know how the Spock, T'Pring, and Chapel love triangle will turn out.  Any intrigue from that love triangle is gone.  We already know what is in store for Captain Christopher Pike and  Lt. James Kirk.  Even the state of the universe holds no surprises.  There's not much they can do with Klingons and Romulans because everything is nailed down by canon.

All these limitations are completely unnecessary.  I don't think people are watching this show because they wanted to see more of Captain Pike from 1965's *The Cage*.  They're watching because 2022 series is good, not because they liked the 1965 episode.  There was no good reason for this show to have been a prequel. 

The show should've just been about Captain Anson Mount of the NCC-1701F Enterprise, a direct sequel to TNG.  That would've opened the door for TONS of appearances from the Star Trek alumni from the TNG, DS9 and VOY era.  All of those actors are perfectly age-appropriate for a post-TNG series.  And frankly, more viewers would've been drawn in by the appearances of ""original"" actors of beloved characters (Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Bashir, Kira, Seven, and EMH) rather than ""new"" actors portraying beloved characters (Spock, Uhura). The Prequel conceit of SNW will unfortunately keep it from becoming truly great"
startrek,"Calling all internet sleuths: T’Pring gives Spock an engagement necklace in an incredible looking jewelry… pyramid? in ep 1 on SNW. The person who designed it posted a close up of it’s functionality on Instagram and I am obsessed—but I can’t seem to find it again…

Anyone have a lead??? Spock/T’Pring jewelry “box”"
startrek,"Hello everyone. 

I am writing an adventure for a Star Trek Tabletop Role-playing Game, the game will be about a crew coming together on some remote scrapping planet and finding a brand new spore drive powered federation ship after some goonesque adventure. 

This part of the adventure I have written up all ready to go, however I want this to be a game similar in theme to Andromeda, another Gene Roddenberry Sci-Fi show I love where by this rag tag crew find a larger galaxy without the federation. Without faster than light travel. And with their ship, a copy of the federation archives and hopefully a little bit of spark, they can reform and reignite the federation as they bound across the stars. 

I'd like to ask this rather large group of fellow Star Trek Nerds to contribute to my ""What If?"" And tell me what you'd expect to find in this Galaxy. 

The exact cause of the Omega War will be lost and won't be all that much explored. I'd imagine all enemies of the federation would have eventually joined and so any big bad races would be new and unique. 

I think there may be some artificial high tech way for FTL to happen in artificial roads of subspace but not sure about this.. ""What If?"" the federation fell after a Omega Particle based war."

Is season 4 worth watching or is it still just as bad?  

I tried looking up user reviews on rotten tomatoes and it is a cesspit with people accused of being homophobic and racist (from people who liked the show -go figure). Is Discovery season 4 worth watching?"
startrek,"TLDR:   Who doesn’t like hijinks?

The early 2000s saw a fairly severe turn in the tone of science fiction and fantasy.  SG1 was ending, Nolan released Batman Begins, Enterprise went all in on the Xindi ‘9/11’ story, BSG was rebooted by Ron Moore. Before anyone reaches for their pitchforks or lights a torch I loved every one of these shows or movies.  My purpose is not to be critical but to observe that that tonally things had transitioned to a trend of being dark and gritty.  Gone were the days of Christopher Reeve or Jack O’Neill.  

Two decades later we still have the Snider cuts, smoke monsters, and don’t even get me started on what happened on my other favorite sci fi franchise this week.  I never thought I would have to seriously censure what my three year old watches on Disney in a franchise that claims to be made for children.  

Someone on the Trek Reddit recently compared SNW to Ted Lasso and I want to give them credit.   My skills to find a source reference in Reddit are weak but whoever it was had a good point.  I think another good comparison is the tone (although not quite as goofy) of the Orville.  Yes- I am aware the Orville is heavily uh influenced by the TNG and TOS (and if that is a deal breaker for you see: DS9 and B5).  I am not being critical or comparing franchises.  

SNW in a nutshell isn’t a drag.  It’s not depressing.  Even the Gorn episode has moments of charm and levity that kept it from drowning into a self important epic mess.  Streaming SNW is like watching an episode of Cheers or MASH.  Excellent writing and performances without the heartburn.  You know there is a decent chance watching it will make you happy.  

In these times when just glancing at the news can make you sad or horrified I think entertainment like this is vital.  It is absolutely a favorite part of my week.  I hope we get six seasons and a movie. SNW is part of a much needed tonal shift."
startrek,"Maybe this would be a better fit for r/showerthoughts…

For anyone who decides to watch the different Trek series in chronological, rather than production, order Discovery jumping ~930 years into the future kind of negates any tension over the Borg, Cardassian, Romulan, or whatever other threat any other iteration of the show has faced. The only exception being ENT, since that show took place 200(?) ish years before Discovery. 

Disclaimer: I’m not a die-hard Trekkie. I don’t speak Klingon. I’m a fairly casual fan for whom galactic exploration is a pretty intense dream. I grew up with TNG-DS9-VOY and got back into it bingeing ENT during the pandemic, then deciding to go through the other series in chronological order BUT I didn’t have Paramount Plus at the time Possible discovery spoilers"

startrek,"Right before they fly the Enterprise into the accretion disk around the black hole in Episode 4, Spock says to Captain Pike ""...your plan requires flying the Enterprise into one of the most turbulent PHENOMENONS in space.""

As a Vulcan, with their most immaculate sense of logic, and their seemingly complete, articulate grasp on English grammar, I would think that Spock would know that the plural of ""phenomenon"" is ""phenomena"", not ""phenomenons.""

Hearing him say that set off my OCD/inner grammar Nazi last week, and I was reminded of it this evening on the ""previously on"" intro to this week's Episode 5.

I can't be the only person who noticed this...

P.S: I'm marking this as spoiler, only because it's quasi-related to the most recent episode. I'm having a hard time with something Spock says in SNW."
startrek,"I've been a fan of Star Trek since the days of watching TNG when I was a kid. As an adult I've watched through TNG, Voyager, and DS9 continuously.  I have great respect for TOS and for The Animated Series and I am even fond of Enterprise. I've been so desperate, as an adult, to be able to experience an episodic Star Trek series where I could look forward each week to the next episode to see what challenges the crew faced and watch the characters develop in real time. I have been heartbroken watching Discovery each season, slowly realizing that maybe the star trek of my youth was destined to be a relic of the past. I feel like SNW is the Star Trek series I've been waiting for all these years and I couldn't be more thrilled. Not only has every episode so far been fantastic but I feel like EP 5 might be one of my favorite trek episodes of all time. After spending years complaining about how there is no good Star Trek being made anymore, I just want to take the time to give credit where credit is due. SNW so far has been an absolute joy for this millennial trekky and I can't wait to learn more about this crew and see what adventures this series takes us on. SNW - S1:E5 might be one of the best trek episodes I've ever seen"

Rom cannot contact anyone on the Ferengi home world and he goes into ops and tells Sisko he is worried that the Dominion has invaded his home world. Think of all the terrible consequences for the Alpha Quadrant, he says.

And then, off screen, in an almost throw away line, you hear this from Worf: ""I cannot think of any."" 

I'm not sure what struck me about the moment or the comment, but it was just so laugh out loud perfect. All of Worf's best lines are a single, simple sentence. Anyway, just wanted to share this moment of zen. Worf's best line is actually in Deep Space Nine, I think?"

startrek,"Critics were supposedly given the first six episodes of Strange New Worlds ahead of the premiere. Most gave rave reviews (deservedly so), but those who didn't said it was because the second half of the episodes, particularly the last two, were incredibly awful and everything that people hate about NuTrek.

I've watched every episode of SNW. Last week's episode was the best IMO, but is one of the ""bad ones"" according to these critics. Meanwhile, today's was spectacular, classically light-hearted Trek episode. I certainly can't think of anything NuTrek that was like it, let alone the parts of NuTrek people complain about.

A big part of me is hoping these were indeed the episodes the critics were given, because if this week was an indication of ""incredibly awful,"" I'm super stoked for the second half of the season! Were the six SNW pre-screening episodes given to critics the first six or just random ones?"
startrek,In my opinion one big yes!! He just gives better Spock vibe for me. I feel like he better portrays colliding sides of being half human and half Vulcan. Is Ethan Peck better Spock then Zachary Quinto?
startrek,"I really loved every storyline within the episode. I loved how they humanized both Una and La'an, that interrogation scene was hilarious. I loved the diplomatic negotiations too, I love how they bring in the new aliens with the different characteristics and explore their perspectives in every episode. SNW truly feels like the modernized TOS. 

Every character becomes more and more lovable and likeable!

My favorite parts, however, intrigue me and confuse me a bit at the same time. 

First things first, our girl Chapel is officially a bisexual hoe (good for her)! What I loved the most was Chapel and Spock's dynamic and chemistry. The way Christine validated Spock's Vulkanness and Humanity was so endearing and Spock getting irritated at and punching that dude who insulted Chapel was fun to watch as well. So, there is definitely a special friendship and understanding being formed between the two. 

And yet, I wouldn't say they are a case of relationship I would be satisfied to see remain purely platonic, because it isn't from Chapel's perspective, she definitely has a crush on Spock already and we know she is going to have this yearning for him throughout, like, the decades. 

Chapel looks at Spock kind of longingly throughout the episode and don't get me wrong, I love sad romance, but I wonder how it is going to work out considering how the things ended between Spock and T'pring (who is also an interesting character) in the episode? Though, I think it becomes clear why Spock and T'pring broke up eventually, neither could give the other what they truly needed.

I want Strange New Worlds to flesh out Chapel's attraction and attachment to Spock and their friendship and also, explore Chapel's backstory which is hinted to be traumatic I think. Spock Amok was amazing, the whole crew is cute af!"

I'm going to combine the best of what I feel that all the bridges had to offer. However, I've always wondered how the quadrants got named. I'm going to explain it like this. USS Voyager among other ships gets launched into the Delta quadrant. Which I have to believe that the quadrants were assigned by the first leaders of the Federation. So if they were assigned by the leaders of the Federation, how can all the species in the Delta quadrant refer to it as the Delta quadrant? I mean even the Borg refer to it as such. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and so on are terms from here on Earth. Hell even the Omega Particle is referred to by species residing in the Delta Quadrant. They even reference time like we do. Maybe I'm over thinking and overreaching it but I've got questions! I would love to start a debate about this. What are your thoughts? Quadrant Quandary"

Did the writers just forget that Dr. M'Binga's daughter is in the transporter buffer? Which was just established in the previous episode. If so it means the writers put something in one episode and immediately forgot it in the next. That's gotta be a record. Wow that's got to be a record of how fast the writers have forgotten something!"
startrek,"I’ve watched Star Trek when I was younger, and I’ve always been a big fan of all aspects of the show, and I think most people agree the biggest parts of these showed are 1: The sci-fi elements, and 2: the personal connections and bonds between characters. 

I feel like discovery’s connection moments are kinda lazy? I didn’t notice it until season 3, but every scene plays out the same way and it just feels lazy, and kinda forced. Characters look at each other in this weird way, and take like 20 seconds in between sentences. It’s not unbearable, but it happens in almost every episode, and I’m honestly kinda sick of it. 

Yes I understand that they have all been though a traumatic experience jumping 900 years into the future find the federation in shambles, but it’s gotten to the point where these connection moments seem like lazy excuses to push the plot forward. 

I feel like part of the problem also has to do with not only the way that way that discoveries plot is laid out (similar to Picard with larger stories in one season instead of smaller ones per episode), but also the way that the characters are written. Maybe it’s just me but I honestly can only remember four of the characters names from the main cast. Being so unfamiliar with characters, watching them having personal moments doesn’t really make me feel anything if I don’t know the characters motives and inspiration. Something that’s always bothered me about discovery"
startrek,"Hi everyone!

I'm having trouble finding this answer online. Since Star Trek The Original Series got pulled from everything to be put on Paramount Plus I've had a hard time tracking down where to watch the Original Series with the original effects. Not the remastered version.

Is the Original Series only available as the Remastered version on Paramount Plus? Do I have to break down and buy it physically? Amazon used to have it as the Original Series ""Classic"".

Thanks! Where to watch Star Trek Original Series with the original effects?"

startrek,"I’ve been watching a lot of episodes as of late and I’ve noticed repeated references to Deck 22. Voyager, Discovery, New Worlds (as I’m sure others as well) Is there any significance to this? Some inside joke or reference by the writers? I’ve extensively googled this and dug through forums but come up short. Any hard core fans out there that know why this deck is constantly referenced (iirc it’s usually had some sort of catastrophic event like a hill breach). Deck 22"

startrek,"I was so tense watching this episode, as a new Star Trek fan, this by far was my favorite episode from what I've been watching so far from ST universe (i have only watched SNW so far tho haha)

Every scene (most of them) of this episode was so intense/thrilling, i was terrified over the Gorns, this is my first 'encounter' with them watching star trek and even tho i didn't see them, i was still scared of them. Seeing how the crew preferred to escape and get away from them, shows how terrifying these creatures are. 

This episode showed me that Star Trek can be very dark too...

I LOVED how Pike was so tense and still managed to give instructions, maintain composure, under a lot of pressure and people dying in his ship.. the terror the crew had i was feeling it too. 

This episode was a 10/10 for me. Finished episode 4 of SNW and.."
startrek,"Just want to take a minute to say how absolutely incredible DS9 is. Every character is written and acted so beautifully. The bonds and relationships built between characters are so deep and heartfelt. Worf’s relationship with Jadzia and subsequent relationship with Ezri, the way Kira and Odo’s relationship evolves and how they mutually and individually grow, the way they show affection between Benjamin and Jake, the love/hate dynamic of Odo and Quark, even the insane story arc of Gul Dukat is incredible. The juxtaposition of religion and science, the ethics of war, and the pushing of the progressive envelope seriously just make DS9 stand out so much more than any other Trek DS9 appreciation post"
startrek,"I recently started ds9, which until now I've very much disliked (don't worry, I now see the error of my ways.) I have come to the realization that he just might just be my favourite character. He is so well written and the show shockingly makes me really feel for the guy. Anytime he's on screen I am wrapped up in the story. I find any episodes about him so interesting and well done. Anyone else think he's a great character, or does anyone think the opposite? I think Garek is my favourite character."
startrek,"I've been working on recreations of the TNG Helm/Operations consoles for a while, and it just occurred to me to check out Encounter at Farpoint, figuring that the usual graphics would be reversed. I was curious about whether or not they simply flipped or rebuilt the graphic layers.

Much to my surprise - they did neither! I found a clip of Q's first appearance and as Data and Torres snap to their feet, you can clearly see the LCARS are in their usual spots, only the officers have switched positions. Confirmation when Picard is rebuking Yar, you get a clear shot of the consoles behind Picard and the left console clearly only has one D-Pad, meaning it's the Ops graphic.

I'd always figured that the Farpoint arrangement was the intended positions but they decided to flip it based on camera angles or something (like trying to get Picard &amp; Riker in the same shot as Data) but now I'm curious why Data and Torres were sitting where they were for this ep. Oddity about Encounter At Farpoint's LCARS"

startrek,"It's a fairly long list if you include voiceover, but who count if you're only including live action? A few I can think of include Deep Roy, Greg Grunberg, Simon Pegg... What actors have been in both live action Star Trek and Star Wars?"
startrek,"I've come up with the first character for a fanfic story based around the crew of the USS Sojourner, a half-Cardassian woman by the name of Iarot Taggert who serves as a lieutenant commander in engineering.  


Her mother is a Cardassian woman by the name of Tieko Khaddal who married a Starfleet engineer from Sydney named Malcom Taggert who was helping restore infrastructure destroyed by the Dominion. Iarot was born and raised in Australia, the climate of which her mother very quickly became comfortable with and she even avoided some of the health problems Cardassian women face while pregnant. Tieko worked at the consulate for the new Cardassian state in the city, as the the one in San Fransisco was not fully built yet. Her father worked at the Utopia Fleet Yards.  


Although Iarot didn't have a tightly controlled childhood, she still underwent the mental training Cardassian children usually undergo, something that her father Malcolm was in full support of. Iarot's paternal grandmother Deborah Taggert was a malignant narcissist who frequently mentally and emotionally abused her children. The experience made her father see the training as something that could make her much more resilient in the face of someone trying to manipulate her. 

This idea was proven to be accurate during Iarot's only meeting with her paternal grandmother which ended when Deborah told Malcolm to 'get your forked tongue freak of a daughter' out of her sight. This also helped her greatly with her studies at Starfleet Academy as well as an occasion where a Ferengi was trying to gaslight her into thinking she was misremembering overhearing him talk to his superior about some gems he'd stolen.  


The other trait Iarot displayed that was typical of Cardassian children was showing up at her parent's workplaces unexpectedly to see what they did. Malcolm would later go on to say that the closest he ever came to a heart attack was opening a Jeffries tube to see her staring back at him. While he would recognize that this behavior meant she loved him, he was insist she stay out of more sensitive areas. Teiko also made it clear to her that while heated bickering would be considered courtship behavior on Cardassia it wouldn't be seen as such by other cultures. Malcolm elaborated on this by  telling her that he got into an argument with Teiko during a walk in the park when they first began dating. Teiko got flustered by how quickly Malcolm became argumentative and asked him if it was usual for humans to be so lewd in public.  


Iarot decided to pursue an engineering career after hearing about the rebuilding efforts on Cardassia Prime and her father's role in them. The challenges Starfleet's engineers faced and their methods of overcoming them captured her imagination from a young age, to say nothing of the fact that Starfleet would go so far to rebuild the home-world of a species they were just at war with. She does not have anything approaching disdain for her Cardassian heritage, although her mother had no reservations telling her about the Union's crimes against the Bajorans and other groups. She has a fairly warm relationship with her family on Cardassia Prime even if she has difficulty relating to them at times.  


In terms of personality, Iarot is fairly open and maintains a decently sized social circle largely made up of her fellow Sojourner crewmates as well as cadets she befriended at the academy. She also has both her mother's sarcasm and her father's love of practical jokes which she often applies to her engineering skills to. On one occasion when a particularly disliked Starfleet commodore came aboard and began irritating the crew, she got into contact with former academy classmates who had the misfortune of dealing with him, figured out his food preferences, and reprogrammed his replicator to only give him what he absolutely hated. When he moved quarters, she moved the 'hack' to the replicator in his new room.

An ending where Picard rescues the couple from the holodeck after the subterfuge only to tell Morality ""you think you're best than me in my ship?"" would be more satisfactory to everyone. But no, they just coded a makeshift Elite Dangerous into some Raspberry py server in all that time pressure from the protostar thing and leave it be?. I'm so mad about this conclusion... 

So, I researched...  
Moriarty was a Jackass, but he was trying to survive in a certain manner.

startrek,"Discovery, and maybe Picard, inflicted what seems to be permanent damage to Trekkers. I've been watching and reading reviews of the SNW episodes so far and it really pains me.

People are complaining about things as if they never happened before in the franchise. Some of the most ridiculous I've seen so far:

- Starfleet officers going undercover to a new planet
- Starfleet rules not being followed by the book
- Super genius officers getting things done quickly
- Hostile aliens coming out of nowhere
- Bridge officers questioning some captain's orders
- Too much technology compared to TOS (lol)
- The cast is too diverse (really) 

I am absolutely certain people would love SNW if Discovery never existed. But since it does, I'm seeing some people forgot what Star Trek is in order to defend themselves from the ""awfulness"" of NuTrek, and now these same people are dreaming of a Trek that have never existed.

startrek,"I watched episode 1 of Strange New Worlds and i didn't know that i would have been so emotional and hyped with Star Trek in my life. 

Episode 1 of SNW felt like showing me light bulb, discovering what could become my new favorite piece of content for years to come. It felt like a movie, but a really good one, i felt like a child again discovering something new and amazing in front of my eyes.

I've been a fan lf Star Wars my entire life cause i love the sci fi and rarity of new worlds and journey on the galaxy.. The ships, unique technology and futuristic aspect of it. The rarity of seeing new species and knowing that there's a whole galaxy to explore alongside new characters and discover everything around it.. 

But Star Trek felt different, it felt like it was something i was looking for a long long time, a normal tv show/movie, about a crew that have for mission the discovery and exploration of new planets and stars, and everything in it. The personalities and characteristics of that crew and the technology surrounding them. The plot and base storytelling is not confusing or heavy (meaning i can watch it without paying that much attention like i do with star wars or The Expanse), i can just relax and enjoy it without thinking that much, that's why i love episodic tv shows so much and i can see that Star Trek have a lot of those.

The message this first episode had, is better than any other message that any other tv show have shown me in recent years, it even made me think and that could even change people's mind on how to prevent violence and instead have a mentality of unity despite the differences. 

I already love the crew, the girl with white hair, the nurse/doctor (don't remember her name haha) is already my favorite character of the crew. I like the other ones too, but that one caught my attention. She reminds me of Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter.. 

I don't know if Star Trek (the older series and early content) is like that or better, but im confident that i will be all month and what is left of the year, watching Star Trek content (movies, tv shows, animation, etc)

Im glad im still able to be in the same age of the existence of Star Trek, and now that technology (CGI, etc) is better, cinematography has evolved, and every episode could feel like a movie, i have high hopes in what is to come for Star Trek. I just fell in love with Star Trek"
startrek,"Hey, Trekkies and Trekkers!  


I know that most of you probably have Star Trek : The Next Generation on DVD. I recently purchased the 2020 release because my fiancee is very into it now, after watching it on BBC America. Problem is - the quality is absolutely terrible in comparison to the TV broadcast, enough that she asked me if these were bootleg DVDs. So I looked into it. Here's a screenshot, as well as some pics of the set :  


[https://imgur.com/a/T1TRN6B](https://imgur.com/a/T1TRN6B)  


Turns out that Trek bootlegs are prolific and hard to distinguish, with more than a few blog posts describing how to tell the bootleg Voyager and DS( boots out there, but none about TNG. I'm asking what your 2020 DVD releases look like, as I cannot seem to find a reliable comparison. I understand that the 2017 release set included a holographic cover and 3 boxes of varying sizes; my set includes two fat boxes instead and a matte cover, and I don't know if that's just a revised set, or mine is genuinely wrong. They also have that very distinct DVD-R smell to them, but I just can't tell.  


Any advice? I'm just amazed that the picture quality is so bad!  


Thank you! Will the real DVDs please stand up?"

You know, something based on actual history instead of just stereotypes about greedy people.

The only problem is that making America or the British into major villain so explicitly would probably have been too spicy for Star Trek.

I still like the Ferengi we got as a a great source of comic relief, and the feminism stuff was interesting but they had potential to be real villains. The reason Ferengi flopped as TNG villains was how highly sanitized they were."
startrek,"I’ve been reflecting on the (deserved!) praise for Strange New Worlds and its faithful update to the TOS Enterprise bridge, and it got me thinking about the bridges that would need the *least* updating if a new, modern-day show were set upon it. The bridge that has aged the most gracefully since it first appeared onscreen, if you will. 

For me, the clear winner would be the Enterprise bridge from ST VI: The Undiscovered Country. Even though that bridge is more than 30 years old in our time, to me it still looks plausibly “future” without being obviously “the future as the 1990s imagined it,” unlike how the Starfleet bridges from ST:TMP through ST:III clearly show their ‘70s sci-fi influence today. 

I don’t have a clear opinion on which bridge has aged the *worst* since airing, though. Which starship bridge has aged the best (and worst)?"

startrek,"I really like Lower Decks.  It is a fun and enjoyable half hour that goes by quickly and gives me a quick Trek-fix.  But it has made me think that perhaps I'd prefer shorter live action Treks in general too.  Sometimes an hour-long Trek seems like a slog with lots of filler that are develop the characters at the expense of really slowing down the plotline.  Lower Decks tells a story and builds character timelines all within a half hour format.  I like it.  What did you think of the Short Treks that Discovery put out a while back?  Should they produce more of them?  Or should there be a half-hour series just like Lower Decks but live action, well-written, concise and easy to digest? Should there be a half-hour Trek show?"

Is there a way that a person can let the people in charge know that I think they're doing a great job, like an official forum or something?

startrek,Working on my Trekie badge by watching everything Startrek. Found Voyager to be a bit of an uphill battle. Weaker characters and general lacklustre writing/themes. Most series take a while to find their feet - but feels like Voyager takes till season 4 where they replace Kes w 7 of 9 for things to come to life a bit more.

Is that the only reason people consider the Gorn in SNW to be a retcon? It's not exactly much of a stretch for all the contradictions to come down to a simple matter of the Federation not having seen one specific ship class before. Why do people consider the Gorn showing up in SNW to be a retcon?"

startrek,"Was there ever a StarTrek.com article, video, infographic, or an interview with someone important who confirmed that Starfleet formed in 2136? 

I know we can narrow it down to a moment set during 2130-2134 taking place ""a few years prior,"" that the series bible for Enterprise said it was younger than 20 years old as of 2151, that the novel adaptation of Broken Bow (by Brannon Braga himself) said it was ""a decade or more"" (meaning about 10 years, but not younger) as of 2151, and that it existed on-screen in 2136. 

Based on the above on-screen stuff, we can conclude that it has to have formed in 2132-2136, with 2134-2136 making the most sense. But when you add in the off-screen stuff, especially the book, 2136 needs to be the year (because ""a decade or more"" implies circa 2141, so we'd need to use whichever year in the range is closest to that). Did official off-screen sources ever confirm that 2136 is when Starfleet formed?"

startrek,"Why did Seven of Nine have fake memories? (VOY ""Retrospect"")"
startrek," In-universe,  the reason is that warp drive is too slow—you would need Sleeper ships or some alternative (non-organic crew?) to travel to another galaxy. But the writers could have made warp  drive as fast as they wanted, so we have to step out of the fictional  universe to really answer the question.

The  current arrangement, where travel to the other side of the galaxy takes  a lifetime and intergalactic travel is vastly beyond Starfleet’s  capabilities, is actually very helpful to *Star Trek*’s writers because it gives them a lot of options for where a story can be placed:

* Close  to the Federation’s core worlds, where resupply is easy and things are  usually pretty safe, but there are a lot of friendly people who might be  threatened by a villain.
* At the edge of the Federation, where there’s more danger to the ship and help is weeks away.
* In unexplored space, where they could encounter almost anything and really need to be self-reliant.
* Several years from home, like in *Q Who?*, where the journey home is daunting but still plausible.
* A lifetime from home, like in *Voyager*, where they’re completely isolated and really just running on hope.
* A  truly hopeless distance from home, such as another galaxy, where they  are totally screwed unless they can succeed in the next 44 minutes of  television.
* The Spore drive cannot operate outside the milky way
* The Burn still being a problem in the 32nd
* Hits the warp 10 factor transforms humans in space lizards
* Only the USS Protostar have a ""proto drive"" by default... (in 2383!)
* GREAT BARRIER (Maybe or not builded by the Q's)

If *Star Trek*  had routine intergalactic travel, these distance scales would be much  harder to pull off. Travel within a galaxy would be almost  instantaneous, so that scale is pretty much useless. You’d increase the  absurdity of “transbeaming down to the star system” (er, which of the thousands of  cities do you mean, sir?) by talking about “arriving in the M33 galaxy”  or whatever. And what if you *truly*  wanted something to come from an unimaginable distance? “From the  Andromeda galaxy” is way easier for people to understand than “from the Laniakea to the observable universe!!.

Or ad least piloting unmanned probes to the dwarf galaxies.

The  single-galaxy scale also means that, when a ship is traveling between  places, it can encounter a lot of stuff along the way. The interstellar  space of *Star Trek* is already implausibly dense with interesting stars, anomalies, and ships, but audiences don’t quite realize that. Everyone *knows*,  though, that intergalactic space consists of vast stretches of complete  void; many more viewers would realize how unrealistic it was that the *Enterprise* would stumble across a disabled freighter or negative space wedgie on the way to a peace conference in Andromeda.

So, from the writer’s perspective (out-universe), confining the action in *Star Trek*  to the Milky Way is a big advantage. It provides a simpler, yet richer,  environment for storytelling, with many more useful plot options.

Long live and prosper, People of the Earth. Why is there no intergalactic travel in Star Trek?"

startrek,"Throughout Discovery, we very rarely get a good view of the ship itself.

Many times, when a show would traditionally show the ship doing something, such as firing weapons or being struck from the outside, we do not see it happen. 

Then when if we do see it, the camera is twisting around its frame, not showing a view of the whole ship.

Between-scene shots of the ship do happen, but they are rare.

The only time we see it is either when it does something unique like DASH jumping or something.

Then at the end of Season 1 and Season 2, when they are joined by the Enterprise, we are treated to long, sweeping shots of the 1701. Again and again it shows externals, but rarely the Discovery itself. Any times it does show the Discovery it is from far away, taking in the whole battlefield.

Then, finally, in season 3 we get a complete visual overhaul of the ship. We still do not see it much, but we see it a bit more than before.

Do the producers not think the public want to see the ship? Why else would they refuse to show it much? Do the producers think that the Discovery is ugly?"

He's often shown reading and working with comm panels of different races with little if any difficulty. He's worked with Federation, Klingon, Trill and many others. 

But practically speaking, there's probably a school (or at least a program) that teaches the languages Starfleet needs its officers to know, like we have the DLI in Monterey, California. If you're the ambassador to Vulcan, you've probably studied the language formally, and don't need the UT. Duolingo even offers Klingon now. Saru and Uhura know several languages.

startrek,"Watched Star Trek all my life, love TNG-Voy eras. In a two parter in DS9 where the dominion and cardassians are teasing an attack, and a changing infiltrates the Yukon runabout to blow up the bajoran sun, the defiant catches on and major Kira tells Dax to go to warp to catch them. Dax questions the order likes it’s too dangerous and Kira forces it, pushing the defiant to engage a tractor beam right off of dropping out of warp to push the runabout off course, saving the star. No idea what made this so dangerous to do.
Still assuming your not suppose to warp in a system with a Star or inhabited planets, truly don’t know which one, runabouts are capable of warp. DS9 used thrusters to push itself to the wormhole away from Bajor, and from what I found out it’s roughly 1000km away from the planet. This is probably wrong, but my point is in canon it takes a runabout 5 hours to get to bajor, so they obviously don’t warp there.

I miss the older approach, where there was more of a sense of era with the sound design. It doesn't totally break the experience for me, but it always feels weird hearing a TNG-era LCARS sound in the midst of a show taking place in the late 2250s. I wish there was more of an intent behind it. Starfleet sound design nitpick in the newer treks"
startrek,"I have seen a number of people with the misconception that because Pike knows his own fate it ruins the suspense of dangerous situations or means any decision he makes will work out. However, this is not actually this case. 

As captain, every decision he makes effects other people and can potentially get other people killed. Just because *he* cannot die before his ""time"" does not mean his crew can't, and he clearly cares about them.

So let's just do one ""example"" scenario: Pike decides to lead a dangerous away mission because he knows he personally cannot die on that mission. But that doesn't mean he can't be injured or captured. So if he is injured or captured, now they have to send another team to try to rescue him, and some of those people are killed. OR, while he is down on the planet something bad happens up on the ship because a less experienced person was in command.

Basically, any change he makes in his ""normal"" decision making process due to his future knowledge can still have extremely bad/deadly effects for other people. And the only way he can try to avoid that is to try to make the same decisions he would normally make if his own life were at risk.

It's actually a very complicated situation to be in, and something a lot of people seem to misunderstand. Why Pike knowing his fate does not ruin the suspense or mean everything he does will turn out well"

The entire issue the federation has with Illyrians is that they genetically augmented themselves, which the federation pre-judges as bad. So naturally it seems logical she would want to hide it.

So much so that in episode two, she changes the away teams faces to look like the alien race they needed to go undercover with. How on earth would somebody with her skill set not notice immediately that her genes were augmented In a fashion that was much different than humans.

I couldn’t find anyone else talking about this, but the Illyrians in episode 3 seemed to me like an analogy for queer people. (I could also definitely see it being interpreted as about race, but that’s just how it read to me).

For example, the eugenics war (at least in this case) could be symbolic of the aids crisis. 

Or this whole series of lines when La’an and Una are discussing Una being an Illyrian:

Una: And there’s nothing wrong with that.

La’an: If that’s what you believe [that there’s nothing wrong with it], why do you hide it? Why hide it from *me*?

Una: I’ve been hiding it from a lot of people. All I ever wanted, since I first saw the stars, was to join Starfleet.

Now imagine for a second that they’re not talking about her being Illyrian, but about her being queer. Those lines still fit, don’t they?

Or, even more blatantly, after she tells Pike about her being Illyrian, she asks in her personal log:

“What if I hadn’t saved all those lives? Would the captain feel the same? What would he do if I wasn’t a hero? One of the ‘good ones’? When will it be enough to just…be an Illyrian?”

This line I feel has ties to both queerness and race. However, I’m going to stick to addressing the queer ties.

It is phrased in a very specific way. Often, queer people are referred to as “one of the good ones” when they aren’t overt about their queerness — when they seek to blend into straight society.

Or, better described by a word coined by Yuvraj Joshi: Respectable queerness.

Star Trek has a history of incorporating queer allegories into the epsiodes. For a more in depth view of the history of queerness within Star Trek I recommend this article: https://www.startrek.com/news/your-guide-to-queer-identity-and-metaphor-in-star-trek?amp

Isn’t it awesome!” And after a few minutes he admitted there were way more men than women in the other series and that it was cool of them to turn it around. (yay!)

So last night I got onto Amazon prime to continue watching the show, and was surprised by how low it was rated, so I scrolled down to read the reviews. 

Big mistake. 

One star rating after another, and every single one of them was **compaining** that either:

1. That there were too many women
2. That too many of the actors were only hired for “political correctness” - i.e. there are too many non-white people

startrek,"My son &amp; I are doing a watch-them-all. We're currently in TNG season 5, and, to my surprise, we've only seen the Borg twice, in ""Q Who"" (TNG S2e16) and in the 2-part ""The Best of Both Worlds"" (TNG S3e26 &amp; S4e1).

And coming up, we'll only see the Borg in TNG 2 more times: ""I, Borg"" (TNG S5e23) and the 2-part ""Descent"" (TNG S6e26 &amp; S7e1).

The Borg never show up in DS9, and they show up only once in ENT: ""Regeneration"" (ENT S2e23).

Basically, the Borg are a Voyager thing. They show up in VOY 11 times -- but even then not until the 3rd season, with most of the appearances in seasons 6 &amp; 7.

They are never seen in DSC, never in STS, once in LDS -- but only as holos -- and never in PRO. It seems to have taken until PIC season 2 for writers to remember that the Borg are interesting.

I finished ENT not so long ago, and I just loved how the NX-01 looks like. In SNW, even in the intro, the ship makes a certain maneuver, that resembles to one often done by Archers's ship. Some cut-scenes in the new episode also reminded me of that ship, especially the nacelles.

startrek,"  

I was born in 1973. That means that on September 28, 1987 I was 14 and just about to start high school. As it happens. 9/28/87 was also the date of the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. I had already been “indoctrinated” to Star Trek from the original series being in syndication for some years and the idea that the concept could be taken further was a bit of a dream come true. This new adventure of space and possibility was something to really take my mind in a natural direction and it took my heart with it. I met LaForge, Data, Worf, Crusher, Troy and of course Riker and Picard… which is why I’m writing this now. These people/characters (right or wrong) hold a place in my heart that cannot be denied or deleted. So when I sit down to watch Picard 34 years later, it’s not just “nostalgia”, it’s like seeing friends I have not seen in so many years. It’s like being home again in a way that I know is really not possible…. But I don’t care. I’m letting Hollywood manipulate my memories and emotions, willingly. I love the laughter and tears that come from this silly TV show. 

I’m only half-way into the first season, so forgive me if I don’t “get it” yet and I am still in the euphoria phase but I just needed to post this and tell someone that this is unreasonably meaningful to me. newb to Picard"
startrek,Choose only one Which is better deep space nine or next generation
startrek,Thoughts? Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has a higher critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes than Star Trek: The Next Generation. What are your thoughts?
startrek,"I'll go first. The most gangster moment for me was when he was wanting outside arbitration dealing with the Sheliak. When he cut off communication after they were disenchanted with the suggestion of waiting 6 months since they didn't want to give 3 weeks to evacuate the colonists. It was a very gangster move! He even left them waiting for him to respond to their hail! When Riker said, ""You enjoyed that!"" and his response was, ""You're damned right!"". Over the moon man! Most Gangster TNG Captain Picard moment."

startrek,Yeah curious on what are the best stories in the franchise. what are the best episodes of star trek?

startrek,"My dad and I love stupid dad jokes, especially Star Trek ones!  Drop your best ones here and I may say a few of my own! What are everyone’s Best Star Trek Dad jokes?"
startrek,"I was recently watching a video on the emergence of the first corporate entity, the Dutch East India Company (*Vereenigde* *Oostindische Compagnie*) as a means to better facilitate and govern spice trade, and noticed a phonetic similarity between the word ""*Vereenigde""* and *""Ferengi"".* 

Probably a coincidence, but the Ferengi's intensely capitalistic culture and the East India Company being an emergent form of what the Ferengi credo encapsulates is more like a connection. Origin of the name ""Ferengi"""
startrek,"I was re-watching The Maquis episodes and the line ""It's easy to be a saint in paradise"" reminded me of how DS9 found ways to go to darker than TOS/TNG without ignoring the roots established by its predecessors.

To me, the key seems to be that DS9 serves as an evaluation and test of the morality established in those earlier series. The idea that on the frontier things are rougher, that not everyone plays by the Federation's rules, and eventually the necessity to adapt to the ugliness of war. However, what kept that within the Star Trek universe is the counterbalance. Sisko remarking about the challenges of the frontier, O'Brien lamenting about how ""evolved"" humans can still commit terrible acts when pushed to the brink of starvation and subject to dehumanization, Quark remarking about the darker side of humanity, Bashir arguing to Admiral Ross about how getting in bed with Section 31 abandons the Federation while Ross takes the side that the ends justify the means. Section 31 as a whole only works because it pits cynicism against the more idealistic Bashir and allows us to examine arguments pertaining to war that the show might not have otherwise been able to.

Deep Space 9 didn't simply ignore the past or what was established in previous series. Instead it explored and challenged it. To me that's what makes it work. When Star Trek goes dark without counterbalancing it with examination - or to put it another way, to go dark for fun rather than because it serves a greater message/narrative -  then it just feels lazy. This isn't meant as an attack on newer Star Trek, but more an observation on what made DS9 often work so well in my opinion.

Star Trek is in its roots optimistic and while it can absolutely deviate from that optimism effectively, the burden is on the writer to justify that decision and examine it within the work. Otherwise what makes Star Trek unique among sci-fi is diminished. Why DS9's darker tone worked while still feeling true to Star Trek"

startrek,"Species 8472 was one of the most powerful species the known galaxy faced and they nearly wiped out the Borg. I wonder, are their powers strong enough to contend with V'ger if they met? If V'ger encountered Species 8472"
startrek,"Unpopular opinion perhaps: but I loved the Klingon design in Discovery. Not just their appearance as a species, but their clothing and the depiction of their ship architecture. I found it more plausible for an alternate humanoid species evolved around continuous war and violence.  


  
It made me reimagine Worf, and the other popular og-trek Klingons in the alternative appearance and presentation. I also thought it could have actually presented more of a challenge to be diplomatic and look beyond appearances, but as we all know Discovery went straight for Wars in the Stars. But for one of our favorite Captains to try and find the diplomatic route with them would have been an amazing episode. Imagining the anthropology required, the communications and ability for our captain to look beyond the surface.

&amp;#x200B;

It's had me trying to imagine episodes and series staples which would have been made interesting  if Discovery Klingons were the Klingons in them and felt I'd share in case it inspires some imagining from others. Reimagining older Trek with Discovery Klingons."

startrek,"I've been seeing a lot of hate about how SNW ""broke canon"" by introducing a second eugenic war. Some have theorized that the timeline was simply shifted in order to make it relevant since 1992-1996 happened 30-26 years ago (which in fairness, the showrunners of PIC straight up admitted was something they heavily debated until deciding to go with their Project Khan Easter Egg instead). However, neither is true. Enterprise introduced the second Eugenics War.

More specifically, there has always been more than one Eugenics War, and then Enterprise clarified (or retconned, depending how you look at it) that ""more than one"" means ""exactly two."" We all just didn't notice because we Mandela Effected ourselves into thinking ""Eugenics Wars"" meant ""augments are fighting"" instead of, you know, being about eugenics. Let me explain:

In ""Space Seed,"" Spock's dialogue includes ""The mid-1990s was the era of your last so-called world war."" While the WWIII part and the later line of the episode being 200 years after 1996 were certainly retconned, what's important is that McCoy immediately follows that up by replying, and I quote, ""The Eugenics Wars."" Plural. The events of 1992-1996 was one eugenics war. McCoy tells us there were multiple.

Later in ""The Savage War,"" we learn that Colonel Green led a genocidal war in the early 21st century. Enterprise (in ""Demons"" and ""Terra Prime"") elaborated on Colonel Green's genocidal war as involving he and his armies personally murdering hundreds of thousands of people with radiation sickness and other ""impurities"" in order to make sure that they couldn't pass down such traits to subsequent generations.

Guys. THAT'S A EUGENICS WAR. Colonel Green was leading a war centered on selective breeding. A literal eugenics war. It just didn't involve augments this time.

From there, SNW tells us that a Eugenics War followed on the heels of the Second Civil War before spiraling into WWIII. Cool tidbit, but it's not a removal of the 1990s war involving Khan nor is it a transition of its timeline. It's just that the second Eugenics War's time period of ""early 21st century"" is now clarified as being ""around 2026"" (or more specifically, right before WWIII).

Recent Trek social media infographics have also confirmed there have been two as well. ""Genetic Modification: -The Cause of Both Eugenics Wars. - Not just for tomatoes!"" and other tidbits. Fun stuff, as well as gives us confirmation that the augment war of the 2020s wasn't just a timeline shift of the one from the 1990s. Friendly reminder that the Second Eugenics War was introduced in Enterprise, not Strange New Worlds."
startrek,"Ok, so in TNG Guinan meets Picard for the first time in ""Time's Arrow"" ass we all know, but when Picard travels back to 2024 Guinan does not recognize him. This is explained by the fact that this 2024 was the past of the Confederacy Timeline ([source here](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-picard-guinan-memory-tng-plot-hole/)) so TNG never happened and Picard never met Guinan in Time's Arrow, hence her not recognizing him. 

My problem with this, though, is that at the end of Picard Guinan points out a picture of Rios and that she knew him. If Rios stayed behind in 2024, that should have been in the Confederacy Timeline. The Guinan we see at the end of Picard is the Guinan who met JL Picard in Time's Arrow, not the one who didnt know who JL was or personally experienced the confederacy 2024. Now I can understand her being somewhat aware of the events that happened bc she is capable of having knowledge of other timelines (Yesterday's Enterprise) but the existence of the photo of Rios should be impossible. There is now way that he should have affected their current timeline. There should be no version of him in the TNG past.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone make sense of this? Question about Guinan and Rios"
startrek,"I’m terms of bad for me it’s the Alamarain scene in DS9, and in terms of good but sad it’s the final DS9 scene where Jake and Kira are looking out the window as the camera zooms out of DS9. What is the hardest scene for you to sit through (for better or worse) in Star Trek?"
startrek,"This is something that has bugged me for YEARS, so I thought I would throw it out there and see what all of you think.

The ""supposed"" first contact with the Ferengi occurred in 2364 when the Enterprise-D encountered them in the 1st season episode ""The Last Outpost.""  Are we really truly to believe that NO ONE in the Alpha Quadrant had heard of the Ferengi until more than half way through the 24th Century?  The Ferengi seem to have been an economic power with widespread contacts in much of the Alpha Quadrant, but somehow they had no contact with the Federation until 2364?

Ok, so the Ferengi had contact with the Federation/Starfleet in 2355 at the Battle of Maxia that saw the demise of the Stargazer...so are we to believe the Ferengi had a major battle with a Federation starship for the first time then, and then never had sought out the Federation at large for another 9 years?  What do you think?

The Borg: ok this one has been debated to death, but the conversation on my other post from yesterday (05/24/2022 about the most resonating moments in Star Trek history) spurred this question, plus my re-watching of half of the Season 5 Voyager episode ""Dark Frontier"" last night.

Official ""first contact"" with the Borg was by the Enterprise-D in 2365 from the 2nd season episode ""Q, Who?""  But then we find out that 7 of 9's parents set out on their own in 2355 to track down rumors of the Borg, and lo and behold, they find a cube somewhere I'm guessing in the Beta Quadrant in or near Romulan space.

But wait - the Borg had to have been known of by the Federation in at least 2293 when the Enterprise-B rescued the survivors of the El-Aurian homeworld's destruction.  Someone from those ships had to have debriefed Starfleet on who destroyed their world...?

And let's take it back even further to 2153 with the events of the Season 2 episode of Enterprise ""Regeneration"" where the NX-01 is partially assimilated by left over Borg tech from the sphere the Enterprise-E blew up over Earth in 2063.  So...Starfleet had to have known of the Borg in 2153, and quite possibly some human discovered them before then from 2063-2153...

Lastly: the Vulcans.  We know official First Contact was 2063 with Earth, but the Enterprise episode ""Carbon Creek"" establishes the Vulcans were on Earth as far back as 1957, though that appears to have been accidental as their ship crashed.  And now, from the episode in Picard Season 2 we see that there were at least two other Vulcans (that looked like they crash landed) on Earth in the late 1980s or early 1990s and influenced the life of future FBI Agent Martin Wells.  Maybe these Vulcans that influenced Wells crashed like T'Pol's ancestor in 1957, or were they doing some sort of duck-blind study of humanity like we see Starfleet doing in TNG's Season 3 ""Who Watches the Watchers"" and Star Trek: Insurrection?

Thoughts?  Do you know of more first contacts like this? First Contacts that Weren't"
startrek,"So I watched ""Errand of Mercy"" and ""A Private Little War"" last night.  I had seen the former but not the latter.  Kor is so much more subtle and insidious than later Klingons.  And the fact that the Klingons look to be playing ""the long game"" in ""A Private Little War"" by arming one faction of a less-developed race over another by arming them with flintlock rifles.

So what happened to the Klingons after TOS?  We don't see much in TMP other than them trying to fight V'Ger, but in Star Trek III Kruge is a bit more brutish than Kor and Kang (I'll try to re-watch Day of the Dove tonight).  The Klingons in ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" were a bit brutish but even Captain Koloth was more reserved than later Klingons.

My theory was they needed to ""thug up"" the Klingons to make them truly evil and easier to root against.

But maybe my own theory is off because General Chang in the Undiscovered Country is pretty ruthless and shrewd...and Chancellor Gorkon seemed to march to a different (Klingon) drummer.  Worf also was pretty reserved, but that is because of the influence that humans had on him I think. TOS Klingons Were Much More Conniving"
startrek,"Since the end of Season 2 of Picard, there’s been a lot of legitimate concern about the handling of established events in canon and the apparent change of the timeline of events. Some of this is a problem created by the new shows constantly going back between established events. It will naturally cause some problems no matter how well they handle it. 

I had a thought that I wanted to propose: maybe it’s time to start viewing Star Trek with comic book rules. What I mean by that is in comics, what matters is that certain characters and events exist, but it doesn’t matter when they happened. They can put Batman in the 1970s or the 2020s, and his parents were still killed, he still has Robin, hems still fighting Joker, Riddler, Two-Face in Gotham, but none of it is tied to a specific timeline unless it’s specific to the story. What they maintain is the characters, the setting, the thematic elements, and care little for any canonic timeline. 

So maybe we know First Contact is an established event but don’t know (or care) when it happens, because we know it was after the Eugenics Wars, the NX-01 is 100 years after that, NCC-1701 is 100 years after that, NCC-1701-D is 100 years after that, etc. We keep the relationships between events, but it doesn’t have to be tied to a specific origin date that ends up creating problems. 

Or maybe they should just not be time-traveling to or directly referencing the present day real world. Canon/Timeline discrepancies"
startrek,"1. The borg have now has a hole new history. Everything related to them changes. 
2. I don't understand what project khan is supposed to be, when the eugenics war are already over. At least by cannon.
3. How does Ricos have a happy and long life as described by Guinen when WW3 is about to begin in 2 years. 

I just hate how much they are fracturing the timeline and I just can't accept the answer to be a new/alternative timeline every time. ST Picard just breakes the timeline"
startrek,"I'm on my first-ever watch-through of Star Trek: Voyager, and I've finally reached the first really fun episode I've seen: The silly 1996 time-travel romp ""Future's End.""  It's not just a fun story with a good script, but the guest cast is terrific, and I also think David Livingston must be one helluva director, because Sarah Silverman (!) is way better here, I think, than when she was on Monk (which was fun, but she felt to me like a comedian delivering lines, and here she's doing real acting), and the cast seems to have a nice casual rapport that they don't always pull off. (Janeway and Chakotay sauntering through California is genuinely charming even when very little happens.) VOY S3E8: ""Future's End, Part 1"""

I was reading through the [StarTrek Timeline Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Star_Trek) and was baffled when I came across this:

Was it added in Prodigy while I wasn't paying attention?

Is this from some novel I haven't read?

Please, help fill me in. When Was StarFleet HQ Being Bombed by a Warp Core Added to Cannon?"
startrek,"A few years ago I decided that I wanted to break into Star Trek. I believe this was about 3-4 years ago to be “exact.” If you asked me at the time whether I was a Star Wars guy or a Star Trek guy I would’ve absolutely answered Star Wars. I’m not the type of person who believes you have to ally with one camp; it just happens to be a popular question! Regardless, Disney has demolished my interest in the main Star Wars film series with the recent sequel additions (though I will always love the original trilogy). That on top of Disney siphoning every last drop of material they could from their purchased franchise had burned me out on all things Star Wars, but that’s besides the point. I was curious about Star Trek.

Part of what drove my decision to start down this insanely long path was the fact that I already had a bit of a relationship with Star Trek (as I imagine most if not all Americans do). I enjoyed the movies with Chris Pine (controversial I know), but more importantly I had memories of TNG from my childhood (born in 1990). My Grandpa was a huge Star Trek fan and was always watching TNG as it came out. I was too young at the time to really absorb the material, but the memories are still there creating an inevitable association between Star Trek and my Grandpa.

So I did a bit of research to get a better understanding of all of the Star Trek material and what direction I should go. The “Where Should I Start” post on this sub was actually a HUGE help in this regard. There was more Trek out there than I expected, but in the end the starting point was an easy decision…The Next Generation. Just about every list I found ranked TNG as the best series, and it was specifically called out as a good starting point for people who are new to Trek and who might find TOS too cheesy. 

Going into this I knew that Star Trek (at least the old school stuff) could be quite cheesy with cheap sets and special effects layered with mediocre acting and absurd fight choreography. Knowing this from the start probably helped me stay on course as long as I have since I knew what to expect. On top of that I have a couple of coworkers who are hardcore Trekkies, and taught me on what to expect and look forward to! One key piece of information for me was that TNG (and most Star Trek shows) had a rough start for the first couple of seasons. Knowing that it gets a lot better helped me work through the weaker earlier episodes, even though I still enjoyed them for the most part. At first it was hard to take the acting seriously, but as TNG went on it got a lot better. It seems that as the show progressed the actors honed in on their characters and their chemistry with their co-stars. I’m sure there are numerous other factors potentially including my own lens of the show, but either way the improvement was palpable. I was hooked. 

Now the way that I have been watching Star Trek is a bit unique. It has become part of my work lunch ritual. I get an hour lunch every day I work from the office, and I use that to hide away and de-stress. This includes a comforting meal alongside Star Trek on my phone. It is my getaway and makes each work day so much more enjoyable. Outside of work I don’t have a lot of solo TV time, so work lunches have consisted of 95% of my Star Trek viewings. This is the reason that I’m only 2 series in after a few years. On the bright side it means I will be watching new episodes (to me) for years to come!

At this point I have finished the entire TNG series, and I just finished DS9 last week. Both were so good by the end! I was unsure on my next step, but ultimately landed on The Original Series. I am only a few episodes in, and I am shocked at how much I am loving it. I knew it was famously cheesy and low budget, but there is something about it that I just enjoy. It's almost like a bunch of 1960’s men time traveled to the future, were handed control of a spaceship, and sent out to do their thing. Unintentionally hilarious at times, and yet still enthralling. I’m psyched to work through the episodes and then the movies! 

I guess what I am getting at, and why I felt like breaking my usual lurker status, is that watching Star Trek for the first time has felt like some kind of culturally educational experience. I feel like I am gaining something by watching it. A connection to something that has existed for decades and has captivated fans all over the world for just as long. And seeing how active and supportive (other times confrontational of course) the Star Trek community can be has been an extra source of joy for me. While I was still working my way through TNG my Grandpa passed away, so this has also been a way for me to remember him. I never got to tell him about this Star Trek journey I am on, but it doesn’t matter because we always shared a love for Sci-Fi and the shared connection exists regardless. I feel that connection in this community as well.

I don’t know if I have earned the title of a full on Trekkie yet, but I am certainly working towards it. Engage! My Trek Journey So Far"

If someone told me I couldn't wear a medal commemorating my having served in some war while I remember watching my friends die in front of me, I'd probably deck them . . . Would a Trill officer be entitled to wear commendations awarded to a previous host?"
startrek,"  TOS:

Definitely the Balance of Terror that finally, concretely, establishes the Romulans.

Assignment: Earth: We are introduced to the Supervisors and Gary Seven, which we later see is connected to the Renee Picard/Europa Mission, the death of Q, the connection with Wesley Crusher and the Travelers, the rise of Adam Soong and his Project Khan and even the creation of Data, the origins of why the Klingons have smooth foreheads in TOS, and the ""new Borg"" that want to join the Federation.

Space Seed - anything with Khan - his story line inspired three movies and countless episodes throughout the rest of Trek (all the way to Picard and now SNW).

Mirror, Mirror: Mirror Universe has been a MAJOR part of DS9 and Discovery, and was a pretty good two-episode arc in Enterprise.

TOS Movies:

The Undiscovered Country - laid the groundwork for the Klingons to become our allies in the TNG era.

TNG:

Encounter and Farpoint - Establishes Q - a major character/force throughout TNG, Voyager, Picard, he even introduces us to the Borg.

Where No One Has Gone Before: Establishes the Travelers and their eventual involvement in Wesley Crusher's life, and the link with the Supervisors who help usher Earth through dangerous times (Gary Seven, Tallinn/Laris).

Elementary, Dear Data: Establishes Moriarty, a self-aware hologram the presages the Doctor from Voyager and his struggle with securing rights for other self-aware holograms.

Q, Who? - Borg introduction

Measure of a Man: Establishes Data as not the property of Starfleet - leads to repercussions lasting until the time of Picard with the treatment of the Synths and the ban on artificial lifeforms in the Federation.

The Emissary: This is where we first meet K'Ehleyr and she and Worf hook up that ultimately produces Alexander.  Bear with me - but without K'Ehleyr the events in ""Sins of the Father"" from Season 3 don't happen.  So, this episode lays the groundwork for Worf and Picard's involvement in the succession of Gowron to be Chancellor of the Klingon Empire, the Civil War, the destruction of the Enterprise-D by the Duras Sisters over Veridian III, the death of Captain Kirk on that planet, and Gowron pulling the Empire out of the Khitomer Accords and starting a short war with the Federation, and ultimately to Gowron's death by Worf in DS9's seventh season.

Yesterday's Enterprise: SO MUCH happens here - destruction of Enterprise-C, rise of Enterprise-D, Picard names as Captain, treaty with the Klingon Empire secured, the eventual birth of Sela who is integral in Spock's reunification efforts of the Romulan and Vulcan people.

The Offspring: Data produces his child - sets up more implications twenty years later with the Synth attack on Mars, banning of artificial lifeforms, etc.

Best of Both Worlds: Obvious - Picard is assimilated, the Borg almost take Earth/the Federation, Riley Frazier from the USS Roosevelt is assimilated and later becomes part of a disconnected Collective on a planet in the Delta Quadrant and saves Chakotay's life.  Jennifer Sisko is killed in the Battle of Wolf 359 which later helps Benjamin come to grips with the Prophets in the Bajoran Wormhole.  Lays the groundwork for the development of the USS Defiant and Defiant Class, lays the groundwork for the events of First Contact.

Man...I'm not even out of the 4th Season of TNG and I think this will be a VERY long post.

startrek,"I am profoundly disappointed with Discovery and Picard and here's why. There's a very simple structure to al TOS, TNG, DS9, Voy and ENT episodes; a very clear beginning, middle and end. Characters have established arcs and their actions follow their established traits in a consistent and logical way. I don't even have to provide examples, because if you've ever watched one of these shows, many should immediately come to mind.

Within this framework, morality tales are told that endeavour to show multiple sides of the issue being explored. Based on cultural values which are either established through canon or explained in the beginning of the episode, we have an immediate understanding of their position and why they behave the way they do. It's analagous to chess; we all know how the pawn, the knight, the rook and the queen move and it's up to the writer to position them in interesting ways. 

Modern Star Trek rejects this template in favor of something I do not comprehend. The ingredients are there, but the meal is badly prepared. Everything is very loosely connected (if at all) and the emphasis is on how characters *feel individually* as opposed to how they *behave cooperatively.* I find the legacy of Star Trek to be an ill fit for this type of storytelling -- round peg, square hole.

If you genuinely prefer Picard or Discovery over older Star Trek, I'd be very interested to hear which elements of the new shows appeal to you. I don't understand how these shows find their audience and would like to learn. What am I missing? Old versus new."

startrek,"to be very fair , i havent browsed similar discussions and have only recently become active on reddit after a year or so of being dormant. so i wanted to finally have a convo on what I consider the Star Trek girl. i've been a megafan since 2015 , granted i was a kid , and watching TOS my sisters would sometimes poke fun at how Uhura seemed so sexualised. In 2020 , with online classes and being a lazy 8th grader I binged TNG and Voyager and came to the conclusion. Uhura , Deanna and Seven of Nine are like the characters that have to have some sex appeal , even T'Pock. like in the case of Seven and Deanna they have a specific tight fitting uniform , not that there's anything wrong with that its more like yo this is different and im sure this indicates a special thing of emphasising their attractiveness as a a character trait. maybe it was to make the show more interesting to casual viewers who could focus on pretty people when the ethical dilemmas became too 'bland' although the philosophical stuff is my personal fave heh. anyways its not fair to say they were Bond Girls at all , they were defined as attractive but had their own characters , depth and place as their own person but i feel like they were also supposed to be defined as 'sexier' which is really interesting, so only in that dimension of character they strike me as . Uhura i feel like had to be clothed like that or portrayed , because of the era, the fact that as disturbing as it is may be bigoted people would be more lenient with seeing a POC if she was more sexualised and also cos female characters kind of had to be defined as very pretty to the primarily male audience to be certified as a valid protagonist. Still its interesting  to see and Im glad it eased over time . This is more so an undeveloped thought from almost 2 years ago I just randomly remembered to discuss it with people besides my Trekkie family and saintly friends, Lemme know if its kind of an at surface observance or valid or just plain wrong. Im excited to expand my horizons and prosper. maybe it was just a tactic to make it more appealing in the mainstream at the time? The Star Trek Girl is the More Complex kind of like a Bond Girl of the Federation. ( an observation ive had since 2020)"

For those that are unaware, the DS9 documentary ""What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" featured a hypothetical first episode for a hypothetical season 8 of the show. This hypothetical episode featured a ship designed by John Eaves, the USS Emmett Till.

I made a Lego model based on the concept art, with a few adjustments to incorporate design language from Picard's USS Stargazer/USS Excelsior. The model is 885 pieces, and 52cm/20.5in long.

startrek,"I actually did not want to watch SNW after STD and Picard. I stopped STD after 2nd episode this current season, it just wasn't my thing - I hoped for so long it would become my thing but I finally gave up - power to anyone who can enjoy it. It's just not my thing. After these shows I thought I was done with Star Trek and started looking for other hobbies - Doctor Who was already ruined for me and there is not much other Science Fiction to my liking out there. After hearing so much good stuff about SNW I got P+ last night and watched the first episode and boy let me tell you: You son of a bitch - I am in! I love it. The tone, the design, the sound, the setting and camera, the characters, the story. It all works for me. THANKS TO ALL CREATORS FOR BRINGING STAR TREK BACK! Keep it up, please! Strange New Worlds is the best Trek since TNG - change my mind!"

startrek,"I just saw the new 4K Remaster of The Motion Picture with Fathom Events in theater and quite enjoyed it, does anyone know if they are planning on releasing the next 5 remaining TOS movies as 4K Director's Cut Remasters in the future for paramount plus and Fathom Events?

startrek,"I love Star Trek Strange New Worlds so far! I love the special effects, the characters from the original series and seeing Spock again! My only suggestion is this: I hope Star Trek Strange New Worlds will have lgbtq+ representation in some way. Maybe a transgender character,  a lesbian couple, or a gay couple. That would be awesome! There needs to be more queerness in sci-fi. LGBTQ+ Representation for Strange New Worlds"
startrek,"I am a giant TNG fan as well as really any of the Star Trek series until Discovery though strange new worlds has not been terrible

startrek,The ads on the no ad plan and the lack of episode changing drop down are the worst. Does it bother you that the Paramount+ app is so annoying to use?
startrek,"I took my girlfriend out to the Fathom events showing of Star Trek: The Motion Picture this Monday. She’s been watching some Strange New Worlds lately, but is new to Trekdom. Here’s some observations that are humorous, and spot on:
- Thought the V’Ger flyby was too long and still doesn’t provide context of what’s happening especially when flying through the cloud. 
- Was surprised it took Spock so long to rejoin the crew. She was that expecting to happen much sooner.
- Appreciated the Goldsmith music score. Perhaps influenced by the fact she helped me find the soundtrack at a vinyl record show recently.
- She recognized the Enterprise dry dock scene to be fan service for the time since she could see it on my face.
- Thinks the practical special effects hold up well and were on par with her favored movie SW: A New Hope.
- Was hoping the reveal of V’Ger - instead of the Voyager 6 probe, would have been a toaster instead. Hear me out, imagine the away team cresting that rise only to find a toaster. The only thing this toaster wants from its creator is for somebody - centuries later - to finally put some bread in it and let it fulfill its mission: to create toast. If they ever remaster TMP for VR or something, let this be an option. Girlfriend’s first time watching TMP: Her review of remastered edition in theater"
startrek,"Because Lando Calrissian was so much cooler, and this is why Starfleet made him Captain of DS9 all those years. Picard was a weak Captain, and here's why."
startrek,"

Creating a test that is inherently impossible doesn't show someone's capability of dealing with a ""no-win scenario"". 
It's a simulation. No one even cares about winning anymore.
It's almost a rite of passage because at the end of the day, most people will take it and just follow their lifes and learn nothing from it, because if the result is the same for everyone, it will not show anything.

Kobayashi Maru was really more of an analysis on how people deal with a test and Kirk was actually the only one that noticed how it's predictability wasn't that big of a deal.

Definitely arrogant ngl, but simply accepting a problem will not make it go away and even though hacking was kinda dumb, it shows how he would not just panic or sit and do nothing.
He would try to save everyone to the end, and the Kobayashi Maru test doesn't value this, hence the hacking

If u think about it the Kobayashi maru in AOS was just an extrapolated version of Kirks thinking in The Corbomite Manouver.

Too exaggerated? Yes. Was he wrong? Yes.
But at the same time it is illogical to believe that a simulation that everyone knows its impossible could actually be a real mirror to anyone's ability in a real life situation.

Ig the whole idea of the Maru in AOS is just show this creative thinking and it was quite well done for Kirks new personality and different past. I think the AOS Kobayashi Maru was actually flawed"
startrek,"A number of surprising people were under alien makeup. Like Gabrielle Union and Stephen Root both played Klingons, and Don Stark (Bob from That 70's Show) played a Yridian. One of the craziest is that Jeffrey Dean Morgan played a Xindi-Reptilian. Most surprising Star Trek guest stars?"
startrek,"Except for certain philosophical and other subjective courses, many of them are are factual courses that Data could just test out of very quickly. In essence he might be able to do nearly 4 years worth of work in an hour or two.and he might be able to go through the others in a few weeks. So let's be generous and say 6 months and he could graduate. Why did Data go through SF Academy?"
startrek,"For me it is a huge plot hole that Number 1 is Illyrian and has been able to keep it a secret and join Star Fleet.  First, a person in her position would have to have a pretty high security clearance, ergo a pretty strong background check.  In today's world the records are deep enough to find out where you were born, etc. How could she mask her birth place or parentage?  Secondly,  she made reference in episode 3 to her Illyrian body makeup being different than humans and was the reason she was able to fight off the virus. We have seen in virtually every previous Star Trek iteration that every crew member goes through an extensive medical exam to ensure they have the information for future emergencies, needs, etc, not least of which is are they fit to serve.  So how did that get past Star Fleet?  Obviously the writers did not consider this or they would have had Pike ask her the questions to wrap up the holes. Number 1's Secret"

startrek,Not trying to stir the pot just want to know if there was any nay sayers if anyone who watched it when it came out can recall. Was there any controversy about Star Trek when Janeway became the first female Captain lead on a show? Nothing political here I just wasn’t into Trek back then and wonder if there was any backlash at the time. Thank you
startrek,"Say Strange New Worlds is a huge success and runs for several seasons, but Anson Mount wants to leave and do other things.  We already have Spock and Uhura on board, and we know that James Kirk is going to show up sooner or later.  What if other members of the TOS crew show up over time, winding up with JTK taking over as captain, leading into a new series of fresh adventures for the ""original"" crew with a modern budget and special effects?  Hell, you could even imply that it happens contemporaneously with the classic series and throw in some fun references to old episodes.  (""Ugh, I'm STILL picking Tribble fur out of the replicator matrix!""). Would you be down for that, or did the Abramsverse movies prove to you that messing with the classics is a bad idea? Would you like to see SNW turn into a TOS reboot"
startrek,"To be honest my dad wasn't around much before he died. He had a lot of issues with alcoholism and I never got to know him personally at all. Like at all. He was always out and away from the house. I know nothing about him besides the most basic of facts. I had and still have a lot of anger about him, but as I grow older, now nearing 22, I just wish I had a dad. 

How does this relate to Star Trek? Well. Like I said, I didn't know much about my dad. He liked the 49ers and sports. I don't care about sports. He liked camping and we did it a few times and while I enioy it I don't really associate it with him. He had me young and was very much still in a sort of frat stage of drinking and partying. There wasn't anything really I have ever liked or had that has ever made me feel tied to him. Until I gave Star Trek the Next Generation a try. 

He had all of these Star Trek toys, I dug them out again recently. They got a little weather beaten but still mostly fine. I never was into it. My mom was a Star Wars fan and definitely had that old mentality of nerds only being able to like one or the other. I was told it was just a boring show so I never tried it as a kid or teen. But more and more of my friends were into it. Many times over and over my friends recently have been talking about Star Trek. Citing Next Generation and Deep Space Nine as masterpieces. I figured why not see for myself? And started it. We've been watching it together as we hang out. And I have grown to love Picard. Riker. Data. LaForge. And all the rest of them. And last night as we were watching an episode after I finished DMing DnD still hanging out. A feeling of sadness entered me. 

I brought down the mood a bit. I didn't mean to. I was enjoying the episode so much I just couldn't help but think. ""I just wish my dad was here so I could talk about this to him."" And it struck me just for the first time ever I had thought that. I've never before thought that. I never had anything to relate to him. And I sort of said this and my friends just sort of uncomfortably nodded and I moved on. But I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about having the experience to actually be able to bond with my dad over something. Get to sit down with him and just talk about this. I feel ridiculous for tearing up now typing it. But I feel robbed. I feel robbed of getting to experience this and tell my dad we are alike in some way. Tell him my thoughts. My favorite characters and episodes. But I'll never know his. And to be honest that makes me angry. I want to be able to go to him and talk to him about a new favorite episode and see him nod and remember it. Or talk about a certain character and something they did. I wanna know his thoughts and how he would have reacted to me watching it. How he'd smile or get excited. But I just won't. 

I needed to put this out there. I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I made my friends uncomfortable and talking about it to my mom is just sure to make her sad on the topic. And just thinking it isn't helping. I needed to get this out as words on screen or on paper. I'm sorry if this isn't the type of content allowed on this subreddit. I just don't know where else to go. 

I'm loving Star Trek and I want to continue with it I just feel like something is missing now. I wish I could talk to my dad about Star Trek"

Then on the advice of a friend I started watching DS9 (after watching all the recommended TNG episodes to preface it) and I got to the episode S05E06 ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" Where they go back in time to the TOS episode ""Trouble with Tribbles""

And while I initially wasn't expecting a lot, I was very impressed at how they didn't screw it up or piss me off (Dagnabit, get off my lawn, etc...) what really struck me though, I mean struck me to the core of my little boy self watching TOS back in the day, in a way I certainly couldn't have verbalized at the time, was the first scene where you see Kirk and Spock walking down the passageway... and man, that Kirk strut... \*MWAH!\*  That's my boy!!!!

startrek,Does anyone know which VR headset Kore uses in Picard season 2? VR headset in Picard Season 2
startrek,"Long time Star Trek fan here, especially someone who loved TNG (since season 2) and DS9. I kinda liked some NuTrek stuff,  for example the first (new) Star Trek movie from 2009 and Lower Decks season 2, but Discovery and Picard, that is something else.

My  critique is not new tho and was mentioned several times on reddit:  The crew of Discovery is not working together at all, emotions are all over the  place, philosophy doesn't matter, many crew members are underdeveloped,  Tilly is not convincing in her role, did I say that emotions are all over the place? Burnham is a  genius scientist and at the same time an awesome tactician, and behaves  like a counselor. Plus, it seems that everything revolves around her. She will solve every problem, alone. 

I  watched Discovery because there were some good ideas and characters in  season 1 and 2: Lorka, Pike, Phillipa and Saru were awesome. But  overall, the main storylines in season 1 and 2 were rather  disappointing. The reveal of the burn in season 3 was the worst I have  seen in sci-fi since a very long time. 

Now season 4: This was a story for maximum of 3 or 4 episodes  (or one long movie) stretched to 13 episodes. I had  hoped that without Tilly, and Burnham now as a Captain, that this could  be a bit better, but damn was season 4 underwhelming. Maybe even one of the worst Star Trek seasons.

For Picard, it's partly the same. The interaction between the main characters is not really convincing, like there is no chemistry at all. Season 1, while the writing was unbalanced, at least had some redeeming qualities. The conspiracy and overall darker elements were interesting, but the last two episodes and some episodes between two and five didn't resonate with me.

Now season 2: It started so great, the first 2 episodes were awesome and the first half of episode 3 was great, but then we had six 'filler' episodes. I know, not directly filler, but it was extremely hard to watch. The ninth episode was the worst (plot holes, plot holes, plot holes).

Long  story short: My main issue is the writing, the characters and their interaction. All these flaws are even more visible in the latest season of Picard and Discovery. The user score on metacritic and rottentomatoes is lower than 3.0 / 30%.

Can someone explain to me what went wrong? Why is it so bad? Or do you all think it's actually good, and I am just overly critical? What went wrong? (Picard season 2, Discovery season 4)"
startrek,"Who has the best Head Cannon theory for Star Trek?

*I posted this last year, but there's been several seasons of shows released since, some stuff has now been proven true/false, and I updated + added a few based on other users ideas that have been written since*

I've heard some great ones over the years, curious what other fans have come up with / heard over the years.

**The Vulcans are descended from augments**

Despite being banned in the Federation, genetic engineering appears to be common place in the Galaxy. Numerous races have tinkered with their own genomes, the Borg and the Dominion actively alter DNA for example. The Federation has banned it ostensibly because of the Eugenics wars, but why is it that the other Federation members have gone along with it? Because most of them had similar experiences.

I'd go so far as the say that surviving the development of Genetic Engineering is one of the pre-warp barriers for a civilization.

1500 years ago the Vulcans experimented with genetic engineering during their early days of space flight. This is the reason the Vulcans have such impressive physical abilities and why they are telepathic. The Romulans, Remans, and the other offshoot species are similarly results of genetic modification. The various problems and conflicts they had in this era where their version of the Eugenics wars.

The Vulcans then banned genetic engineering like the Humans did, which is why they readily accepted/encouraged the ban when joining the Federation.

But unlike humans their Augments weren't all exiled or killed off. The proto-Vulcan race of that era is technically extinct. Today's Vulcans and Romulans are the descendants of interbreeding of original proto-vulcans and the original augments. So they aren't Augments specifically but inherited a number of their traits.

The Aenar may be the result of ancient genetic engineering, and the Denobulans tweaked their genomes as well.

With the Andorians, Vulcans, and humans all having had bad experiences with Genetic engineering it's no wonder the Federation banned it.

**Dr Crusher chose the post on Enterprise to be closer to Picard for Wesley's sake**

Wesley was starting to get himself into trouble on Earth and didn't show a lot of motivation in life until a brief encounter with Jean Luc Picard. Picard showed up at their house while visiting Earth because he wanted to catch up with Beverly. Wesley was super intimidated by him because of the stories he had heard about Picard and his Father and embarrassed himself. Rather than laugh Picard said one of his typical 1 liners to Wesley that ended up giving him a ton of self confidence. That brief encounter had a profound impact on the boy.

Dr Crusher saw what a positive role model Picard was on her son and arranged to be transferred to Enterprise in the hopes that Picard would take Wesley under his wing. Which is why she keeps sneaking him onto the bridge in the early episodes.

**Starfleet has cloaking technology, just not the military kind**

The illegal Pegasus cloak aside, the Federation does have cloaking technology. But it's low grade stuff that they use in duck blinds and the like, not for military vessels.

The Treaty of Algeron only banned military use of Cloaks.

**The Excelsior's Transwarp wasn't a failure, but it didn't meet its lofty expectations either**

The Transwarp drive of the Excelsior is the reason the warp scale got rejiggered between TOS and TNG. It worked and became the new standard for the fleet. The Enterprise D has that version of Transwarp but now they just call it regular Warp Drive instead.

**The Borg Farm civilizations**

The reason the Borg don't just show up in force to Earth is because it isn't to their advantage.

The arrival of a single Cube forces that civilization to make a massive push in cultural and technological development. Just look what the Federation was able to develop in a decade after the Borg showed up.

Eventually the Borg will either show up in such overwhelming force that the Federation doesn't stand a chance, or the Federations technological development will slow down or plateau long enough that a single cube will be enough to assimilate Earth. Then it's game over.

**Garak used the Biomimetic Gel to make the bomb**

There was no buyer for the Biomemetic Gel in In the Pale Moonlight. Garak had the optholithic data rod already and just needed the gel to make the bomb. In typical Garak fashion he'd never tell Sisko what he was actually planning. Bashir even mentions that the Gel can be used to make organic explosives, that arguably can't be traced. Meaning he could have made the Bomb to appear to be just be a sandwich or a plant...

**Earth uses the Vulcan economic system**

One of the reasons Earth was able to recover so quickly after First Contact is because the Vulcans taught humans their system of post-scarcity socialist economics. A system they had spent 1000 years working the bugs out of.

**Replicators are the 24th centuries version of a microwave**

Everyone who eats from a replicator knows the quality of the food is reasonable but doesn't compare to real food. It's like the 24th centuries version of fast food or a vending machine, it takes no effort, it's cheap (free), and they are convenient/ubiquitous. The food in general is also healthier than a modern burger joint.

They are common on Starships because it's an efficient method of feeding a crew on a ship in the middle of nowhere, but on Earth and the colonies people usually eat 'real' food.

**Starfleet has a great pension plan**

Picard's line ""The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity."" can be interpreted as meaning that those that work to better society get compensated for it.

If you don't work society will give you a basic income (like some form of UBI) but you only get the bare minimum needed to survive. While those that work get compensated with better houses, more transporter credits, better entertainment, priority access to medical care, and better food, etc.

This is partly the reason there are so many willing colonists. Earth despite being a paradise is boring and there are only so many jobs. While volunteering to be a colonist is an option for even the uneducated the get their own nice home, land, and benefits that only the well employed and educated usually get. They have to work hard to get it, but to many it's a challenge and a chance at a better (more interesting) life.

Starfleet is a stressful and well educated job, so the ships are designed with the above philosophy of compensation in mind. That's why the ships all have creature comforts like holodecks the Officers seem to be able to use whenever they want. Good food, relatively lavish quarters, and the Officers seem to be able to get lavish goods and a stipend of Gold Pressed Latinum whenever the are off world to buy stuff. These are all perks of the job.

For lack of a better term, Starfleet also has a great pension plan. This is why Starfleet officers seem to get nice retirement homes on Colonies or on Earth. It's a retire perk.

**France is a tourist attraction**

To quote Futurama: ""Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language. Hello! Bonjour! Crazy gibberish""

The theory goes that most of Western Europe was bombed into a Radioactive wasteland during the 3rd World War resulting in much of the worlds population loss. During the early days of space flight European settlers made up most of the early colonization efforts because they wanted to escape the burned out wreck that was Europe. Hence why the Lunar colonies are New Berlin and Tycho City (Denmark), why there's a bunch of Irish + Scottish colonies, etc

The Vulcans helped Earth undo the radioactive damage making much of Europe habitable again (having survived their own Nuclear holocaust 1000 years earlier). But by this point the various countries were depopulated so they invited in tons of foreigners.

The catch was they would give you citizenship and free land with permanent ownership in exchange for you adopting a stereotypically French, German, Italian, etc lifestyle, etc in order to revitalize the local culture.

~~The Picards descend from a family that took this deal, which is why they have a vineyard and consider themselves French even though it seems they have an English background. They probably learned French in school even English had become the defacto universal language of Earth by this time.

There's another working theory that Jean Luc and Robert went to an English Boarding School in Yorkshire where they picked up the accent.~~

Picard Season 2 has made this bit defunct.

**Nick Lorcano was really Tom Paris**

Robert Duncan McNeil and the Producers have confirmed that Lorcano was the inspiration for Tom Paris. An Admirals son that screws up in the Academy and gets kicked out. But they came up with a new character because they felt Nick was irredeemable.

In headcannon Lorcano was Tom Paris' Mother's maiden name. He used the assumed name in the Academy to distance himself from his Father so that he wouldn't be constantly compared to him and have less pressure. Even though most of the Admirals and Teachers knew exactly who he was.

**The Federations war strategy is a combination of tactics used by NATO and Israel**

In the event of a Hot War the Federation sends in Starfleet to hold the line until it's very large pool of reserves can be activated (which is very much like Israel) while the member worlds militaries are called up for wider service (like NATO).

Older Starfleet ships are pulled out of mothballs in fleetyards and can be re-activated and armed with more modern equipment in a matter of weeks. While fleetyards ramp up production to produce newer ships at a much higher rate, but this can take 6 months to a year to make a real difference.

Ships that normally have compliments of 20-50% Starfleet graduates are reduced to only 10%-20%, junior officers are given field promotions providing experienced command crews for a larger fleet, while large numbers of active reserves (retired officers, officers from member worlds own fleets, and large numbers of trained crewman who having taken Starfleet courses to become reservists) are activated to crew the vessels.

Member world fleets like the Vulcans and Andorians send officers to crew Starfleet ships while taking on a wider defensive role within the core Federation territory. This frees up Starfleet to fight on the front.

Starfleet also has a large Marine Corps (Ostensibly referred to as Starfleet Security, and of which O'Brien was originally a member) for ground wars which is backed up by reserves consisting of the indpendant militaries of the various member worlds like Andorian Commandos, Vulcan security, and possibly Earth MACOs (which may have just been the basis for Starfleet Security). These units have their own independent command structures that agree to work under an appointed Starfleet Security Chief of Staff that has operational control, and they have a unified logistics chain with standardized equipment just like NATO.

**Starfleet had a golden century of exploration between Kirk's time and TNG and it left them unprepared for war OR alternately the first Cardassian War was their Vietnam**

Ok so here me out. After the Klingon and Romulan neutral zones were established the Federation entered into a golden age of exploration and doubled its size in less than 100 years. In that time they adopted a military doctrine of parking a Battleship on your door to force you to the negotiating table.

All their major conflicts thus far had been resolved by negotiation so that became the Federations go to philosophy for fighting a galactic conflict. Starfleet switched to having a smaller number of technologically advanced and powerful ships meant to scare potential enemies into negotiating.

Meanwhile they kept a large number of older ships in reserve mothball that could be reactivated if a hot war broke out.

What happened in the first Cardassian war was that Starfleet got out maneuvered and played by an inferior force. Most Cardassian ships were no match for an Excelsior or similar ship of the line so they just gave the Starfleet ships a wide birth and never engaged them directly. Meanwhile they fought a bunch of ground wars where the odds were more even. The Federation by this point had grown too large and Starfleet hadn't grown adequately to protect it, so when a hot war broke out ships were either too far away exploring or they couldn't commit enough resources to the Cardassian sector without putting other sectors at risk.

The Federation council didn't consider this outright war (Police Action) so they didn't activate any of their reserves. Instead they negotiated. Ultimately the Cardassians negotiated away things of lesser value (like agreeing to pull out of Bajor to give the Federation a PR victory) while getting everything they wanted. They only fought battles for the planets that the Federation wouldn't give up.

The Cardassians toyed with the negotiations until they were in a perfect position and then sued for peace. The Federation declared victory anyway and all the colonists in the area were left going ""What the hell just happened?"" and formed the Maquis because the Federation failed to defend their interests. Meanwhile the Cardassians had no intention of keeping up their end of the bargain and violated the treaty all the time knowing the Federation would do anything up to ignoring what the Cardassians were doing to avoid starting another shooting war.

Ultimately it wasn't until the Borg crisis that the Federation finally woke up and realized they were in real trouble militarily.

The Galaxy class for all it's glory was a mistake, the result of bad military doctrine. A battleship in all but name that suffers from the Deathstar principal ""Commanders can't afford to use so called superweapons effectively, because they simply cannot afford to lose one""

Starfleet put children on the ships so that the explorers would feel more at home and make it less likely the ship would get attacked. But to quote Garak ""No, Humans have rules in war"", implying their enemies don't really care if there are civilians on board as the Jem'Hadar proved later on.

Starfleet kinda put all their eggs in one basket and lost 3 Galaxy class ships (Enterprise, Yamato, and Odyssey) within their first 10 years of service... for ships that were supposed to last 100 years or more.

This is also why Starfleet was struggling during the alternate timeline in Yesterday's Enterprise. Starfleet had missed out on 50-75 years of technological development related to warfare so they were caught on the back foot when the Klingon War started and they never really recovered.

**Worf is a paragon of Klingon tradition and honor because everything he knows about Klingons came from books**

Worf grew up with humans and learned everything he knows about his people from books and holovids. That's why he has such a skewed view about what Klingon culture is supposed to be like.

This resulted in him becoming a paragon of what the stereotypical Klingon is supposed to act like. Klingons both admire and hate him for it.

**Worf was in command of one of the Birds of Prey in Yesterdays Enterprise despite not appearing on screen.**

nuff said

**K'Ehleyr had a similar fate in the Mirror Universe**

K'Ehleyr was half human and therefore an outcast in the Mirror Universe as well. She also had Worf's son, but Mirror Alexander is a total badass. Who has the Best Fan Theories?"

startrek,"I’m only like 7 or 8 episodes into the series but I have to say one think I like about it is that they made it to look like it came before TNG and the other shows that came before it. 

Except for TOS obviously bc the technology just wasn’t there back then. But the visuals, the sets all look like they came before TNG, DS9, and Voy. Which is fitting considering this show is set before all of them. 

That being said, do I love the way SNW is being done? Yes. Do I wish they had made it look like it came before TOS? No. 

I’m a Gemini, hence the inability to feel the same way about both shows. Enterprise show look opinion."
startrek,"I have been around since the original Star Trek, and I have seen plenty of strong female and diverse characters. 
I agree with older episodes not always being very responsible with cultural approaches, but recent series have sacrificed good character development and story telling, for social agendas. 
Discovery was all about women empowerment and it seemed almost the entire crew was LGBT. 
Nobody followed any protocol and it felt like a great story was riddled with characters who never could meet an actual Star fleet standard. 
Picard had the Admiral overshadowed by female characters who broke protocol but the few male characters were portrayed as clumsy and inept. Hell, it felt like Jean Luc was an afterthought. 
Stange new worlds is heading in that direction. Women lying to get into star fleet, the whole bridge is women. The show has an entire episode during which it removes the main male characters just to have a “woke” episode. And it’s all chaos. Representation done wrong"
startrek,"I’m in kind of a depressed mood. From any series, what is an episode that makes you feel better when you’re feeling down Need some recommendations for tonight"
startrek,"I know its blasphemous but hear me out.

Picard was captain for seven years on TV. He's featured in three more seasons in a show named after him *in this decade.*

Everybody loves SNW and Pike. I predict SNW will go on for the traditional seven seasons. Who knows, maybe more.

Meanwhile, Kirk was on TV for just three seasons over fifty years ago. On a show that has not aged well in many ways. It's safe to say that a sizeable percentage of fans from then are no longer with us. 

Kirk is the very first captain in the very first show of the franchise. The only captain portrayed on screen for over 20 years. This gave the character cultural staying power. (Yes I know about Pike in the Menagerie and Decker but c'mon you know what I'm saying).

BUT Prime Kirk has not been on screen since 1994. I view the Kelvin movies like the Blade and Underworld movies. Made a whole lot of money at the time with no resonance in the present. I don't think most fans would care if there was never another Kelvin movie.

I'm not saying that people are going to literally forget the name of Kirk. Most will still know him as the OG captain. But over time will his prominence fade? 

I see him as the Adam West version of Batman. Sure people know about West's portrayal but most fans would not choose him as their favored Batman. Even though he was the sole face of Batman for 20 years. In light of SNW, will Kirk become the least prominent Enterprise Captain among fans and in popular culture?"
startrek,"Episodic format with more time to get to know the bridge crew. That's what i want. No more world-ending stakes.

I really think season 4 was the strongest of them all. Getting rid of some characters like Mirror-Gorgiou and getting Tilly to ""settle down"" was a good move, I don't feel their characters where going anywhere. Also, did anyone else notice how the exaggerated emotional scenes sort of calmed down a bit during the latter half of the season? I also loved the 10C plotline, having Discovery actually doing some discovering and using science and clever thinking to solve their problems felt really satisfying.

What I'm saying is basically: SNW is amazing so far and i want Discovery to learn from that. What's the right direction for Discovery Season 5?"

2) I'm confused on the gene modification situation with the federation (what a rhyme!). So I know it was outlawed on Earth and with human governments, but in ENT, didn't Dr. Phlox say it was common for Denobulans? Why are other Federation members subject to this? I suppose when forming the Federation, this might have been a stipulation made by Earth and the other founding members thought it peanuts compared to other issues and went with it. It could be why some of the other species at the summit hadn't joined initially (like the Denobulans and the Rigellians). Just curious. 2 questions regarding SNW ep 3 (spoilers)"

startrek,"From humanity during the Earth-Romulan War?

Only identifying what a Romulan looks like in the 23rd century, instead of 22nd.

I can understand reasons that include the Romulans not wanting to be seen via communication screens or using other aliens during ground war, to avoid close encounters.

But what about dead bodies from space battles?  Its hard to believe that in the 4 year long war, Starfleet never picked up a frozen body from a destroyed Romulan ship.  I'm sure the Romulans worked on preventing starfleet and her allies access to their destroyed ships/dead, but its surprising that was 100% effective in the chaos of war.

Maybe there were some humans during the war that realized what Romulans looked like, but were killed before the news could spread. How were Romulans kept hidden?"

Everytime they reference an event from a recent Star Trek show, or reference a major character from previous Star Trek shows in the recent years, it takes me out of the show.

Coupled with the look of focus and raw youthful confidence of the excellent Melissa Navia it all combines to blaze new territory in what a Star Trek TV show can do.   Or at least approach what we see the Rocinante do on the Expanse.  

The father/daughter dynamic they seem to be setting up with Pike is refreshing and interesting as well.  The entire cast is very solid but even as an old man I feel like Navia is killing it as this new character. Ortegas Evasive Maneuvers"

I didn’t get into TOS until I was a bit older

First Contact is my personal favorite out of any Trek movie. It seemed to have a strong focus throughout the entire film, The borg presence actually felt like a real threat, and the two main plot points wove together so well. It was just a solid Film.

Insurrection IMO is the weakest of the 4 and probably the one I have grown to look at as more of a extended episode of a Star Trek season than a movie. 

Nemesis is my third in line, it’s not an incredibly strong film, but the story seemed much more fleshed out than it’s predecessor and a good amount of character development was done to really help explain Shinzon and his motives. 

I’ve recently been going back through all the movies and watching them in order ever since Picard season 2 ended and Strange New Worlds began.

I’ve got to say I’m quite thrilled with the Star Trek resurgence and enjoy it all so very much.

-How much sense does it make to watch The Cage at the very beginning considering both it being the original pilot episode, and it’s footage being repurposed in The Meangerie?

-Has the original version of Where No Man Has Gone Before (officially referred to as Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" – The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode) received any digital release, or is it locked to the TOS Season 3 Blu-Ray release? In relation, how different is the original version to the released version?

I'm not saying this to defend New Trek or to demonize Old Trek, I just want to talk about this. Say what you will about New Trek. Say it's bad (Cuz it kinda honestly is), say it's cringeworthy, say it's weird, even say it would be better in animation, cuz it's true most of the time. But one thing you can not say is that it betrayed Roddenberry's vision, cuz if you wanna blame someone for that, ya gotta thank DS9... Matter of fact, let's jump back a few years back to the early seasons of TNG.

Y'all remember TNG's first seasons, right? The campy acting, the dull plots and annoying jerk characters. But the thing that no one apparently remembers is that Gene actually wanted it to be that way! So according to him, apparently in the 24th Century humans evolved so much that they would have no inside conflicts with each other, no witty banter like the Kirk era or anything fun like that. 

In fact, humans were apparently so perfect that they could be arrogant jerks all the time AND THEY WOULD STILL BE IN THE RIGHT! Of course, this behavior changed in season 2, when Gene basically left, and it basically extinguished itself around season 3, and in seasons 2 and 3 we actually got a lot of stuff that was actually good! We got Riker's beard, we got Best of Both Worlds, we got Picard's family, we got Deja Q, and, of course, we got DS9. 

The point is, if TNG still kept going on Roddenberry's vision it would have gotten cancelled pretty quickly. Matter of fact, it's why it's such a miracle we got the 6 other awesome seasons of TNG to enjoy today! And if DS9 also stuck with Roddenberry's vision, it probably wouldn't have been as fondly remembered as it is today. So, remember that time when Gene Roddenberry almost killed TNG? Or when DS9 literally said ""Screw it""? Pepperidge Farm remembers"
startrek,I watched the entire series of TOS and TNG and loved it. I watched the first season of Discovery and Lower Decks and loved it. Also watched the original animated series and loved it. I can't get through the first episode od Deep Space Nine though. It's so boring to me. Does it get better? I can't get through the first episode of Deep Space Nine.
startrek,"My roommate says it gets worse. Is that true? I just got into a few episodes of season 4 so I don't know and I would prefer a plain answer rather than something that is spoiler heavy. BTW I can almost detect the antipathy that Kate Mulgrew had for that character. I just went through the episode where she bluntly tries to initiate sex with Kim and it made me roll my eyes. Look, Seven is hot but what made me watch voyager in the first place is that I just really liked Janeway. I haven't watched all of TNG but I really liked how she upholds her value system despite the situation that everyone is in, it's both challenging to me and satisfying to watch. 

Off topic but I accidentally started on the equinox episode and I got hooked so I started at the first season after that. The only thing I wish is that it wasn't so episodic because the show starts with a lot that don't seem to get resolved. I was disappointed that they didn't really do much with the Maquis or have a more structured story arc with the other caretaker. Also breaking up Neelix and Kes off-screen was disappointing to me because I wanted to see Kes taking the agency to do that herself and be more of a character beyond just being a nurse. Plus I just like Neelix as a character too so seeing him handle that would have been interesting to me. How is Voyager after Seven joins the crew? Also some general reflections on the show in general"
startrek,"So I’m watching my first Star Trek show, which is Enterprise. I just finished the Season 1 episode “Acquisition”, where 4 Ferengi rob the Enterprise and talk about capturing the women so that they can sell them on the slave market.

At the end of the episode, Enterprise retrieves their stolen goods and allows the pirates to leave, with a slap on the wrist.

I don’t know much about Star Trek but does Star-fleet have laws against killing or capturing hostile aliens? Can Star-fleet arrest criminals?"
startrek,"Given the fact that his ""Fate has been Sealed"" when he took the took the time crystal, does that mean that he is unable to die because of that (his only future is that of the accident). Can he therefore use this knowledge to take greater risks because he knows that he will live until the accident.

This idea was done in an episode of Red Dwarf (Season 8 - Cassandra) so I'm not expecting it to be a bit story plot but I thought that it was an interesting thought whether he is ""immune to death"" because of his fated accident or whether that ""Fate"" is merely the farthest his life could go and he could still potentially die in the interim.

Weird question I know but it was something I randomly thought of today Is Pike immune to death?"
startrek,"Greetings fellow Star Trek fans!

I've always been interested in the concept of the kobayshai maru ever since it was introduced in Star Trek ""lore"". The concept of the un-win-able test and how the Captain participating in the simulation is supposed to showcase how they deal with this. Of course, we all know that James Kirk cheated to beat the test and was commended for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

startrek,"We know from Worf's defeat of Gowron that you just challenge the Chancellor to single combat and take the throne if you win. It's very in line with what we know about Klingon society already, like how a first officer often becomes captain. Even the rite of succession ends in combat. 
So Kempec is old and fat and slow when we first see him. When we next see him he's being slowly poisoned. Basically anybody in the council could have defeated him. So why didn't they? Would it not be an honorable win? Was there too great a risk of civil war?

startrek,"According to Quinn, the Q Continuum been through the road of space and time countless times, they have seen it all, the Big Bang, ancient past, distant future and to the end of all things, the Q Continuum knows or at least has an idea of the outcome of every possible future imaginable.

The reason why the Q Continuum warns other Q about not messing with the Borg is because of Jurati and Voyager. For 400 years, Queen Jurati has been gathering strength, gathering volunteers to assimilate into a new benevolent Borg Collective, and Voyager is instrumental in defeating the older violent Borg and creating a power vacuum that would allow Jurati's Borg to take over the entire collective after the events of Endgame.

So, Q Jr messing with the Borg could have prevented the events shown in last episode of PIC season 2. ""Don't Provoke The Borg"" makes more sense now"
startrek,"I was just watching First Contact again for the first time in a while. I'm at the point where the Enterprise and the Borg have travelled back in time, and the Borg are building their communications array on the particle emitter. One of the Borg realizes something is up and gets up and after Hawke, who shoots the Borg. The Borg dead or alive then floats off into space -- in the past -- before Archer, Pike or Kirk ever even go to space the day before the Vulcans find Earthlings have discovered warp drive.   


This wayward Borg floating in this pre-federation space presents an opportunity for a show like ""Section 31"". A story could be built around a super secret Section 31 eyes only event where the Borg nearly took over the department. You couldn't do it with Strange New Worlds without breaking canon. If this Borg survived the phaser blast, then it is alive and floating in space, if it didn't it's still floating in space indefinitely. Either way this Borg is valuable for it's technology alone at this time and in this quadrant of space. So what do you think? Can a Borg survive apart from the collective? not to mention floating in space indefinitely? Would seeing the Borg in ST Section 31 be a deal breaker or something you'd look forward to?

startrek,"I'm rewatching DS9 again and when Miles O'Brien suggests Keiko bring Molly with her on a botanical expedition on post-war Bajor, I had a pretty strong reaction. 

I'm not saying it's impossible, even weighting the environment of DS9 against the unknown environments of Bajor where Keiko might end up, just the rapidity of O'Brien chucking his first born down to the surface of a planet without any hint of qualms left a bad taste in my mouth.

If you add in the context of the episode, with Keiko's malaise regarding giving up her career and then losing her school, it's even more frustrating. Miles suffers no disturbance in his own arrangements, but Keiko must maintain her domesticity even as she searches for renewed purpose in life.

startrek,"As the title says I’ve been watching Enterprise for the first time and while there’s been a couple of lesser episodes here and there, for the most part I’ve really been enjoying it. The NX-01 is awesome, and I love seeing the crew navigate the galaxy before they had all of Starfleet’s protocols to rely on. 

But Twilight was just…incredible. 

It might just be me being a sucker for episodes with alternate realities/futures where everything’s a bit grim and all hope is lost, but it felt like a really good blend of TNG’s Yesterday’s Enterprise and Future Imperfect. 

So, yeah, just wanted to rave about it for a minute because I honestly really, really enjoyed it. The NX-01 leading a convoy of refugee ships, Captain Tucker, the scene where Archer is told what happened to Earth, Travis getting unceremoniously killed off and no-one even mentioning it, all great stuff. I’ve been watching Enterprise for the first time and just seen ‘Twilight’. It was top notch, by far my favourite episode of Enterprise yet"

I understand the guy might be controversial, but when SpaceX sends people to mars- that will be a very important moment in human history. I certainly don’t agree with everything Elon Musk says, but he is contributing more personally than any other single person to make the human race an interplanetary species. It seems like Star Trek fans would be a fan of the human race becoming a multi-planet dwelling species. I Have just noticed that recently when beeping discovery related posts. Thoughts?

Many have wondered if M'Benga was demoted.  I don't believe that's the case.  With his knowledge on Vulcan anatomy, we could surmise that M'Benga is stationed aboard Kirk's Enterprise as a consultant, to instruct Bones and his medical staff on xenobiology.

startrek,"So I'm working on a Star Trek story where a small star starship (like 75 - 100 person crew) is thrown back in time and crashes on a planet during its' bronze age.    


Now there are 2 complications to this situation. Firstly is where and when they crashed, relative to the evolution of the culture of the planet. Basically, imagine if Voyager crash landed 100 miles from the Battle of Thermopylae.     


Please note, I am **NOT** saying that this story takes place on earth or that the ship crashes in ancient Greece. I'm simply referencing the Battle of Thermopylae as a general equivalent for the point in the development of the cultures of the region.     


The second complication: The ship had recently captured a group of Nausican Pirates and they were being held in the brig when the ship crashed. The Nausicans revived before the Star Fleet crew and managed to escape.  The reason this is a complication is the leader of the group figures out what happened and that they've been thrown back in time a couple of thousand years. So he decides to make the best of it and begins working to establish a new Nausican Empire, well in spirit anyway. Obviously eventually these Nausicans will die off and they can't breed with the natives. The Nausican leader is just smart enough, and knows just enough, that with a couple of thousand-year head start, a couple of phasers, a tricorder or two, and even a rudimentary knowledge of the development of cultures and technology he can ultimately steamroll the native warlords and generals that would oppose him if he gets a couple of years to establish an economic and logistical base while he can easily entice the majority of other Warlords to join him.      


Let me clear about a couple of points: 

1. leaving the planet is not an option. The damage to the ship is pretty severe and the crew does not have access to the materials or tools to basically build a new drive section. They do not have any shuttles.  
2. Isolation isn't really viable for the Star Fleet crew. They crash in what is basically the most populated area of the world at this time, and they crashed next to one of the largest wars the planet had known up to that time. The only way to really isolate would involve hoofing it a couple hundred miles to the north which would require provisions, which would mean interacting with the locals... which would kind of defeat the purpose. Without the provisions, such a trek would effectively be a suicide march.  
3. I'm envisioning the Nausicans to be utterly brutal. Slavery, rule of might, strength of arms determining legitimacy, etc. They use all those sorts of things to build their empire. They're not interested in 'co-existing' with groups that don't share their worldview, and they view the last 300 years of Nausicans being reduced to pirates and thugs for hire as a personal insult that they intend to prevent from happening again.  
4. Initially the Nausicans are lead by a Ferengi who basically intends to do what Quark talked about doing in 'Little Green Men'. I am not saying he is nice; he does use underhanded negotiations, predatory business arrangements, and manipulations to start what he intended to be the foundation of a vast financial empire. Ultimately he underestimates the Nausicans and is removed from power (Killed? Escapes and joins with the Star Fleet crew? \*shrugs\*. Donno yet.) As I said, I am not defending the Ferengi as being nice or good. Simply establishing that for all the terrible things he does and sets in motion, the Nausicans are ten times worse.   

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my question: what do you think Star Fleet's prime directives would say about this sort of situation?   

&amp;#x200B;

If you were the captain of the Star Fleet ship, what would you do? I'm pretty sure there is a section in the Temporal Investigations field book about this sort of thing."

startrek,"**Modern Star Trek has forgotten optimism which made the franchise great.** In modern society now, there's a feeling of pessimism. The days are truly past when humans perceived future with a sense of hope, now there is a sense of fear. The future is a place full of unknown, half formed terrors, while gradually becoming aware the evils of the past have stayed with us - prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, hatred - and the new Star Trek series' ethos has shown *it's no longer confident humanity can beat these challenges.*

Science-fiction has always served to showcase contemporary society, where sci-fi worlds may be fantastical, however they allow us all to understand contemporary issues. Symbolic of this, the last decade or so has given rise to dystopian futures, particularly geared towards a young adult audience. Oddly enough, these are performing better in the written form than they do in film and TV. These stories are actually quite subtle because they present bleak futures all too believable, and yet typically show a new generation confronting these ominous world systems. They are a strange blend of darkness and optimism because they at least suggest broken societies can be changed.

Given this context, Star Trek should be one of the most crucial sci-fi franchises of all. Gene Roddenberry knew how sci-fi worked, and **he believed his franchise had the power to confront and even transform society.** Unfortunately, the current writers and showrunners (and Hollywood in general) have struggled to present the same optimism.

Roddenberry was a humanist, and his optimism shaped Star Trek, by presenting our potential future, one where ***humanity had grown beyond petty segregation and self-interest.*** **Roddenberry's Star Trek declares humanity's best days are not behind us, they are ahead of us.** Star Trek (OS in particular) does not harp back to a romanticized, nostalgic portrait of yesterday. Also the values of tomorrow do not include nationalism, financial prosperity, identity politics, 'ism' ideologies, or power fantasies. There are still issues, but they arise from individual humans who are not ""elevating"", rather than from the system itself. This runs completely counter to modern pessimism - fear of the future, a nagging doubt about society's development. *Star Trek has become science fiction as counter-culture.*

**Unfortunately modern Star Trek, and a lot of shows remakes/sequels, have forgotten optimism, their roots and how to captivate the audience.** For example Star Trek Discovery showed the Federation at its worst, essentially modern society writ large. The idea of development and growth was no longer there, to the point the Federation considered an act of genocide. Worse still, the USS Discovery in the future is a lot more dystopian. Basically suggesting the Federation wasn't all great so did not last and is gradually being consigned to the history books.

Meanwhile, Picard season 1 was a story of nostalgia, with a corrupt Federation shown as villains at worst, antagonists at best. Picard desired doing good however he had failed and went into retreat mode. Even when Picard finally took to space again, he was driven more by a desire to do one last good thing than by a belief in the Federation. To make matters worse, his crew headed off on new adventures, independent from the Federation, perhaps still reluctant to trust an organization compromised by prejudice for decades (of course we know this never happened) effectively rewriting the history books. **Roddenberry believed in the slow march of forward progress**, he did not believe the future would flourish if we rewrote the past to try and appease or address a contemporary issue.

If the writers of modern Star Trek had any appreciation for science fiction, they would at the very least, get the continuity correct. It’s one thing to mess up the plot to ""refresh"" Star Trek for a modern day, mainstream audience. While personally this notion is completely unnecessary, you can at least get onboard with the idea. One cannot however have any respect for their complete lack of effort to ensure the principles, story and every other piece remained canon. They didn’t even do the easy stuff, like make technology remotely conform to pre-Kirk era Star Trek. If a science fiction writer with half the talent had actually done any research, this would be the first thing they did.

The writers and TV showrunners of today give us two options - ***they can appeal to the fans they have, offering a niche product which accommodates a smaller but very loyal fanbase, or ignore those fans and try to grow the fanbase in the hopes (hopes!) of bringing in more subscribers.*** In other words, they could settle for a small but loyal number of subscribers, or be greedy and bet the farm on trying to win over a large number of subscribers at the risk of turning away the loyalists. Guess which one they chose? Go on and guess! You guessed it, they chose the latter and failed heavily. *Furthermore, now in the show we get melodrama on all fronts!*

**When it comes to science fiction, Star Trek was always a space opera, but one with roots in hard science fiction.** This was always the fun of Star Trek. While we know a warp drive or replicators don’t really exist, the science is all there. It’s a big part of what enabled Star Trek fans to imagine a brighter future and even inspire future astronauts and scientists.

*""So in terms of sort of key influences, well I mean I certainly like Star Trek, because it actually shows like more of a utopian future, like it's not like, things aren't horrible in the future."" Elon Musk*

Who remembers Capt Kirk and Spock in gangster outfits? **""Kirk - Now you cooperate wid us and uh maybe we'll cut choo in fo a piece o dee action. Spock - A minuscule a very small piece.""** Effortless, the stories were striking and chemistry between characters was phenomenal.

The idea humanity will one day travel among the stars, discovering new life and new civilizations, boldly going where no one has gone before is a concept filling the world with the hope of a better tomorrow. The kind of tomorrow Captain Kirk was a part of. OS forever. To boldly rewrite history and make science fiction counter culture..."

startrek,"Seriously, what was it??? It added absolutely nothing to the story line. If the timeline was directly about Picard's lineage changing, then OK, that's something with some substance. But in this case, her mission affected everyone centuries from  now. '

I thought we were going to learn a lot more about Picard's history. That she was going to find out who he was and what her legacy would lead to or something. But as far as I can tell, they could've named her Renee Delpy and not a single thing in the story would've been lost. It just felt like another lazy way to building more connections but not to actually tell a compelling story. 

And we didn't need Zefram Cochrane related to Riker to be more invested in his story in First Contact, so we didn't need it here either. What was the point of Picard being related to Renee Picard in season 2?"

startrek,In an episode of the orville gordon malloy makes a reference to crack house ships.  So it got me thinking.

And they made pot brownies. And statements were made that the whole crew is on drugs.  So what would a ship look like where the entire crew is on mind altering drugs. Drug use in space

startrek,"So I'm an old TOS fan, watched some but not a lot of TNG and maybe 3 movies. So not a super or current overall fan, please take it easy on me if I'm stepping on toes. 

Recently I've been made aware of the debate with regards to a serialized vs episodic format, specifically in regards to comparisons between old Trek and NuTrek. (not to mention a difference in tone, dark vs not so dark) Being an older TOS fan, and also recently enjoying the Orville, I could say I certainly appreciated my Star Trek episodic over serialized and certainly less dark rather than overly dark. 

HOWEVER... I'd never seen DS9.  But someone was raving about it at work so I thought I'd give it a shot and aside from it being absolutely rave-worthy, (as an old TOS fan, the tribble episode had me worried but ended  up loving it, so well done!) I was very surprised at the serialized undergirding of the whole series and more importantly the full on serialization of a big chunk of the show from the middle of the 5th season to the middle of the 6th (not done yet, not sure how long it goes on for) and how dark it got (hello, S6E6 Rocks and Shoals, I'm looking at you).

The upshot being I guess I don't mind serialized or dark Trek. I guess, as it most things, execution matters. Serialized vs Episodic my 2 cents"

startrek,"As a lifelong fan of TNG I have had to deal with makeup redesigns of Klingons multiple times.  Luckily, each series  explains the differences in their storylines.  But for a long time I had to accept ST:TOS  Klingons looking different from ST:TNG because of production makeup costs and not because of an in-universe explanation.  ST:TOS looking different than ST:TNG has been explained in canon but so far no reason has been given to explain ST:DIS Klingons looking different (or JJ Abrams Klingons looking different in the Kelvin timeline, the timeline divergence from the Prime timeline alone is not a sufficient enough explanation).  So this is how I have come to rationalize why ST:DIS Klingons and JJ Abrams Klingons look different.  And also explain why the movie Klingons in Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country also look a little different.
As we all know, each of these different types of Klingon is due to different makeup companies doing Klingon prosthetics across the different productions of Trek.  But my in-universe canon explanation is that Klingons are composed of a Primary Klingon Species originating on Qo’noS, and at least two subspecies of Klingons originating on worlds near Qo’Nos we have not seen yet in Prime timeline Trek.
The Primary Klingon Species from Qo’noS has been the only Klingons shown in any iteration of Prime timeline Trek including ST:DIS(I will explain shortly).  We know from ST:ENT episode “Broken Bow,” the first encounter with the Primary Klingon Species looks like ST:TNG Klingons.  As explained in ST:ENT episode “Affliction,” the Klingons were experimenting with human Augment DNA which got loose in their population as a virus causing their population to get infected and take on the smooth-headed Klingon appearance seen in ST:TOS.  I totally bought this and it was a great episode of ST:ENT in its last season to fix canon before cancellation.  
The Augment Virus spread through the entire population of Qo’noS making them all smooth-headed Klingons.  The Klingon Empire as we know is governed by the Klingon High Council.  The High Council is only composed of heads of the great houses of Qo’Nos, the houses who are regarded as having the most honor.  There is a whole tier to the Qo’Nos population that belong to the Lower Houses, who have little to no power in governing and are considered of lesser honor.  There are also the lower Servitude Class who are considered without honor.
We have seen some scientists and doctors in Klingon society, but the majority of Klingons dedicate their lives to gaining honor as warriors.  The Klingon High Council is a total kleptocracy and, using ships and technology obtained after repelling Hur’q invaders in Klingon Ancient times the Great Houses, conquered species off world and further acquired more ships and technology.  By ST:ENT 22nd century time frame the Great Houses have already gone through their Hur’q ships since they were ancient and Klingons had no way to repair or make new ones.
Between ST:ENT and ST:DIS the Great Houses conquer Klingon Subspecies 1 somewhere far from Federation borders.  Klingon Subspecies 1 look exactly like ST:DIS Klingons: big heads (normally bald), pointy fingernails, weird necks.  Not like the ST:TNG we had seen in ST:ENT up to this point.  The Great Houses considered Klingon Subspecies 1 a worthy adversary and with honor; not enough honor to ever belong to the Great Houses but enough honor to be higher than the Qo’noS servitude class.  Klingon Subspecies 1 had driven off Hur’q invaders  and still had working Hur’q ships and the Qo’noS Great Houses took them for their own and seen in ST:DIS Battle of the Binary Stars and through its season 1.  
Also, at this time the Great Houses looked at Klingons with smooth foreheads as without honor, and with disgust because of the resemblance to humans.  When the Great Houses conquered Klingon Subspecies 1 they also obtained technology to reset their genome, but the technology was limited to only setting a patients genome to Klingon Subspecies 1.  Klingons in the Great Houses had the means to alter their genome to appear like Klingon Subspecies 1 which they preferred over looking like humans.  For a longtime it was how the Great Houses distinguished themselves from the less honorable Lower Houses and the servitude classes of Qo’noS.  
But as we saw in ST:DIS episode “Point of Light,'' Klingons began building an Imperial Fleet of D7 battle cruisers that we are familiar with from ST:TOS.  I would like to think the D7s came from a species the Klingons conquered (and maybe partially conquered by the Romulan Empire explaining why we saw Romulan D7s in ST:TOS). The Imperial Fleet is composed of crew not from the Great Houses who still have their own fleets, but from smooth fore-headed Klingons from less honorable, weaker Lower Houses and servitude classes of Qo’Nos that the High Council built as a defense force in response to their losses in ST:DIS season 1.  
This is where I would like ST:SNW writers to address this.  Sometime during ST:SNW timeline, Klingons of the Great Houses acquire technology to reset their genome back to  their original ST:TNG looking selves.  Firstly, only the Great Houses have this technology; Lower Houses and servitude Klingons on ships in the Imperial Fleet serving as the Klingon Defense Force are all we have encountered in ST:TOS (hence only smooth fore-headed Klingons).  But as years progress more Klingons in the lower ranks get access to this medical technology and revert their appearance back to ST:TNG Klingons.  This could explain why Kore, Koloth, and Kang KDF Klingons with smooth foreheads in the ST:TOS by the time of ST:DS9 appear with forehead ridges again.  This can further explain why Klingons in Star Trek: Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country the look slightly different from ST:TNG Klingons.  It takes multiple treatments, the first few treatments are susceptible to slowly reverting to smooth Klingon headed foreheads due to remaining effects of the Augment Virtus in the Klingon population.  That would explain why Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek Undiscovered Country had less pronounced forehead and nose ridges compared to Chancellor K’mpec in ST:TNG episode “Sins of the Father” since by ST:TNG the Augment Virus is pretty much eliminated from Qo’noS'.
I like the idea of a Klingon subspecies, it also helps explain why JJ Abrams Kelvin timeline Klingons look the way they do.  The Kelvin timeline Klingons (we have seen) are actually Klingon Subspecies 2, also conquered by Primary Species Klingons from Qo’noS.  However, unlike Subspecies 1, Subspecies 2 is regarded as having little to no honor by the Great Houses of Qo’noS; hence their place in the Klingon Empire as primarily Ground Troops which we haven’t seen in any of the Prime universe shows and movies.  Since Klingon Subspecies 2 have never served in the Imperial Fleet as part of the Klingon Defense Force, we have never seen them encountered by Federation Starfleet crews in the Prime timeline  and the only time we saw them depicted was as ground forces on Qo’Nos is in the Kelvin timeline in Into Darkness (excluding the JJ Abrams Star Trek 2009 cut scene). 
Subspecies are nothing new in Star Trek.  We know Remans are a subspecies of Romulans (or as I like to think of as a subspecies of proto-Vulcans).  Vulcan, Romulus, and Remus were all populated by common proto-Vulcan ancestors. We have also seen the Aenar, a subspecies of proto-Andorians.  Though not from canon, I would like to think of the Federation aligned Caitians as a subspecies of proto-Kzin (just like their Klingon serving sibling species the Fehreki in Star Trek Online).  The three Klingon species in Star Trek all derive from a common proto-Klingon species, an idea of proto species is they could have populated worlds before being warp capable.  The next question is: How were they dispersed across different worlds?  STO: Preservers?  Maybe by ST:TAS Slavers?  The idea there could have been explained by advanced races like Preservers and Slavers moving bipedal humanoid species around post Progenitors has tons of story potential.
I apologize if this is a long-protracted explanation, but for me this backstory is the most complete to explain all iterations of Klingons we’ve seen in Trek.  My only hope is that in ST:SNW we begin to see an explanation for ST:DIS versus ST:TNG and ST:TOS Klingons.  It does not have to be a complete explanation, but some hints dropped here and there in season 2 and beyond.  
From the leaked photo of the Undiscovered-Country-looking Klingon in season 2, I would hope the ST:SNW writer's explanation aligns with my thoughts.  I think my theory of three species of Klingons in the Primary timeline is sound, and that the Primary Klingon Species on Qo’noS originally looked like ST:TNG Klingons but because of the Augment Virus and later by genome resequencing to look like Klingon Subspecies 1, we have seen a total of 3 main Klingon looks in Prime timeline trek.

It really started me thinking about why the symbionts are treasured on that world far more than any Trill. It’s strange.

Were the symbionts there when the Trill population settled/evolved on the planet? If so, what about the matter of sentience. It seems that the Guardians are able to understand symbionts through some sort of telepathy, but it’s not something that everyone can do. How did they communicate the desire to be joined to a host, and why? What does the symbiont get? My best guess is that they get to experience life in a humanoid body- they wouldn’t be able to explore their world if they were stuck in an underground pool. What does the host get? Memories, more confidence, knowledge?

It seems like a mutual benefit, but it still doesn’t explain why the symbionts are globally seen as more important than their host. It’s just such a weird stance to take. What event could have been responsible for that to have happened? Why do the Trill hold the Symbionts in such high regard- even so far as to value the life of the symbiont over the life of the host?"

Problem solved.  Alternatively you could strap a nova weapon to it and destroy the local sun causing a supernova.  But that is a little excessive.

Con - the shields take fire that would not have otherwise hit the ship because they extend out far beyond the hull

Hull Shields

Basically everything in reverse. There is more likely to be hull damage if the shields aren't able to entirely stop incoming fire. You cannot extend your shields to protect another vessel. But the plus is that your shields only drain taking fire that would have otherwise hit the ship.

Out of universe people have complained that Picard lacks a commanding presence and is not the ""hero"" from TNG. In universe it is likely that deconstructions of Starfleet legends is very popular. But TNG have a lesser degree of deconstruction then Picard. Star Trek Picard is also likely an anti Luddite allegory, this genre  is also seen in the 32nd century with Owo's backstory.  The in universe writer also appears to have a strange interest in Laris.

If you are hesitant to start a new show, this is a good one to try. Strange New Worlds is my intro to new Trek"

startrek,"I seem to be reading loads of negative comments regarding Discovery and Picard. I'm curiuos to know why? I've seen pretty much everu episode of all franchises and enjoyed almost every one.
I liked Picard due it's change of pace and the introduction of genuine mystery. Discovery I thoroughly enjoyed! Exciting, twisty, great effects and first class cast and acting. The characters I found to be engaging and stories interesting. 
Can explain to what I'm missing?

Matt Why the hate?"
startrek,"I loved Janeways cameo in nemesis but thought it was funny how she became admiral before Picard. I mean, she deserved it considering everything she went through on Voyager. 

I think made me think it was funny is that was Voyager her first command. But then I think that went into her becoming an admiral so quickly after she got back. It was her first command and she went through all that shit. 
Mouth still funny it happened before a Starfleet veteran like Picard. Janeway cameo in Nemesis"
startrek,So yeah I got a subscription for paramount through Amazon prime. Season 1 looks HD. Season 5 looks horrendous. I compared it to the paramount app on my phone with my old prescription through them and it looks way better. I just Hate paramounts app..anyone else notice this? Star Trek TNG season 5 looks SD instead of HD
startrek,In strange new worlds it's long before they upgraded the transporters to prevent transporter psychosis.  So what if during the show someone actually gets it.  It would be an interesting episode.  And make everyone else hesitant to use the transporter.  Honestly I'm suprised crazy transporter accidents aren't more common.  Imagine if they beamed someone up inside out.  I would hate to be the one to clean up that mess.  But what if someone really did get transporter psychosis.  Would that be a good episode? What if someone got transporter psychosis

startrek,You see a lot of examples of starfleet being incompetent.  And a lot of time the incompetence of captain's and admirals gets people killed.  The dominion war has lots of examples of that.  But then there is just general incompetence.  Let's be honest incompetence gets a lot of people killed in star trek.  So what if star ship capatain's and admirals did jail time for incompetent decisions. What if starship captains and admirals did jail time for incompetence
startrek,"I have the opinion the Talosians have a special interest in Pike much the same way Q has a special interest in Picard.  In other words, the Talosians are Pike’s Q.  I wouldn’t be surprised the Talosians eventually show up in SNW before he gives the Enterprise to Kirk. The Talosians are to Pike what Q is to Picard"

startrek,"I've read some contradictory claims online:

1) Picard season 2 violates canon by showing Wesley as a traveler.  These posts cite Nemesis where he appeared as a member of Starfleet at the wedding.

2) ST Picard does *not* violate canon because the one Nemesis scene that Wesley had was cut from the film.

So which is it?  The removal of that scene is confirmed, so what is the problem?  Did the wedding scene also show Wesley in the background wearing a SF uniform? Did Wesley Crusher appear in Nemesis or not?"

Is Coda  saying that all novels and TV series after Star Trek VIII: First Contact are in an alternate (prime) timeline?

If that is the case, then how do the Discovery and Picard series exist? If the Discovery and the Picard series are in the prime timeline, do we expect those characters to have had generally the same experiences that we've read about thus far? Or is everything completely different?  And we'll just learn about their histories from bits and pieces on the series?

Does anyone know if there are more planned novels that take place in the so-called prime timeline that happened after Star Trek 8?

Overall, it was exciting to read, I just didn't think that they needed to and it all like that. I would have liked to have seen some sort of jointly connected prime and subprime timeline. Questions (and spoliers) about Coda"
startrek,"Hello all. Just finished TNG leg of my first Star Trek voyage. Where to go from here? Continue the story of Captain Picard or the wider trek universe? Decisions, decisions. For context, I started my maiden voyage with enterprise back in December, then went on to TOS before TNG. Where to go from here?!"
startrek,"Okay, here are my thoughts on Star Trek Strange New Worlds episode 1. 

Warning: SNW spoilers ahead. 


I love Ethan Peck as Spock and Anson Mount as Captain Pike. Celia Rose Gooding is amazing as Uhura too. The human kiss between Spock and T'Pring confused me. I'm sure Vulcans can kiss the human way, but I thought they would also kiss the Vulcan way too. That seems to be lost in this show. I hope they will incorporate more Vulcan culture and rituals into the show. I liked the message of the episode-- to try to make peace instead of war. The special effects are also amazing! My Thoughts On SNW"
startrek,"I pretty much never get to see Trek episodes the day they come out; participation in the megathread doesn't really work for me.

So, I hope I wasn't the only one who noticed that the comet's tail was pointing in the wrong direction.

Otherwise, great episode. There were so many things they could have been dumb about (the Prime Directive, the nature of the comet, Uhura's abilities, ...), but they weren't dumb about any of them. SNW S1e2 - Concerning the Comet's Tail"
startrek,"Lots of spoilers 

Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love all Start Trek. From TOS to the animated series through TNG and all of the movies all the way up Discovery and Picard and now SNW. I love it all, warts and all.

But the effusive praise here so far for SNW is bothering me. In the three episodes so far all we have seen are retreads of old plotlines from other series. The Enterprise shows up to mediate a conflict on an alien world, the Enterprise shows up to help move a celestial body before it destroys some alien world, the Enterprise gets some sort of virus that affects the crew and almost destroys the ship. All done before.

And again, I like the show so far. But people here are giving it nothing but praise where the slightest bit of nonsense from Picard or Discovery gets multiple threads trashing those shows for ""not being Star Trek"" or ""not making sense"" or ""not being canon"". Meanwhile in the first episode of SNW we have a civilization that creates a ""warp bomb"" simply by observing what happened to Discovery. And then Pike solves a bitter global conflict by presenting a short PowerPoint about what happened on Earth.

Episode two is, again, just a rehash of old celestial body threatens to destroy a planet/civilization unless good old Star Fleet comes up with a last second solution. It's been done to death.

And now with the preview from the latest episode the crew catches some virus that threatens the entire ship. Hard to judge an episode from a short clip, but it certainly looks like it's a rehash of episodes from several other series.

Once again, I like SNW. But I also really like Disco and Picard yet they have been torn apart over and over again for the same kinds of things that we are already seeing in SNW. I know it's familiar because of the known characters and the serialization. And I'm ok with that. But let's not pretend that they're doing something special or original with it so far. Because they aren't. Strange New Worlds rose colored glasses"
startrek,"They presumably still have the set for La Sirena. Seven's put in command of the Stargazer, and La Sirena is, well... ""available"". 

If they were starting production on a Rios spinoff, they'd have to find some way to release Cabrera from Picard, which they did in ""Farewell"", which makes sense. There's no reason to have one actor standing at the sidelines of the upcoming TNG nostalgia show, while there's an opportunity for a show of his own. Also, aside from the Flight Attendant, he doesn't seem to have anything else he's working on. He seems to have a great fondness for both the set and the character.

Could we be seeing a Rios spinoff in the near future, set in the years between ibn Majid and Picard? Rogue Elements gave us a glimpse of this and life aboard a civilian ship sounds very refreshing. Could there be a Rios spinoff in the works?"
startrek,"I've really been enjoying Strange New Worlds (and star trek in general for the past few years), so I thought that I would look up other peoples opinions and reviews on the show. I began to see a pattern in the negative reviews that really shocked me. Namely the so called ""Woke casting"" and ""Forced Diversity"". It really felt like all these negative reviews were just a way for some people to be racist, and or sexist. And why? Because there are more women in the main cast?  just because they gave Uhura a backstory???  (I feel that that backstory was long overdue by the way.) And for the people saying the show is preachy, yes probably. Star trek has always been a bit preachy right? It has always been a way to speak about current problems in my opinion. I could go on and on but I think that you probably understand my point by now.

I found this really upsetting because I've always thought of the Star Trek as being a progressive universe and community. So I'm really wondering how you guys deal with this side of the fandom, because I find it to be very off-putting. About some reviews on Strange New Worlds. (and maybe Trek in general)"
startrek,"I’m currently watching the series finale of Voyager for the first time and I just had a thought. 

Idk if the Borg Queen through the ST universe has always been the same queen or if there have been multiple queens (I know the actresses have been different but I’m talking about the character), but I think it would have been really interesting if the Borg Queen turned out to be Annika Hanson’s mother, Erin.

startrek,"My wife got me this book from a used book store in Mishawaka Indiana a few weeks ago. Of course I was quite thrilled. 

Obviously, nothing in this book is canon. It's a work of fan fiction, albeit extremely detailed. Nevertheless I find it very interesting as an example of early Star Trek Fandom in the mid-70s. 

This was a time when TOS and TAS were literally it when it came to Trek. There were no movies or other shows. No Picard, no Enterprise refit. No Bajorans, Cardassians, Trill, or Ferengi. 

What's shown instead is a very different galaxy than what eventually took shape. There are numerous planets, political boundaries, governments, etc. That made no appearances in any of the canon material.

As a Trek fan who grew up in the 90s with TNG, this felt in many ways very alien to me, no pun intended. It kind of feels like reading the first draft of the first Star Wars movie knowing how what the franchise actually ended up becoming.

Anyway, here's the link: https://imgur.com/gallery/SVnH3BV 1975 Franz Joseph Technical manual highlights"
startrek,In about a decade he could tell starfleet to cancel the training mission that has those cadets on it.  Problem solved.  And have that ship checked for radiation leaks before it leaves space dock.  So he could avoid it. Pike could avoid the accident
startrek,"I don’t think it’s perfect, I think there’s definitely some parts I think they could have done better/didn’t conflict with canon, but overall it really goes back to the roots of, what I like to think was Gene Roddenberry’s vision. It’s optimistic, conceptually pleasing, and has good character development while still maintaining the stand alone episode vibe. I feel like there’s a lot of hate on the the newer Star Trek series—which I feel like is part of the problem. Being inspired Star Trek’s message, I personally like to take what I can get and look at the good things that have come out of modern Trek (I also genuinely really liked Lower decks). I think Strange New worlds is actually pretty good. What are people’s thoughts?"
startrek,"I have often thought that one of the worst decisions/routines the producers got into was destroying the Enterprise.  As I now watch SNW, and listen with new ears to the opening “these are the voyages of the starship Enterprise”, I’m reminded that the story is really about the ship.  Not the crew.  The crew is transient.  Whether Kirk, or Pike, or whomever, they are crew on the ship.  The Enterprise is the main character!  So they should never destroy her.  They can revamp, create new versions, but she should never ever be sacrificed, ditched on a planet, or rammed into a Romulan.  As Dr. McCoy said, if you take care of her she will always bring you home.  So please no more destroying the Enterprise please.  Thank you! The USS Enterprise"
startrek,"Back in my day I remember when new Star Trek shows aired on TV stations like UPN. Nowadays every new show is exclusive to a streaming service.

What's wrong with a good old fashioned TV set? I mean is there any reason they don't air these shows on TV as well in addition to streaming? Call me old fashioned but I still prefer watching shows on my television set than on the computer or cell phone. I mean I know I can bring them over to the TV but it's not the same.

Times have truly changed since the 90's. Why don't new Star Trek shows air on TV anymore?"

startrek,"I'm not really a noob to star trek. Been watching it off and on since I was a kid however i am a noob here and to the community and what they think about something i was wondering. I recently rewatched the Kelvin timeline jj Abrams movies (well the first 2 about to watch beyond  tomorrow) and was wondering if it's Canon in that spock and Nero got sucked i to the wormhole. Aka is the prime timeline dealing with that story whise or is that a plot hoke as far as the original timeline goes. Obviously kind of a dumb question i just haven't watched any of the new shows like discovery, Picard and new worlds. I know that new worlds and discovery are set before the events of spock and Nero but yeah has it been addressed? I'm rambling now... prime and Kelvin timeline question"
startrek,"I don't know about you Trekkies/Trekkers out there, but the new series is phenomenal. I have watched each episode at least 3 times and they both take my mind off a moment in my life that is difficult. I have just lost my grandfather these past days and somehow, the ideas of life and death from the pilot episode have somewhat prepared me for what happened.

I have watched all series, but I honestly believe that ST:SNW is one of the best Star Treks out there and will remain in a special place for me due to the dramatic period in my life I have watched it. The messages and ideas that have been put out in these 2 episodes have coincidentally been so very applicable to the grief that I am going through right now.

Thank you all for listening. Strange New Worlds calmed me down"
startrek,"I'm at season 2 episode 26.

While i enjoyed season 1 and most of season 2, I can't forgive some of the writing choices. 

Archer helping the klingon empire see the error of their ways while being the first human ever to set foot on kronos, all while being tried. ""Escaping"" the prison planet. More like walked out. The borg in the alpha quadrant already. I fast forwarded the borg episode and read the writer synopsis for the episode. I know he said he was trying to create a closed timeline with First Contact and Q Who. Still, what a crock, it didn't belong. What did it in for me though is when they added photon torpedos to the enterprise weapons arsenal. They've hinted at photon torpedoes being used by different races but even trip was like, never heard of photon. A few episodes later they have fully operational photon torpedoes in their ship. Give me a break.

This is no longer the pre-series they intended to make. I'll likely finish the series but I'm taking a break for a few days. difficulty continuing enterprise"
startrek,"I finished for the 4th time now, its the best of all shows especially as of season 4, the definitive number 1, TNG comes close but still. Loved Sisko more than Picard, Jake more than Wesley, WORF, the best character is the deuteragonist, Miles Obrien and Bashir are cool characters and so is Dax, I Love IT! Also loved Jemhahda, Dominion, Cardassians, GARAK;the list goes on and on and on .. Wow. Deep Space Nine really is the best series"
startrek,"Star Trek comics were one of my quarantine projects, and I’m starting to wonder if the SNW writer’s really dug into them too?

Uhura’s family dying in a shuttle crash (and I think even her not wanting to join  Starfleet) was pulled directly from the IDW Kelvin-verse comics—I don’t think this was a plot line before that?

A couple key plot points were also pulled from the Pike-led Early Voyages comics (which are SO GOOD if you haven’t read them)

This goes back to Disco but Pike being aware of his death due to a time anomaly was a plot point in those comics as well as him being a ranch with horses.

Anyone else notice plot lines borrowed from the comics, either in SNW or other new trek shows? SNW and Star Trek Comics"
startrek,"I remember someone posted somewhere that comet tails aren't trails from the comet but trails blown away from the sun. I saw this first comment from someone's criticism of DS9's opening scene. And now we have another comet in SNW.

startrek,"i loved the more recently movies, i love star wars, i love the expanse (the first season at least)... which seasons of star trek are more exploration, action and less drama and less like a soap opera kind of thing... are there any season that have the Mass Effect games feeling? PS: i tried to watch star trek discovery but that amount of drama, woke and so few battles was really boring... Wich star trek show are worth watching?"
startrek,"I liked the series Picard but after seeing the Borg assimilating and destroying millions of people from different species for years I can’t imagine a happy, helpful single Borg. I don’t think this ending did justice to the Borg. What are your opinions about a friendly Borg?"
startrek,"The shuttle accident Cadet Uhura mentions in E02 is BetaCanon to ATOS comics, as shared by Nyota to Spock during an intimate emafa kito. 
Seems like the divergence created by Nero's incursion to the timeline slightly altered the outcome of the shuttle accident that killed Cadet Uhura's parents in prime timeline, but only killing Raheem in the Kelvin timeline, consequently affecting her choice of Nairobi institute for Earth-Romulus war advanced studies. Cadet Uhura's origin story is lifted from Kelvin timeline comic, ST issue#18"
startrek,"I think Star Trek should create a spin off show based on the starship, USS Relativity. Since this is a time ship, this show could be a show based on Nostalgia. The show could use characters from previous shows without using the origin actors or actresses. It doesn't seem right to have anyone play the role of Spock, except for Lenard Nemoy. However, a cameo actor for Spock in this show be okay. USS: Relativity"
startrek,"I'm loving everything about the new series: the mystery of the week format, the camaraderie of the crew, the more measured tone closer in spirit to old trek.

BUT, I can't get behind how small the Enterprise feels. The various space scenes involving the Enterprise, especially in the most recent Comet episode, make the ship feel more like a nimble fighter than the slow-moving large naval ships of series past. Now we don't have to go full JJ Abrams and make the Enterprise enormous, but I'd settle for Wrath of Khan. SNW and the Scale of the Enterprise"
startrek,"I was watching the episode where Odo joins with Curzon and realised the trill the changelings have a pretty amazing symbiotic potential you might not expect, 

Curious if there are any other examples or theories for other races out there? Best unexpected combos/symbiosis in species or cultures?"
startrek,"With this week's comet episode we've started a pattern where Sam Kirk does something risky on the landing party, gets knocked out and almost killed, which demonstrates risky stakes and focuses the rest of the landing party on the crisis.

Dramatically speaking, this serves an identical story purpose as the many individual landing party redshirt deaths, followed by McCoy's famous ""He's dead, Jim,"" accompanied by a dramatic music sting leading into the commercial break.

This time, using Sam to fill that role, they even had to resuscitate him, because his heart had stopped (he had, quite literally, died, Jim).

I think this trend should continue. Not only does it help maintain the classic story structure that fans have shown they're desperately in love with, it replaces a tacky repetitive trope having an awkward cumulative death count (that wouldn't play well with Pike's arc) with an adorable and lovable recurring gag, and a character trait for Mr. Kirk.

Also the idea of the guy in the landing party **whose name is Kirk** being the one who is at constant risk of danger and unfortunate happenings is in itself very amusing. Sam Kirk as the reusable redshirt is as clever as it is hilarious"
startrek,"So I'm really enjoying the new show, but I have a question...

In the opening monologue, Pike says the line ""It's ***Five Year*** Mission:""

I've been a fan of TOS since I watched them as a kid in the early 70's. I know this was the original premise of the show, but that was Kirk's mission. How is Pike's also a ""five year"" tour, if we are fully 11 years from James T. Kirk's tour?  That would mean the Federation's flagship is 12+-ish years old by the time Kirk takes the chair, depending on Stardate of build...

Seems kind of aged for the best ship in the fleet... SNW Opening Monologue Question..."

startrek,"Shamelessly stolen from [Sean Ferrick](https://twitter.com/seanferrick) on Twitter,  what awful ways are there to describe episodes of Star Trek but in a way that makes them sound twisted, horrific or mundane than they actually are.

Space Chandler drives so fast that he dies and turns into a lizard before kidnapping and mating with his boss

startrek,"&gt;!The 'shephard' aliens they encounter while at first glance seemed belligerent zealots, were gradually revealed to be actually right and a lesson learned for our starfleet crew. In a rare case for the franchise, starfleet was actually kind of wrong this time around and we see that Pike and crew might have been better off placing some more trust in the shephards. Mind you, the stakes were really high and they could not have known so I can appreciate that, but I found this to be a really nice touch that we had an advanced alien race (more advanced than humans), and at the end they were very reasonable and left peacefully. GREAT episode of Star Trek overall, loving SNW and hope this continues.!&lt; A small point which I really appreciated about SNW episode 2 ""Children of the Comet"" (Spoilers)"
startrek,"Just an observation and opinion. They are unemotional, (although they are profoundly smug and often passive aggressive), but their ""logic"" is more often than not just a means of justification of their preconceived notions and rationalizing their decisions. Vulcans aren't really all that logical"
startrek,"Just the fact that Strange New Worlds is so strong right out of the gate is both fantastic and annoying. While I still  of course enjoy Picard and Discovery, they both lack the  lightness that SNW has. It manages to have that little bit of seriousness while still having some humor. Just loved the whole dinner scene this week. Strange New Worlds being so good out of the gate makes me frustrated as a fan."
startrek,"Most of the main TOS cast appeared in following series / movies and the last time we saw the original Captain Kirk was in Generations. I'm sure they've could've find some way to introduce Shatner in recent Star Trek and he seems enthusiastic about it, but they never did. What do you folks think about this? What happened and why? Why did Star Trek abandoned Shatner?"
startrek,"But four episodes in I'm not even interested in watching the rest.. Did anyone else feel like this with season 3?
There's nothing about the story that's ""grabbing"" me.. I don't feel like I *want* to watch each episode like I do with SNW. Finally started Discovery s3"
startrek,If I was in his shoes and saw that vision of the future I would have retired from starfleet and gone planet side and never set foot on a starship again.  But he didn't.  His only concern was with how it would effect his command of enterprise.  He even said that he's willing to make that sacrifice to rescue those cadets.  So you have to give the man credit.  It's people like him who are brave and self less that give starfleet a good name. Pike is a brave man
startrek,Does anyone know if there are any non-human Starfleet Captains? I don’t recall any. But if course I could be mistaken. Non-Human Starfleet Captains
startrek,"In Strange New Worlds, it almost seems like there's more women than men on the bridge, which is fantastic. I just watched ""The Cage"" yesterday and Pike lamenting about women being on the bridge is somewhat difficult to accept. If there was any part of canon/continuity that needed breaking, it's that one. And yeah, Enterprise probably broke that with Captain Hernandez, although the crew of Enterprise was still 2:1 men. Sure, all subsequent movies and shows demonstrated otherwise as well, but I still think it's worth pointing out. We're fortunate that Pike has been retuned in that regard, and probably more so that he's more likeable in general.

What sorts of outdated canon do you wish they'd contradict? Women on the Enterprise bridge, the best broken canon yet"
startrek,"I have been enjoying Voyager so much more now that I’m finished watched with DS9. It’s like that show was so good it made Voyager look bad and made all the little things made me annoyed seem like they were so much bigger than they actually were. 

I just finished “Shattered” from season 7 and loved it. It was kind of like a best of episode. There were many months that made me chuckle too. 

And while I’m here, during the season 6 episode “Live Fast and Prosper” did anyone else notice this little detail… the woman that impersonated Janeway opened her jacket at one point while sitting in the captains chair. And the turtle neck was actually like a clip on or something. I thought this was a great little detail because we rarely see officers without their jackets and never knew what was underneath them. An episode or few before this one we do see Janeway without her jacket and see that it’s a full shirt underneath with a turtle neck. So the detail that the alien woman didn’t know that was funny because her uniform that the clip on thing. I just thought that was a cool little detail. 

I also found it interesting that during the Barclays hologram/free go episode no one asked why is uniform was different. Voyager"
startrek,"Picard was land based and plagued with violence this season. That is not Star Trek, nor star fleet. There’s was no boldly going anywhere or exploring anything in any recent iterations until this new series gave me a bit of hope. I had lost hope until “strange new worlds” brought back a old, familiar feeling of exploration."
startrek,"Just saying, I could see Bashir and Garak hot-boxing a runabout for sure. McCoy, especially when he had the beard and the 70s medallion. O'Brian? ""Jaysus, this Romulan kush should be illgal!"" I'm not sure if Vulcans would smoke pot or not, perhaps a small logical toke to help with meditation. What do you think? Which Trek characters do you think are secret stoners?"
startrek,"hello! i’m a non-binary lesbian poet and i recently put up a short collection of star trek fan poetry on gumroad. it focuses on TOS- the show, the creative team, fan culture (classic fan culture and also modern day twitter fandom), and my own relationship to it all in terms of sexuality and gender. if anyone is interested in checking it out and supporting a fan project, the link is below!

startrek,"After two episodes, I’m starting to think Mr Kyle is destined to become the second most important person in Starfleet history. The man has been instrumental in two missions in a row. Imagine what he can do if he ever gets to move from behind the transporter console. Mr Kyle"
startrek,"Title, I know they have officer pips out there, but what about enlisted pips? What rank design is cannon? I've seen a bunch but they seem to be fan design. where can i get Enlisted pips?"
startrek,We've finally got a show set in the original series era thanks to strange new worlds.  The question is will the redshirts drop like flies.  Red shirt deaths were common in the original series.  So now that the tos uniforms are back in style are going to see a lot of shirts die.  Let me know what you think in the comments. Red shirt deaths
startrek,"It always seems to just make everything harder for the main characters, is there any time the prime directive actually helps or makes sense? does the prime directive make any sense?"
startrek,"Sorry if that was triggering.


I have a serious question that I have wondered all my life about… well just about every Star Trek tv show or movie I’ve ever seen — and heck even The Orville —

I love these types of shows but I’ve never been one to take huge dives into the “lore” or whatever you would call it. 

My question(s) is(are),

Who mans the bridge of the ships at night or when the main crew is asleep? Do they just shut the ship down and have someone sit there and watch the bridge in case anything happens?

Or is there a 2nd shift and third shift crew?

Is the ship always traveling flying since it takes so long to get places? 

I’m assuming there is a night/secondary command crew (not led by a captain or first officer… so who leads that and what is their rank?) and if the ship runs into trouble they hold things down until the main crew can muster to the bridge?

Now that would be a great sci-if comedy… a show about “the other guys and gals” that have boring “night” duty and never do the fun missions like the main bridge crew but have to take over when they are off saving a planet or fighting somebody. Help me Trekkies, you’re my only hope."
startrek,"When I first saw the ship I thought it was an incredibly stupid and nonsensical design, even for what's supposed to be a comedy show, especially considering how it makes no sense how the turbo lifts could feasible get to the lower decks. But as I've given the show a second chance, which I also didn't care for, I've not only grown to love the show but the Cerritos and California class in general! What helped was Spacedock pointing out how it's meant to look like something that was kitbashed for a background shot in TNG. I still think it's ugly and shitty, but it's the kind that's got charm and character, just like the great state it's named after!

Yes I'm a Californian. At first I hated the design of the Cerritos, but I've learned to love it!"
startrek,"They started the episode with 8 minutes showing people eating and talking. The crew...eating...and talking about stuff...for 8 minutes! It was so refreshing to see actors just having a dialog, developing charters and acting. And they had a few of those moments. Whole segment on the surface of the comet was great and of course it was [Uhura and Spock who figured out that singing was the key](https://youtu.be/QDTS8U0Uawk). I'm still puzzled why they just suddenly removed their helmets at one point and I don't really buy [Spock slicing the comet with his shuttle](https://c.tenor.com/CbSB1GH8PgEAAAAC/larrydavid.gif), but otherwise it was a really solid episode. Also, an advance race that holds comets as deity is just cool. This episode belongs in the late seasons of TNG, 8.5/10. SNW S1E02 is the best Trek episode of all the new Treks, change my mind."
startrek,"I had this question on another post, but I thought I would make a mainline post question.

Pike saw his future. He died saving cadets. In that view of the future he had a full head of hair.

If he were to shave his head. Religiously.... Every day. Perhaps even go so far as to do the 23rd Century version of Laser Hair Removal to ensure it never grows back. Does that change his future?

If he has no hair, that means the future he sees cannot be 100% accurate. Therefore, nothing else can be assumed to be 100% accurate either.

Seriously... Change the hair... Change the future!! Pike / His Hair / The Future"
startrek,The voice of the computer. Even just one last time. she caught my breath. returning one last time to Star Trek in episode 2
startrek,"In the Star Trek Universe, obviously the Star Trek TV series never existed. This didn’t cause much of a difference until the late 90s when Star Trek Voyager never existed. Therefore, Jeri Ryan was never hired to play 7 of 9. 

In the real world, the stress and pressures of this role contributed to her divorce from politician Jack Ryan. Also, in the real world, sordid details about the divorce would come out when Jack Ryan was running for the US senate. He eventually dropped out of the race. Who ended up winning the seat he ran for? Barack Obama. In the real world, of course, Obama would rapidly ascend  to the Presidency from the Senate. 

In the Star Trek universe, Jerri Ryan never got a big role and never divorced Jack. Jack went on to win his senate seat and Barack Obama stayed an obscure Illinois official. 

In the 2008 Democratic primary, John Edwards became the anti-Hilary protest candidate. He went on to win the nomination and was at first a huge favorite to win the election against John McCain. Therefore, McCain still selected Sarah Palin as his running mate in a Hail Mary. 

But in an October Surprise, Edward’s mistress spoke out before the election and all of Edward’s malfeasance came out. He went on to lose to McCain. 

The stress of the office killed John McCain in 2 years. Sarah Palin became the president of the United States. And you can use your imagination from there. 

Thoughts? Fan theory about the divergence of the Star Trek universe from our own."
startrek,"Pike has frankly massive quarters, I'd guess ten times at least the size of Kirk's cute little room in the same ship a few years later and roughly the same size as Lorca's quarters and ready-room combined on the larger Discovery - which alread seems very spaciously designed. Saru and the Stametses - family -quarters also seem huge... 

There has always been a lot of cloudiness over the internal configuration of the ships in Discovery/SNW (let's not get into a conversation about THAT turbolift scene), but is there any kind of deckplan out there that actually references peeps into windows and other on-screen clues that explains just how all these rooms for around more vital facilities?

It might not seem important but my professional interiors brain kicks in when I see these amazing living spaces and immersio goes out the window... Espec when I start comparing to the more modest apartment Sisko had on the much less space limited DS9, not to mention the small but fuctional captains quarters in Voyager or TNG and the very realistic TOS and Enterprise shoeboxes. Officers Quarters."
startrek,"Nothing major--just maybe a message over an intercom paging Admiral Mariner to Conference Room Four*. Or maybe LaForge meets the others at a bar on a backwater outpost, and the bartender floats up and says, ""The name's Peanut Hamper. What's your poison?""


*Yeah, sorry Beckett--we can't all have happy endings. Picard Season 3 should include a Lower Decks Easter Egg"
startrek,Every last one. I just realized that changelings are all naked.
startrek,"Before you say some nonsense about the limits of prosthetics in makeup, I'm not buying it.  It's some kind of Q-spiracy or something.  But it's true...smallest heads in the whole damn universe.  

PS: Trill don't have heads Shower thought of the day...Star Trek humans have the smallest heads in the entire universe by square volume."
startrek,"From its inception Star Trek has always been full of music, often performed by characters in the show. While it usually involves the characters singing or playing and instrument, the opening themes for the shows are also incredibly iconic.

From TOS Uhura and Spock’s song, or a visit by the space “hippies”. 

To TNG for some smooth Jazz with Riker, or a string quartet with Data. 

DS9 brings some swing in with Vic Fontain, but doesn’t stop there with its Klingon Operas with Worf and Martok

Then of course in VOY the doctor masters opera, and Harry Kim keeps working on the clarinet 

Not forgetting to keep your Faith of the Heart in ENT

And now in PIC Queen Jurati belts out a song at the Gala. 

With all the music is there any song that stands out to you? A performance that you look back on fondly? Or are you a music buff who was impressed by some of the songs? What’s your favorite musical moment in Star Trek? What’s your favorite musical moment in Star Trek?"
startrek,"It's just awesome.
It's the only new show that feels like Star Trek to me, but with modern VFX.
I believe SNW will become the perfect entry point for people new to Star Trek.
Makes me happy :) I just wanted to share how much I like SNW so far"
startrek,"Was watching this last night, and there a million plotholes, but I was so confused about why Kirk agreed to bring Sybok and his supporters up to the Enterprise in a shuttle. I was expecting Kirk to have some plan to capture them en route or something but he just seemed to give up. Even Chekov in command of the 1701-A didn't know the terrorists were coming aboard.

Back on the show, they'd have probably used a code for Chekov and Kirk to establish everything was OK. They also made in very clear in the show and ST III that they'd rather blow up the ship than let hostiles take her over. So what gives? Why did Kirk ferry the terrorists aboard in The Final Frontier?"
startrek,"While on a survey mission, the U.S.S. *Enterprise* discovers a comet is going to strike an inhabited planet. They try to re-route the comet, only to find that an ancient alien relic buried on the comet’s icy surface is somehow stopping them. As the away team try to unlock the relic’s secrets, Pike and Number One deal with a group of zealots who want to prevent the U.S.S. *Enterprise* from interfering.

startrek,"Alright you Star Trek professionals.  My bf absolutely loves all the Star Treks and I have never gotten into them at all, but I’d love to be able to converse with him on this. So! Couple questions…where do I start? Should I watch them then way they came out or in chronological order?  What other info should I know?  TIA! Partner love Star Trek!"
startrek,"I have my answer, but I want to hear from you guys first. Yes, the Klingons talk a big game, but who is really the toughest species in Star Trek?"
startrek,So I just finished watching the Barge of the dead. I guess I realize it’s just Klingon myth… but it’s interesting that if anybody dishonored/disgraced the Klingon race and his Father its Alexander. Worf dies 4 times … we never heard about it before. Just saying interesting …something I was thinking about. Barge of the dead
startrek,"I just watched episode 1 again to get ready for tomorrow, and at the very end during the credits there is a fast paced version of the intro theme that I missed the first time:

I thought that was pretty cool and wanted to share for anybody else like me that missed it on the first watch 🙂 SNW: fast-paced version of the intro theme at the end credits 👍"
startrek,"Instead of a new series, they should make 1-3 original Star Trek movies or miniseries each year in the Next Gen era. New crews, new ships. Air them exclusively on Paramount+, and they can serve as de facto pilots for series if the reaction is positive. Paramount+ exclusive movies or miniseries"
startrek,"Right now, I think Paramount+ has a winning strategy having 4 Star Trek series in production.  Every week we get a new episode of Star Trek which keeps me subscribed to Paramount+ year-round.  Can't say the same yet for Disney where there are gaps between new Star Wars and Mavel series.  I'm sure this has been the strategy of Paramount+ all along and with Picard ending next year to keep the year solid with new Trek I would hope Alex Kurtzman and his teams are close to beginning production of yet another Star Trek series to air in the same year as Strange New Worlds third season and Discovery's sixth season.

So what would your preferred next Star Trek series be?  I personally want to see continuation in the prime timeline following the events of Picard.  I would love to see an Enterprise-F set series, possibly starting with Worf as Captain but then transitioning command to another captain in case actor Michael Dorn does not want to star on an ongoing series again.  Or a USS Stargazer series with Jeri Ryan as captain.  Episodic like how Strange New Worlds but with character arcs spanning episodes like the best episodes of Deep Space Nine did in the 90s.  As much as I love Strange New Worlds I grew up with Next Generation and the Star Trek universe I most appreciate is the timespan Picard is continuing following TNG-DS9-VOY.  For me that's the most lived in fully realized Trek universe over the Kelvin timeline and the prequel series and for me where I want to see more stories set in.  What's other people's thoughts.  I would hope the production of the next Star Trek series would start soon so we don't have gaps in new Trek in two years. After Picard what should be the next Paramount+ Star Trek series."

startrek,"This guy is billions of years old, has interacted with every race imaginable, has a **son** and the entire Q continuum.

And yet he's now dying and the only person he wants to share his final moments with is a primitive biped human he only met a few decades ago (which is probably like days to someone like this) and who also hated the guy for much of that time they knew each other. Q has not endeared himself to a lot of people in the universe when this is the closest person he says goodbye to after a billion or so years lol. 

That said, if you have to go out with anyone, Picard is a great choice! I feel a bit sorry for Q.... (Season 2 Picard spoiler)"

startrek,"I may try to pick it up but it just doesn't feel like Star Trek.  I miss the hopeful, positive, futuristic, exploration message that Gene Roddenberry created.  I wish they would bring it back.  I would love to see the Enterprise series completed. 5 Episodes into Picard and I cannot watch it anymore"
startrek,"Being a Trekkie I know im not the only one who see so many common factors in reality barring in space travel, things that are Trek derivative I just can help seeing or correlating. Like deuterium being an actual fuel for fueling the warp engines and our Plasma reactors. And Space X naming their rocket a ""Star Ship"". I just can't help it.
My latest common Trek take is the Orbital Ship ""Dream Chaser"" from Sierra Space looks so darn close to the fictional ""Renaissance"" in the Enterprise intro and recently finally making it's appearance in Picard season 2 finally telling giving us the story of the ship. 

I wanted to share this with other Star Trek fan in hoping you guys would make this correlation yourself and share with everyone things that you have noticed in the Trek universe that are in our real space lives today. Please feel free to share with me and everyone else your correlations  it would be fun I would love to hear them! Renaissance (OV-165)"
startrek,"Are y'all excited? 

I I'm really nervous just because it would be so hard to make a true Star Trek game that had all the nuances that I love in the TV show I'm really hoping for kind of oblivion but in Star Trek where you can run through the entire game completely passive not killing anyone or anything

 but what do y'all think? star trek resurgence"
startrek,"while my hubby likes it, I'm the bigger star trek nerd and I've been wanting to get into some hardcore nitty gritty convos about it lol. over the years, i only made one friend who was interested in talking about it. we only talked about TNG and voyager (he hadn't seen the others). I've seen about half of TOS, all of DS9, TNG and voyager. I also just finished watching disco. I'm halfway through season 2 of picard and watched the first ep of strange new worlds.

What's a girl gotta do to find some fellow star trek nerds 😭 I would love to have a little meet up if folks are interested... DM me and maybe we can plan something :) I have no one to talk about star trek with (new or old) in the bay area :("
startrek,"Or pictures combined with body language? The aliens had identical body language to humans, a fair amount could be communicated with that alone. A picture of both sides with weapons drawn, a picture of both sides with those weapons clearly put on the ground, a picture of both sides trading items.

startrek,"I just watched tos and tng for the first time and enjoyed them both.  I've started ds9, but so far it's not scratching the same itch.  That's not to say I'm not enjoying it, but it doesn't have the same feel to it.  

I like the semi light hearted optimism of tos and tng.  I like the exploration.  I like that each episode is it's own self contained adventure with familiar and consistent characters .  I like that there isn't as much overarching story or efforts to change and develope characters.  

As an example I'll use the x files.  I like the ""monster of the week"" episodes more than the episodes that tell a larger story about Mulder's quest. 

Are there any other comfortable, optimistic, feel good exploration shows or movies you'd recommend? looking for show recommendations."

***Debut  Performance.***  *Lights! Camera! Sabotage? While at NiqaCon, Cloudio,  Sinclair, &amp;  Skirmish investigate who's trying to ruin an artist's  chance at a grand  prize. But the search for culprits reveals a broader  conspiracy. Will  our heroes crack the case &amp; save the day?*

Plot Summary:

&gt;!Sabotage at Niqa-Con!  While Cloudio, Sinclair, and Skirmish are  discussing the dos and don'ts of guild meet and greets with the talented  Joyful Babette her fellow artist Quixotic bursts into the auditorium  declaring that their gorgeous costumes have been ruined with only a few  hours before the start of the Niqa-con talent show! (With a grand prize  of 20,000 gold pieces to the winning party).  Suspecting foul play the  group searches for clues but comes up with only a pair of leads,  mysterious golden dust that seems to melt into the skin, and a tablet  with the idol group Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph taunting  whoever views the tablet.  Conferring with the con's organizer, Rictavio  Bittercorn, they are charged with escorting the Hippogryphs out of the  convention.  The only problem...no one knows where they are currently  holed up, due to their idol status they keep a very low profile prior to  performances and layers of secrecy to keep their privacy.  Fortunately  Mr. Bittercorn knows a superfan and convinces her to help the Kittens  find the Hippogryphs.  Roxanne Dang is quite possibly the BIGGEST fan of  the Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph in all of Jishoap, having  intimate knowledge of each of the three remaining members (Eun-hyung,  Mozart, and Bam), their various songs and routines; along with theories  about the future career of the recently departed Hippogryph who is  starting a solo project.  She also reveals that the group has said there  will be a huge announcement at today's performance.!&lt;

&gt;!Running through some ideas and leads the group decides the first  task should be righting the wrong that Joyful has suffered which means  heading to the crowded con floor.  They start by visiting Sinclair's  friend, Professor Jubilheim, at Booth 24, and asking her to investigate  the tablet.  While it appears to have been tampered with to show the  taunting message it does little to alleviate the group's suspicions  towards the Hippogryphs.  Bringing the abjurationist back to the room  filled with scraps of fabric Jubilheim is able to repair the costumes  and the Kitten's receive 500 gold each as a token of gratitude from the  artists.  Not wanting to risk further foul play to ruin Joyful's day  Skirmish and Claudio get the attention of wrestling super star Hulk  Harlan and after a meet and greet with the legend hire him to stand  guard in front of Joyful's studio until the show begins.  Bringing the  tested fighter, and dozens of fans, between any would be costume killers  and Joyful's work.  Through all of this Roxanne is insufferably  antagonistic towards the Kittens, going to great length's to point out  how the adventuring guild is not nearly as great as the stories would  have many believe, and the the Hippogryphs are talent incarnate.!&lt;

&gt;!With Joyful's assets now safe the trio decide to try a lead of  Roxanne's, a hot dog vendor going by the name of Matt Stone.  While he  is none to happy to be approached by her again as the man seems to have  knowledge of the Hippogryph's whereabouts, he eventually gives up the  information when Skirmish raises the demand to new heights.  The idol  group is using Locker Room 4A under the alias of Deep Ooze.  While  Roxanne is over the moon to finally meet her favorite performers in the  entire world, Skirmish, Claudio, and Sinclair are eager to get the group  out of the con, receive a reward, and try their hand at winning 20,000  gold themselves.  After failing to impersonate security Skirmish forces  the door open and everyone meets the Four Kings of the Prancing  Hippogryph.  Much to everyone's surprise the idols are not only  accomplished performers but incredibly dangerous combatants!  Realizing  that the aggression is due to the Hippogryphs thinking that they were  rabid fans and the group wanting their privacy Sinclair deescalates the  situation by banishing Skirmish to a pocket plane of existence.  With  everyone cooling down after a moment the idols decide to resolve this  dispute with a dance battle.  The three Firebreathing Kittens versus  their super fan Roxanne.  Gyrations are thrown, knives are juggled,  splits are attempted, but in the end the battle is decided by Sinclair's  interpretive dance involving their newfound ability to merge with  Malachai.  Impressed by everyone's talent the Hippogryphs decide to hear  out the adventurers.!&lt;

&gt;!After some back and forth and new information coming forward  about how widespread the Ekenblim Dust is, the Firebreathing Kittens  convince the idol group that it would be in their best interest to go to  Mishui and meet with Barry the Artificer, and conveniently getting OUT  of the convention in the process.  By this point Sinclair, Skirmish, and  Slaudio have grown to have a respect for the idols and are more  understanding as to why Roxanne is such a huge fan of the group.   After sending Matti off to let Mr. Bittercorn know that the Hippogryphs  are leaving the convention they sneak the group out of the building.   Unfortunately everyone is barely two steps outside before an elvish  looking Ekenblim dashes in, grabs the performers, and whisks them  through a magic circle while taking the dust!  Putting two and two  together the Firebreathing Kittens calm a grieving Roxanne, head  straight to the con managers office, and have Skirmish bash down the  door.  Before them is Mr. Bittercorn talking with the Ekenblim from  earlier, both surprised to see a missing door.  The Ekenblim flees  through the magic circle in the office and before the con manager can  react the Kittens and Roxanne follow!!&lt;

&gt;!On the other side the find themselves in a beautiful office with a  pair of the other worldly creatures celebrating a job well done, and  the three Hippogryphs frozen by a spell.  In the ensuing fight Bam is  freed and slays both Ekenblim in a surprisingly brutal fashion and is  shaken.  Bloodied but alive, everyone is teleported back to Locker Room  4A.  Rushing back to the office to confront Rictavio they find the  office empty, except for various valuable that the adventurers decide to  liberate from the villains place of business.  Hearing that the talent  show has started the Hippogryphs and Kittens rush to the stage and make  an announcement that Mr. Bittercorn is wanted for questioning,  unfortunately the businessman made himself scarce before the show  started.  The day culminates in Roxanne, The Firebreathing Kittens, and  The Four Kings of the Prancing Hippogryph giving a dazzling performance  in front of the enthralled con goers.  The grand prize is awarded to  them and the Hippogryphs announce that their newest member is none other  than Roxanne, who is left almost speechless with excitement.!&lt;

Companion episode:  Eight Is Not Enough.    
I ran the same plot with a different party (our D&amp;D group is large enough so some people play one week and other people play another week) and they went through the story in an entirely different way.  It was a really neat experiment in storytelling; the two parties had entirely different outcomes.  Eight Is Not Enough airs next week (Wednesday May 18th, 2022), so if you'd like to hear their hilarious hijinks, tune in then.  We (Firebreathing Kittens) are a free show on all the podcast players (itunes, spotify, etc) and youtube. I wrote a Dungeons and Dragons game based on the Star Trek The Next Generation episode ""Ensign Ro"". Would they make the same logical deductions and correct conclusions like Captain Picard? Nope! Not even close! We recorded it if you want to hear how it went down."
startrek,"Maybe this is also the case on current military/naval style vessels, but I feel like so many times, someone like Erzi or Trois or whoever will have some kind of counseling session with someone, and then report to the captain about how it went. Is this ethical? To mention certain things they talked about with other officers? Or is this common practice, even now?

The example I’m thinking of is Erzi talking to Nog in season 7 of DS9, where he’s having a hard time returning to normal life, and she kind of briefs Sisko on how things are going with him and what they talked about. Doctor/patient confidentiality in the future?"
startrek,"Our first visitors through the wormhole! Does the Federation send a giant envoy for first contact with the Gamma Quadrant? Nope. It's Chief O'Brien. We meet ""I am Groot"" Tosk, check out some some Emmy-winning design and enjoy a Star Trek take on ""The Most Dangerous Game"" meets ""Running Man.""

startrek,"Evidently I can’t post an imgur link here. Let me see what I can do. Anyone have a theory about the evolutionary relevance of the curved cartilage/skin around each nostril of the cardassians? I know they probably weren’t created with anatomical species development in mind, but I’m interested to see what people have come up with."
startrek,"Now I'm going to start by saying Star Trek has always been clunky when it comes to talking about disabled issues. It's never been one of the franchises strong points but I can't help but feel we're going backwards on this. Modern Star Trek has two moments that are burned into my memory as awful representation.   


First the entire end for Pike in season two of Discovery. The writers quite literally made the concept of being wheelchair bound into a straight horror trope. The primal scream was the most anti Star Trek moment I as a disabled Star Trek fan ever saw.  


Second was on SNW where Pike tells Spock he 'knows exactly where and how he'll die'. Dude you aren't dying you're just gonna end up in a wheelchair. Shit happens. Instead of taking a moment and talking about life as a disabled person the writers basically said ""Dead? Disabled? What's the difference? I can't be the only one to have problems with this right? Newer Star Trek and disability"
startrek,"In 32c. Captain Kathryn Janeway got her own class of ships,Captain James Tiberius Kirk got his class of ship,Nog(DS9) got ship named after him...What about youngest Captain in fleet,most popular admiral that saved federation from borg,even been asimilated.Admiral,Jean Luc Picard. 32c"
startrek,"That episode, more than any other shows the depth of the father and son relationship. And it is beautiful. if you can watch ds9 ep: ""the visitor"" and not tear up...I don't wanna know you."
startrek,"Not to disparage Guinan, I loved the character, and Whoopi Goldberg’s performances, but from a technical standpoint, why was she there?

All crew quarters had food replicators (which could also produce drinks), so 10 Forward was obviously only needed as a venue for socialisation and relaxation, but with the technology available, why not just build a food replicator into every table, and several into the bar?

You (and your crew mates) could then simply sit down and state your desired food or drink, and watch it instantly materialise in front of you.

Given the availability of that technology, why have a barkeep or waiters? Why did 10 Forward need a barkeep?"

startrek,"When Burnham said ""[Let's Fly](https://youtu.be/Dbwu524cUtE?t=38)"", for some reason it made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it (perhaps it was the emotional music combined with all the crew smiling ... I dunno). I kept saying to myself, I could definitely come up with something better ... but then ... I just couldn't! I then realized how hard it is to come up with a ""good"" catch phrase.

I think ""Hit It"" is just too informal for a captain to be saying and hearing Pike say that also made me laugh (although I feel like it makes sense in the SNW's humorous context and could also make sense as Starfleet protocols may not have been as formal and developed in the early days as compared to Picard's era).

If I were the captain of a star ship perhaps my catch phrase would be ... ""Onward!"" ... I dunno LOL 

Some of the catch phrases that have been said include ([source](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/ranking-star-trek-captain-catchphrases/)):

1. “Execute” 
2. “Get It Done” 
3. “Take Us Out” 
4. “Just Do IT!” 
5. “Go!” 
6. “Punch It” 
7. “Warp me!” and “It’s Warp Time!” 
8. “Hit It” 
9. “Do It” 
10. “Let’s Fly!” 
11. “Make It So” 
12. “Engage!”

I'd love to read what everyone else's catchphrase would be. Of course it can be funny too, but I'd really like to see if there is a saying that can beat ""Engage"" and ""Make It So"" both in terms of formality and awesomeness. If you were the captain of a star ship what would your catch phrase be?"

It’s TOS cannon that a single Kirk phaser could have laid waste to that whole vineyard  and everyone in it by waiving it back and forth across the field of fire.  Was the Supervisor’s gun that much less powerful?  And for that matter, why were those 21st century weapons so ineffective in their own right?   Did assimilation make the soldiers worse shots than they would have been before assimilation?  They had laser sighting, were putting the dots on peoples heads and not firing.  And could it have been any more drawn out with the Picard flashbacks and Soong and Agnes/Queen “bwa ha ha ha” monologuing?

startrek,"I’m not a Star Trek newbie. I’ve seen TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise in their entirety. Picard gets a lot of criticism. But I’m truly grateful for this show. 

At first, I was concerned about Patrick Stewart’s age, and yes he is ancient (in a good way), but the show works with it well, and a brilliant actor is still brilliant at any age. Picard’s age actually made the show interesting and different. 

I looked forward to watching this show every week. The storylines are compelling and intelligent. The characters are likable, flawed, and well acted. And they form a nice family, an ensemble cast. Jeri Ryan as Seven, and Santiago Cabrera as Rios were great, but the entire cast is strong. For me, this show brought something new and worthwhile to the Star Trek universe.  Yes, it’s an edgy modern style, but it’s effective, and I like how they work with previous Star Trek themes, storylines, and characters. 

I’ve seen some of the negative reviews on YouTube. But for a knowledgeable and nuanced review, I found the Irish bloke at TrekCulture is one gets it. He is a true Trek enthusiast and he catches everything. 

Anyway, I guess Star Trek: Picard isn’t for everyone, but for some (maybe dozens) of us, it’s wonderful, and a worthy addition to the Trek universe. Thanks. I really enjoyed Star Trek: Picard, season 1, and season 2. There are dozens of us. Dozens!"

startrek,"Did we see/hear about Beautiful Flower's twin in season 1 of Picard?  Do we even know his name?  If not, why?

I found this thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/fox4aa/who\_is\_beautiful\_flowers\_twin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/fox4aa/who_is_beautiful_flowers_twin/)), but it seems like it was speculative/written before Picard's season one finale.  Memory Alpha doesn't have a page for the twin.

We saw how Jana's death affected her twin, Sutra, so (potentially) not even a mention of BF's twin seems odd.  Did he preach forgiveness or isolation while Sutra favored eventual violence/revenge?  Did he commit suicide?  How was he treated on the synth planet when everyone else (aside from Sutra) had a twin?  Whatever he did, it presumably would have had some effect on the other synths, right?  He didn't have to me a major character (e.g. teaming up with or opposing Sutra for an entire episode before dying) to at least be mentioned.  Given the emphasis on twins, his (apparent) absence still seems like a plot hole that should have been addressed.

Also, why did Jana travel with Beautiful Flower instead of with Sutra?

Thank you. Did we see Beautiful Flower's Twin?"
startrek,"TLDR: \~3000AD Klingons from eras past are brought forward and have to integrate in a high tech egalitarian futuristic Klingon society.

Longer:

Klingons have many cultural touch stones, but you can see some of their history as modeling the Scandinavian Viking culture of raiding and exploring, and then integrating into other cultures, and possibly in the far future becoming like modern Scandinavia with a multicultural egalitarian society.

Modeling off of the series structure in the TV series Beforeigners where people from older eras are brought to the present you could do a similar series structure for a Klingon series.

A Klingon series taking place far in the future \~3000AD which is before The Burn 

A Temporal War attack on the time crystals Klingons have access to causes thousands, maybe millions of Klingons from many eras of time to be pulled forward hundreds or thousands of years to the 'present'.  Their modern society would have to learn to integrate with their culture.

Worf or his son Alexander could be the POV character a Klingon out of time.  He would be famous and infamous for some of the things he has done or thought to have done, and how that is thought of in the future.

You can get ancient Klingons from Kahless' time and ones from the time of TOS and the first war with the Federation.  Of course you get Klingons from the time of TNG and the it can be decided how to treat the periods between TNG/DS9/VOY and 3000AD. They have 600 years to play with.  

Create an age of far galactic exploration, and an age of enlightenment which leads to our far more outwardly seeming decile future Klingons, but who have learned many new skills over the centuries making them 'peaceful' but potentially much more dangerous.

startrek,"**Big ol spoiler warning from the Picard S2 finale**

&gt;!When Wil talks about being a part of some Traveler/Watcher organization and how the universe is a risk of unraveling and its their job to ensure that its all protected and yadda yadda... I couldn't help but feel a bit discouraged by the notion that the universe is following some grand moral arc being curated by a group or individuals. It feels a bit antithetical for the series because I've generally observed that one of the most crucial underlying messages of the series is that the universe really is this vast unknowable, chaotic place, and people come together to make sense of it against the odds.!&lt;

Did that feel weird and bad to anyone else? I get that we have uber powerful beings who are essentially gods, like Q. But I took a lot of comfort in the idea that the universe wasn't headed in a specific direction that needs constant managing. It kind of sours the essence of the ""boldly go"" sentiment- if boldly going is just being on rails held delicately together by whatever these powerful forces are.

startrek,"I'd like to see the Star Trek writers dial back on the device where a captain says a few worlds before some planetary governing body and the group completely changes course.

\&gt;!Episode 1 ""Strange New Worlds"" Captain Pike convinces the two factions on Kiley 279 not to use the Warp Bomb

Season 4 ep 2 ""Discovery""  Michael says a few words that convinces NiVar to rejoin the Federation.&lt;! The course of a planet changed in with a few words from Starfleet"
startrek,"Or why didn't all the deaths in 2024 screw up the timeline? 

Forgive me if this gets a bit out there. I'm making suggestions, not declaring that I know the writers' intent. 

There have been lots of complaints made about going from worrying about butterflies to leaving a pile of dead 21st century humans and no one worried what Rios staying behind might do to the timeline. 

The answer is in the bullet holes in Chateau Picard. Picard remembered them from when his ancestors resettled, and is reassured this means ""they are on the right path."" For the bullet holes to be there, in the exact location, all of the events in 2024 had to have transpired exactly as they did, including the deaths.   


So that covers everything that happened up to that point not altering the timeline. What about Rios?   


I think it was part an acceptance that is everything thus far had been part of the ""right path"" then Rios staying may well have been as well. After all, until Q offered to send them back, they thought they all were going to live out the rest of their lives in the 21st century, and this must have been part of how it played out. 

But there is a choice. Rios could have gone back, but he didn't, and no one tried to compel him because of potential damage he might do to the timeline.   


This is, I think, Picard's real final gift to Q - an act of faith. Picard, at long last, truly believes that Q is doing right by humanity and it will all be OK. There's no more questioning his motivations, or his apparent lack of value for sentient life. When Picard questions Q on why Tallin had to die and he says ""She always dies, but this is the only timeline where she meets Renee"" it all comes together. Not only does Q care, but he knows them, he knows them all. He knows their lives, their desires, their potential futures. He exists with the burden of knowing that sometimes the Edith Keelers have to die so that much more horrible futures don't come to pass. He knows that a meaningful life is more than just how much time passes on a clock between birth and death.   


Picard finally trusts Q, understands him, knows that he is not unknowable.   


Beyond Rios and the deaths, the implications of the predestination paradox are far reaching. Q didn't just have his hand on the scale in All Good Things. The entire Star Trek timeline is the result of Q having his hand on the scale all along. Everything we've ever seen, perhaps even the creation of the Federation itself, was Q guiding humanity towards it's best possible self.

In true Q fashion, this benefits him directly. It is this timeline's Janeway who acts as arbiter in allowing Quinn to choose to end his existence. It is Janeway who intervenes in the resulting Q civil war, and ultimately the reason there's a Q Jr. out there, somewhere.   


Putting humanity on course to become its best self resolved the ultimate existential crisis of the Q, and having completed the loop, Q is able to move on past this existence. Picard S2 - Butterflies vs Predestination"

Thanks! What's the best resource for a DS9/VOY-era uniform jacket?"
startrek,"As a prelude, there will be no spoilers for current seasons of Trek in this post. I will comment on the general structure of Season 2 of Picard and Season 4 of Discovery, but will not talk about any story or plot elements.

I have what might be an unpopular opinion. Star Trek should be serialized. Deep Space 9's 5th and 6th seasons are, in my opinion, the best television the Star Trek Franchise has ever put to screen. This being said, serialization requires good implementation, and I feel that Star Trek is struggling at structuring and implementing the stories they want to tell.

Good television structure generally gives a clear structure to every episode. Each should contain a well defined setup, conflict, and resolution, while still contributing to the overall story. Deep Space 9 does this very well. Every episode, with the exception of 2 parters, has it's own story to tell. The biggest weakness of Deep Space 9 is it's filler. Despite it's strengths as an individual episode, ""Far Beyond The Stars"" contributes nothing to the overall plot (at least until it was retroactively written in the the Emissary plot in Season 7). I'm not saying that ""Far Beyond The Stars"" should not have been made, but rather it could have been stitched into Season 6 better than it is. It is still a fabulous episode.

Now that that is made clear, lets talk season long plotlines. I actually feel the best season long plot Star Trek has produced is Enterprise's Xindi arc. Other than a few occasions, each and every episode advances the plot while being self contained. I do feel that there are flaws, the season's pacing is hit or miss and still has a bit more filler that isn't integrated well. Overall though, it's a good season of television.

Now to talk a little bit about modern Trek.

Disco Season 4 starts out really strong. We are introduced to the season plot in the first episode. We get a little filler in the first half of the season, but otherwise, the episodes are well written, self contained, and still advance the season's story. This falls apart later in the season, and by the end of the season, plot points that should take minutes are stretched out to 50 minute episodes. Herein lies the biggest issue with serialized Trek.

Outside of a few situations (2 part episodes) every episode should tell it's own story. Discovery fails at this. It's not the fault of the story the writers wanted to tell. It's a structural problem. IMO, Discovery's 4th season tells a good story. It just should have been several episodes shorter. 

And Picard. IMO, Picard Season 2 felt like a 2 part episode or movie that had been stretched beyond belief. The first episode could have stood on it's own, followed by your standard TNG 2 part structure, and the same story could have been told. In all, I believe that Picard Season 2 told a story that could have been told in less than 3 hours of television while still hitting every plot point.

When 3 episodes worth of content are spread out over 10 episodes, pacing becomes a major issue. In addition, plot holes become way bigger issues that they should be. When a plot hole isn't addressed in a 2 parter, it's generally a ""Huh, that's weird?"" moment. When a plot hole isn't addressed, and instead reinforced over a span of 10 episodes, it becomes a glaring issue.

In all, I think both the most recent seasons of Picard and Discovery had stories to tell that were 100% worth telling. They were just executed badly. In Discovery's case, it leads to awkward pacing, and entire episodes that feel like they should have lasted 10 minutes. In Picard's case, it leads to a plot that spins its wheels for 7 episodes in a row.

In conclusion, Star Trek should be serialized (in some cases, I'm totally okay with Strange New Worlds being episodic), but in serializing a show, it cannot forget to tell meaningful stories in every episode. The end of an episode should feel like our hero's have done something. Some meaningful task, something worthy of our time, was completed, or failed. The fact that this isn't happening in recent Trek seasons has been a severe detriment to the overall quality of the shows.

TLDR: Star Trek's serialized seasons have failed at structuring individual episodes, and this has caused entire seasons to suffer from bad pacing, story issues, and less than satisfying solutions. (No Spoilers) Serialized Star Trek's biggest weakness."
startrek,"Wow what a mess that was, and I'm now saddened that there's even a season 3. 


YOUNG PICARD: And can we talk about Picard as a child? I've never seen such a shining example of a kids role written by someone who doesn't have kids. That boy was 10yo, completely obedient, never said more than two words, and was very clearly emotionally stunted.... I got severe aspergers vibes from the kid, possibly autism. And this kid is the same that joins the academy, gets stabbed by a naussican, and becomes the captain of the federation flagship? Do they not do psych evals? 
Nothing against the actor, he's just reading lines. But to me the kid we saw is not the man we know.


RIOS: How did they manage to completely drop the ball with the only character that deserved a spinoff? It's a crime that we now won't get Captain Rios on the Stargazer. Truly one if the best actors in this show. They should have brought his gf and her son to the 24th century. Though I'll take Captain Hansen as a second option I guess.


BORG: I guess we are falling into the further neutralization of the galaxy's biggest threat. So the borg are now a voluntary force, that is ""guarding"" some ""galactic event"" that is no bigger than a small fleet of ships. Ok. What a waste of narrative potential. We could have had a season long borg battle, but instead we get queen jurati. 

Q AND RENEE: So there was a europa mission? That brought some new alien algae to earth as a super invasive species that cleaned the oceans and skies? And Q tried to stop it cause he's dying?
Ok?!

I was defending the LA 2024 storyline for a bit, helps them save money on production to give us something awesome at the end.... but all we got was some lackluster shield wall against some transwarp conduit. Like.... what? Next time show Species8472 just pour out of that thing, blast Andoria and Qu'nos to bits and give us viewers something to look forward to for season 3.

startrek,"When season 2 starts it’s answering a call to the middle of nowhere that turns out to be the Borg. After a misunderstanding with the Borg they get popped in to the Confederation (Timeline? Universe?) by Q who after a chat and a slap with Picard, he says this is humanity’s fault. After bluffing their way through their mirror selves lives, they reconvene then go back in time with the Borg queen to go back to their future.

As they stumble around the 21st century Q pops in and out and keeps the story interesting. During one of these visits it is established he is dying of old age, which is unexpected for a near omnipotent entity. After the team finish patching up the timeline, Q confirms his destiny with Picard and resides himself to his fate. Q hugs his mortal bestie then sends everyone back to the future.

When the team wakes up in the right spot, they realise the Borg Queen is their 400 year old friend Agnes and her collective of Borg volunteers. She tells them the galaxy is gonna explode or something and she needs their ships to make a shield umbrella. They work together, save the day and make the Borg protectors of the galaxy.

So why was Q involved?

We know that the continuum the Q reside in has affects on our universe in one form or another. This was seen in Voyager during the Q Cold War where their weapons used on each other were causing Supernova’s (Supernovi?) in our universe.

It is also mentioned that Q can be killed, as indicated in the same episode from Voyager as well as Picard. Other Q have been killed too however they had taken on the forms of other life forms. For example,the ones from TNG that had a baby as humans, died as humans, but had Q powers pass on to their child. Another was the Q found by Janeway in Voyager wanting to die but was denied it by the continuum, so he got turned into a human and committed suicide.

Q said he didn’t know what was coming, and whilst it was nice to see him reconnect with Jean Luc, he knew events with the Q have caused problems on our plane of existence. With something he couldn’t anticipate nearing, and the potential repercussions of his passing, he concocted a plan to have the Borg and Starfleet form an alliance to withstand any potential threat or disaster.

As for the galaxy wide explosion, I think it was Q. That is to say Q’s passing had an affect on our universe and this was it. A Q dying of old age is unheard of and not known, so an explosion of this magnitude was intense.

TL;DR: Q’s dies and blows up the galaxy. Picard saves the day. *Spoilers* Theory about Q’s involvement in Picard season 2 *Spoilers*"
startrek,"What was the point/purpose of FBI Agent Wells section of Picard Season 2?  It might have been cliche to have him show up in the finale to help in some way (helping with security, giving Renee a pep talk, etc.), but at least it would have helped me feel he was somewhat meaningful.  As it is, it seemed kind of wasted.

Picard learned Q was dying, but only indirectly and not from Wells.  Shouldn't there have been some easier way for Q to get in touch with them rather than being in a FBI interrogation room?

How does Picard change from hearing/helping Wells understand what happened with the failed mind meld?  It kind of fits with Picard remembering/dealing with the memory of his mother, but that seemed more like Picard ""suppressing"" what happened whereas Wells ""couldn't"" have understood what happened.  Maybe it was just obvious that ""Picard helping Wells with his truth/past made Picard understand that he needed to address his own truth/past"", and only dummies like me wanted it spelled out more clearly.

Does Wells benefit in some way from knowing the truth?  His failed investigation to reveal Picard as an alien (he merely was a time-traveling flesh and blood android) got him fired from the FBI.  Did he develop a successful business on his own?  Did his family life improve/develop, having or reconciling with a spouse/children/other people who had felt pushed away by his alien obsession?  Did he help cure the oceans, too?

Was it meant to prevent the audience from asking why some sort of law enforcement wasn't investigating the crew for their actions (like commandeering a police car) during the season?  Potential investigators would see the ""alien crazy"" FBI agent was involved and thus just want to avoid it, so they didn't investigate Agnes for the bar window or the dead guy?  That might have made a little sense earlier in the season, but Wells appeared in episodes 7 and 8.

Finally, was there supposed to be a current world comparison (e.g. in season 1, the Romulans on the relocation planet standing for immigrants or refugees)?

Thank you. Purpose of FBI Agent Wells in Picard?"

It breaks down their tissues and organs at the cellular level and they are forced to rely on organ transplants to survive, which leaves many looking like cobbled-together corpses with mottled black and grey flesh in various stages of decay.

Horrifying yes but as a biologist I have wondered how the heck does such a disease actually work. Pathogens, the agents of disease, don't infect their hosts to kill them but to propagate themselves. Killing their hosts, or hindering them from interacting with other hosts, would not really augment this goal. That's not to say that lethal pathogens can't exist obviously, but the rate that they kill their hosts must be slower than the rate they infect new ones, which is usually possible with high population densities. But we know from Denara Pel that public gatherings are limited in many places, which would inhibit the spread of such a disease. So if that's true, how can it still be so present?

Also, pathogens are more easily spread when the host does not appear to be ill, which is one of the reasons Ebola didn't become a global pandemic: the hosts display serious symptoms right as they are at their greatest pathogen load, and thus their maximum capacity to spread the pathogen. This means that people recognize they are severely ill and can more easily avoid them. And having mottled putrid flesh is usually NOT a sign of being in great health.

Lastly, how has the population failed to adapt genetically to the disease? The first ones to succumb would be those with weaker or less adaptable immune systems, leaving those more resilient to the pathogen to reproduce and pass on their advantages to the next generation. Thus there would be this arms race between the host and the pathogen, with neither truly able to overtake the other. Highly lethal and/or virulent diseases can't really sustain themselves in the long haul, as they kill off the more susceptible hosts too quickly for them to reproduce, and their mutation rate is not high enough to adapt to more resilient immune systems. A great example is the 1918 Flu Pandemic, which eventually ended when so many people died the virus could not find enough hosts to sustain itself.

After pondering over the Phage, I realized that there WAS a historical precedent for such a disease: tuberculosis. Ancient skeletons, predating metal-working, ceramics, and literacy, have been found with tell-tale signs of tuberculosis infection. Moreover, tuberculosis used to be called consumption after the way it seemed to eat the victim from within, and what does phage mean? To eat.

How has tuberculosis survived as long as it has despite our best efforts to cure, treat, and even eradicate it? Tuberculosis has a number of advantages over other pathogens, which I will list down below.

1. Tuberculosis is often asymptomatic, meaning patients can carry and transmit the disease without showing symptoms, allowing them to pass it on without anyone knowing.
2. Tuberculosis can also develop differently, with some people suffering for years before dying while others go into a remission for a decade after a long period of illness only to suddenly take a turn for the worse.
3. The pathogen responsible for tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is surprisingly adaptable, and can enter a dormant stage when presented with antibiotics. And if a patient fails to complete their course of treatment, which can take weeks or months, it can return resilient to the antibiotics.

So perhaps the Phage works in a similar manner to tuberculosis. The Vidiians suffering the worst effects may simply be ""used goods"" in the eyes of the pathogen, and the majority of the population are already infected but asymptomatic. 

Now are there holes in this theory? Probably yes. But it seems like such a good fit at this point in time that I had to get it out. Phage is Alien Tuberculosis"
startrek,"Captain Archer convinced his nemesis to help bring starfleet back to life (""First Flight"") and formulated the federation altogether. Kirk brought about the Klingons peace treaty with the federation. Picard pulled in the Romulans and kept the Klingons in line. Sisko did almost everything, balancing Cardassians, Klingons, Bajorans and essentially defeted the Dominion (""all along being the Emissary""). Burnham...ended the Klingong-Federation war. 

Who was the best?

I felt it may have been a toss up between Archer and Picard. Which character was the best diplomat?"

startrek,"Discovery was good and unconventional, but season 4 was an emotional crap box that was a waste of time. The story had potential, but more time was devoted to feelings. To be frank it wasn't star trek realistic. I won't be disappointed if it is cancelled.

Picard is better and I think season 3 is set up the best for a good run.

Strange New Worlds made me feel the true star trek vibe from the shows like TNG and voyager. I truly enjoyed the first episode.

Debate? Opinion? Discovery vs Picard vs Strange New worlds."
startrek,What if Paul Wesley’s appearance as Kirk opens with him in 2266 recapping a Strange New Worlds era story to the entire TOS crew on the bridge of his Enterprise as a framing device?

startrek,"It’s a bit of a running joke that the last person you want as ship’s counselor is a Klingon, but I can think of several times in my own life when a good old “Martok pep-talk” would have been incredibly valuable.

How does a Klingon counselor address mental issues in a way that Starfleet finds productive?

What do they say to the person with suicidal ideations who feels the galaxy is better off without them?

How do they address crippling anxiety?

What do they tell the person with PTSD from unacknowledged trauma?

How do they talk about narcissism and anger issues? Advice from a Klingon counselor on a Federation starship"
startrek,"I remember an episode (maybe Deep Space Nine?) where there was a couple (I think they were both crew members) who decided they wanted to have a baby, but their species required a third gender as a catalyst to achieve a pregnancy. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Vaguely remember an episode. Hope you can help me."
startrek,"While STW looks very promising, I was less than impressed with Picard and to a lesser extent, Discovery.

If I was the show runner, I would love to create a Star Trek series that takes place a few years before TNG, when the Federation was at war with Cardassia.  The show would focus around Miles O'Brien, serving as Tactical Officer aboard the USS Rutledge.   His commanding officer is  Benjamin Maxwell and the two of them along with other crew mates from the Rutledge would be the main cast with a new Cardassia Overseer who would be the main antagonist. I would do one season just on the battle at Seklik III. The show would of course highlight O'Brien's first kill as he described in The Wounded. 

God I would love to see this arc explored! My idea for a Star Trek show"
startrek,"Recently finished Picard S2 and one aspect ticked me off in particular: The shallowness in how the show tackles real world problems. Hear me out.

Science fiction is meant to make creative analogies to point at bad things in our everyday life and make us consider. Old Star Trek did this in great detail, dedicating whole episodes towards hot topics of the time. In Picard S2 we mainly have two such themes: (US) immigration issues &amp; climate change. But how are these handled?

Rios is detained by comic-like evil ICE agents which besides their evilness have no other defining character traits to them. The plot line ends with our heroes defeating the guards of one ICE truck, freeing all passengers. That's it. No deeper exploration of how xenophobia built these structures, no discussion about how xenophobia might be irrational but a very human thing.

Climate change and its threat to modern civilization is mentioned multiple times throughout the season, but ultimately told to be solved using &gt;!a miracle microbe found by the Europa mission!&lt;. Really? What is this telling the viewers? “You don't have to change your behaviour, use less resources, or be more mindful with the planet you have, because eventually some new miracle tech might fix everything.”

That makes me just mad. Is Star Trek still science fiction or pure space fantasy by now? Is this still science fiction?"
startrek,I used to think that the existence of trek would lead to us avoiding the post atomic horror (in trek this is a historical period that takes place in between now and trek) I see now that the way things fall apart is that JJ Abrams turns Trek into another action franchise for kids. Dark days ahead?
startrek,"I actually enjoyed season 1 despite its flaws, and I thought it gave Data a decent conclusion as opposed to his arbitrary death in Nemesis. Meanwhile I could barely get through season 2; it was all over the place and had no coherent plot. ""Saving the future"" basically amounted to Picard giving Renee a brief pep talk. They attempted to give a final send-off to Q, but I think it wasn't done as well as Data's send-off in season 1. Which season of Picard was better?"
startrek,"In Far Beyond the Stars we get the implication that all of Star Trek (or at least DS9) is in the mind of a 1950s fiction writer.

Assuming that is true and at some point after his incarceration his work is finally published in the 1960s then it stands to reason it would be hugely popular and quickly garner a massive fan base... Afterall, we're told how incredible Bennys work is during the episode.

Doesn't it stand to reason that having read the few DS9 stories by Benny that other young writers (possibly boys looking like Jeffery Hunt and William Shatner) might be inspired to co-write their own stories. These stories do well and eventually by the 1970s young Jimmy writes a couple of novels about the adventures of the enterprise.

In France a French boy is scribbling stories inspires by Jimmy's stories and then back in America, a boy in New Orleans (also called Benny) tries to continue the Benny Russell stories while a girl is transporting her story to the other side of the galaxy. A little later, a well loved actor decides to set stories before the Jimmy Shanahassy stories.

Things go quiet for a few years until a group of fans decide to work together with their own stories. A girl is inspired writes redemptive stories from the perspective of a federation prisoner, they all work together on a series of funny short stories that just make them roll on the floor laughing.

The little girl (Kate, now a grown woman with children) who wrote the stories across the other side of the galaxy decides to write some fun adventures inspired by her children. And the French boy uses his life experiences to tell how the further adventures of captain of the original spin-off. Finally, Chris Jr finds his dad's original stories and decides to write stories of his own.

...

It's a nice story. But what's even better, it answers every continuity error between series. The stories written in the 1960s and those written today were all put together by people who were inspired to tell their stories. And best of all, since Far Beyond the Stars is canon... Then this theory holds up. every plot hole in Star Trek can be explained away as Benny Russell fanfic."
startrek,"Something bothered me about the ""This Season on Strange New Worlds"" promo that came out after last week's episode. In it, you hear La'an Noonien-Singh say ""La'an to bridge"". But wait a minute - Isn't La'an her given name? Usually, characters use their surname over communications. It's ""Pike to bridge"", not ""Chris to bridge"". Then I remembered that Khan Noonien-Singh, her apparent relative, was always addressed in communications as ""Khan"", which is his given name. Why isn't the surname used like in most other cases? Help me understand how names are used"
startrek,"That's how long team Picard was in the past for. 4 days. And in that time Rios is able to meet and fall in love with someone so much that he stays in the past and risks the future on. 4 days.

And everyone is like ""yeah no problem, it's not like we've spent the last 4 days making sure history happens the correct way and we don't end up in that alternate timeline. Besides it's not like Rios is the kind of guy who will give a full confession to someone in law enforcement the first chance he gets.""

I know things like this have been done before (Voyage Home, Yesterdays Enterprise) but this one seems insane. It's just lazy writing because they had no idea what to do with Rios going forward, and if they're setting up some captain 7 of 9 story line, needed him off the Stargazer so she could be promoted there. Seems like a much easier solution would be to have him get injured just before Q returns them, and he's taken to sick bay and that's why Picard makes 7 the captain then. Afterwards he can go back to being captain of the Stargazer while 7 gets her own Ship if that's what they are planning. 

But no, just leave him a few hundred years in the past and hope it all works out, much better solution. 4 Days (Picard S2 Spoilers)"
startrek,"But I may be addicted to Star Trek. With Picard, SNW and lower decks I keep finding myself wanting to watch more star trek. I often end up watching DS9 or Voyager, and every now and then TNG. Instead of watching new shows I end up watching old star trek. Nothing else out there quite captures the hope unity and future that star trek portrays. Yes there's a lot of good scifi out there but they are all dystopian. Star trek is the only one that really shows that humanity figured its shit out and reached for the stars. I guess that's why I'm so compelled to watch star trek. What about you? I'm not an addict"

startrek,"The new Star Trek starts off wierd with a spock sex scene but i can live with that, but about in the middle of the first episode they just start cutting and cutting and leaving out important pieces of content. Pike just teleports around to different places giving speeches and inspiring confidence but there is no lead up to it, were not shown him practicing the speech or anything like that, he just does it, like a surprise attack, he could use this shit to jumpscare enemies to death.

Getting back to the start were told that the Enterprise is not yet ready to go, but there is, once again, zero follow up on that - not a single system is malfunctioning. Guess what we were told before is completely pointless now.

The ship that the Enterprise was rescuing was empty when we arrived there, where tf was the crew at, afaik Pike only rescued like 2.5 officers, are we to believe that the ship of that size can be run by just three people or did the captain just take the entire crew for an unannounced holiday to the planet ? What is this(i may have actually missed something here but its still stupid)

Were also not introduced to a single character other than the ones that we already somewhat know from other tv series and honestly the bridge crews in the late Star Trek series look like they've all been written exactly the same and they're waaaay too comfortable on the bridge, take for example the ensign communication officer, she literally smiles and handles the console like a senior and talks to the captain like if they were good friends despite just meeting him, there is no humanity in that, she just extremely confidently answers everything and does her job perfectly just like every other cloned officer on that bridge. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds rant"
startrek,"I really liked the intro of new character of La'an, and the bit of mystery about her ""file"". Her name and comment about the ""colony ship"" lead me to speculate that she is an augment, likely the daughter of one of Khan's contemporary, if not Khan himself. She references being the sole survivor of a colony ship that was captured by the Gorn. However, in ""Arena"" it appears that Kirk's encounter is first contact with the Gorn. So why would Kirk have not known about the Gorn if Starfleet already had an officer who had been a captive as a child?  

I think it might be a good indicator that her ""colony ship"" was on one of the sister ships of the Botany Bay. These ships left Earth carrying augments in stasis secretly in the 1990s, and their locations were known only to section 31. However, Section 31 did not share that information with Kirk, despite the possibility that he would encounter one of them during the Enterprise's 5 year mission. It would also explain why the Gorn were initially so hostile to humans - the first ones they met were augments who fought back and tore up their nursery instead of being the docile prey they expected. Captain Pike says he read her file, which would be highly classified if she were an augment, including the part about being captured by the Gorn. But Pike and Spock are both privy to classified information that Kirk was not cleared to have.

startrek,"Very excited about the potential of Strange New Worlds.  In particular due to Anson Mount's Chris Pike.  He was excellent in DIS, but now that he has his own show, I think it will be an exciting time.  I've been trying to wrap my head around the why I like this Pike.  Is it the actor or the character?  Not sure, as I haven't seen him in many other things to form a baseline.  But I will say that I've finally found the word that I associate with Pike.  ""Gravitas.""  There is a great charisma and dignity to how this character comes across.  That doesn't mean he is serious all the time or isn't fun to be around, but rather has a presence that you feel and want to be around.  I have experienced this in real life less than a handful of times but it is associated with a person you would follow without question.  To be sure, there are great Captains in Star Trek.  And I'm not going to say one is better than another.  But there are certainly differences and levels of ""confidence"" or trust, I would personally follow.  If I may perhaps use a mediocre example:   If these captains said the following, here would be my response.  


""The sun rises in the west""  (on Earth, joker).

Me to Archer.  ""Uh, No ding-dong. Check your sensors""

Me to Kirk. ""Funny.   Good joke.  You want a refill?""

That's *a lot* of TV. Not to mention the **13** movies, soon to be **at least 11 more seasons** of TV since the reboot, **over a dozen** video games, and countless books.

startrek,"My wife and I are on the 8 billionth Trek watch through, and something that's definitely noticeable is the social commentary.  It was good enough in the TOS that MLK was a fan.  

In TNG most of the memorable episodes were about the definition of human, which wasn't social commentary, but still an interesting moral and ethical exploration.  Still, it has the Ferengi in the first season, and they're a clear commentary on the materialism of the 80s.  Klingon's are changed to mirror the complicated US/Russia relationship in the 90s.  The terrorism episode (High Ground) had trouble getting broadcasted in Ireland.  (And it starts the Bajor / Cardassia thing which definitely resonates with Northern Ireland).  It tries and fails to address Native Rights (that one sucks).  

DS9 is the high point of social commentary.  There's a noticeable motif of grappling with Imperialism, even the [cheerful cultural Imperialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ) of the Federation.  There's a wonderful implicit comparison between the Federation's beneficent Imperialism, the naked desire for control of the Dominion, and the purely extractive and evil Imperialism of the Cardassians.  The entire series has characters grappling with alien beliefs that challenge their own.  Even the Prime Directive episodes in TNG and DS9 are really reflections on Colonialism.  

Beyond Colonialism DS9 has an enormous theme of the relationship of religion and politics (which it does well until the last season).  Then there's more Bell Riots, euthanasia (disease episode), gay rights / gender identity (Reunion), Unionization (Bar Association), Immigration (Sanctuary), eminent domain (Progress), etc.  These are deeply personal stories too.  Keiko embodies the conflict working women face; she gives up her job for her family and takes a traditionally female job as a teacher, but it makes her unhappy.

Voyager steps back from this.  It can't exactly engage in much Imperialism being disconnected from the Federation.  It does WMDs/nuclear weapons at least four times; Silicon Valley (Future's End);  Date Rape (Blood Fever); and pollution (the Malon).  Almost all of these are a bit tame in comparison to DS9.  Saying nuclear weapons are bad after the Cold War isn't exactly timely.  Blood Fever more shows a change in norms rather than addressing the issue.  The Malon were Captain Planet villains; few actual humans are pro-pollution.  The only bit of social commentary (I remember) that was pretty cutting was Critical Care, which is deeply critical of our for-profit medical system.

Enterprise's social commentary was... pathetic.  Their treatment of gender is regressive.  Fusion, is the first episode of any show ever to show that rape is bad.  Two Days, where horny men are punished by gender changing thieves.  Cogenitor, where an inappropriately gendered relationship ends in tragedy.  (Also, all the weird ass goo rubbing scenes.)  The AIDS episode (Stigma) was cowardly; the stigma about AIDS wasn't exactly common by 2000.  Then there's a Sept. 11 attack, and the best way to deal with it is by Archer compromising his principles.  

Picard... well, it tried.  But not too hard.

Is Discovery better in this regard? Does Discovery do any good social commentary?"

They should have said why the Borg fail, which we've already seen some evidence of.

""You can't assimilate or adapt to what you don't understand. In every timeline, you eventually come across a race like Species 8472 that you can't conquer - and it inevitably leads to your downfall.""

Why they didn't do that, I don't understand. The entire ""You're lonely"" part could have been left out. Or if they wanted to keep it, supplement the above with ""Perfection will always elude you until you find a way to overcome your own hurdles - by working alongside what you don't understand.""

startrek,"Now I know this is request would take some dev time and isn't exactly a small ask, and has been discussed before, but as someone who loves the Ferengi Alliance, their lore/culture and their ships, I think it'd be super fun to have Ferengi's as their own playable race lik Romulans.  

Now yes I know you can play as Ferengi feds, but I mean it'd be neat if the Ferengi Alliance were their own playable race, with their own tutorial and series of ships just like the Romulans. And also like the Romulans, you eventually choose for your Ferengi Alliance character to join KDF or FED like Romulans do.  

I think it'd be a lot of fun! A whole set of new Ferengi-themed ships, tutorial missions, amongst other things. Kind of like what they did for the Klingons in Year of the Klingon, only this time, it's a whole new playable Ferengi Alliance character! Year of the Ferengi"

startrek,"I just watched the first episode of ST:SNW. I noticed an easter egg. Can you confirm it?

&gt;!I noticed the buzzing sound from the TOS episode ""Wink of an Eye"" when Nurse Chapel was talking about the ""few alternations"" that are needed to blend in. !&lt; Star Trek: Strange New Worlds - New Easter Egg? Spoiler!"
startrek,"Like a lot of this sub, the first two episodes of Picard S2 had me extremely excited. A cool new setting and faction with the Confederation (which almost immediately manages to be more intereseting than the Terran Empire), references to Sisko, Dukat, and Martok to please DS9 fans like me, Rios as captain of the Stargazer and Picard acting like classic Picard. 

The rest of the season has just felt like watching a slow-motion trainwreck, though. I kept hoping that the time travel plot would be resolved in a few episodes so we could get back to the interesting stuff, i.e. the Confederation and the 2401 timeline, but god if they didn't find every possible way to drag this out. The back and forth seduction/corruption dynamic between Jurati and the Borg Queen got old pretty quickly for me, as did Seven and Raffi's 'will they-won't they' relationship and Rios' very obviously telegraphed infatuation with the nurse. You are a Starfleet captain, man, you don't get a pass for egregiously violating the temporal prime directive because you've got a crush on a woman you've known for two days. And aside from some tiny easter eggs, it feels like the show has been actively avoiding focusing on the more unique-to-Trek elements of a 2024 setting, like the Sanctuary Districts and the fact that the Eugenics Wars are a thing that happened.

There are a few interesting things thrown into the mix, like Q's mysterious condition, Guinan, and the one FBI agent who met some Vulcans as a kid, but there's just so much pointless melodrama and bad writing to slog through to get to the good stuff. The Picard childhood trauma plot feels way too drawn out- it could've easily been wrapped up in one episode, but the same could be said for a lot of plot points this season. I'm currently about a third of the way through episode nine, watching Picard have another childhood flashback in the middle of a firefight, and I've just hit a wall- the show has lost me, and I have no remaining motivation to finish the season. 

I apologize for not being more positive, but it's just been crushing to be so excited by S2 at first, and then to have those hopes slowly crushed over two months. And watching the amazing SNW premier just a few days ago really highlighted my problems with Picard and this drawn out serialized story even more clearly. I've read articles where the showrunners promise that S3 will return to spaceships and the futuristic setting, but the very tone of these comments seems to indicate they knew in advance that the season-long trip to 2024 wouldn't be popular, which makes this whole thing even more bewildering to me. 

In summary, apologies for the long rant, but is it worth pushing through the end of Picard S2, or am I better off just watching SNW and waiting for S3 of Lower Decks? Picard is my favorite captain, but I can't muster the will to finish Picard S2. Is it worth pushing through?"
startrek,"I now that I'm a little late in watching Picard, but when I saw that the Balter is Jean Luc's father, that explains a lot.

Does that make Number Six Jean Luc's mother?

If so, then Picard is both a Cyborg and a Borg. Gaius Baltar is Jean Luc's Father."
startrek,"So I’m currently watching the 6th season of Voyager and I can’t help but think that PicRd and the crew of the Enterprise would’ve been able to find Voyager and get them home. 

Janeway is a great captain but it annoys me they constantly stop to explore a ton of rando planets. I get they are searching for quicker ways to get home but I don’t feel like the prime directive should 100% apply in the delta quadrant. If there’s a ship that starts to attack they should retreat. 

That would be my thought if I was on the crew. As a viewer I get that it wouldn’t make a good show if there was no drama. 

It’s like watching a horror movie and yelling at the people not to go into the dark barn full of chainsaws. Doesn’t mean I’m not going to enjoy the movie. Watching Voyager season 6"
startrek,"My son really liked SNW so I thought we could delve into TOS a little bit for some reference for him. Surprisingly I've actually never seen ""The Cage"" myself. Is it worth watching or are most of the important details re-shown during ""The Managerie""?

Also, what do you consider ""essential"" episodes for TOS? I don't think he'll get through all of them but thought of showing him the highlights. TOS questions"

startrek,"Just for fun, here is my take on the best possible ship the Federation could build (circa 2380's) using Canon technology.

Body style and size: Galaxy Class

Hull: Reinforced tritanium with nano tech, self replicating ablative armor (Voyager: Endgame)

Engines:  Transwarp drive, max speed warp 9.9997.

Shields: Self replicating primary, secondary, and tertiary forward and aft shield generators, available through main, back up, or 3rd redundant power systems (DS9 - O'Brien comments that a 3rd redundant back up is best, since the first 2 could fail).

-Further apply Barkley's shield mods from the Nth Degree for a 300% increase in shield power, set on a modulating frequency that changes every 0.1 seconds.

Weapons: 12 bank Type 8 phaser array (Sovereign class), 4 bank phaser cannon array (Defiant class), quantum torpedoes, transphasic torpedoes, gravimetric torpedoes, Type 5 long range tactical unit Antimatter torpedoes (VOY: warhead), and Chroniton torpedoes (Krennim time ship)

Other external defenses: Time phasing (Krennim ship), temporal displacement wave (Borg sphere), tractor beams, deflector array

Internal defenses:  Holographic emitters in every room, designed to deploy emergency medical holograms (Vogager) and emergency Combat Holograms (Picard) in the design of species 8472, set at maximum difficulty.

- Transwarp beaming capability.

Crew compliment:  Captain - Picard
First officer - Kira
Second officer - Data
Chief tactical officer - Odo
Chief Engineer - Miles Edward O' f-ing Brien.
Cheif of Medicine - Bashir
Chief science officer - Seven if Nine
Ship's counselor- Professor Moriarty

So we have a ship that exists outside of normal space time, which can then time travel at will, impervious to all conventional means of attack.

If somehow forced back into normal space time, Shields would be difficult for any weapon to penetrate, and even entire empires would be threatened by the type 5 antimatter or transphasic torpedoes.

Any boarding party would be ripped apart by tripedal psychic apex predators, while all starfleet personnel would be surrounded by doctors and shields.  If somehow they break through the lines, the crew could transwarp beam to anywhere in the galaxy to escape, then set a chroniton torpedo to self destruct and wipe out the threat from existence.

What did I miss?  Any ideas on a ship or attack strategy that could overcome all this?  Or just cool ideas for new ships using  available technology? The Ultimate Starship made entirely from Canon technology."
startrek,"So I am a fairly new Star Trek fan. I have seen the 3 movies with Chris Pine, along with the 3rd season of Discovery and the first episode of the new show Strange New Worlds. Just curious as to weather I should go back and watch any of the older movies and series and if so which ones. New Star Trek Fan"
startrek,"Looking for streaming service. Too bad Netflix pulled all Trek shoes off their app. Canadian trekkies, where do you watch Picard Season 2 and Strange New Worlds?"
startrek,"When I was watching SNW I relised something. If SNW would have been the first new ST show I would be actually excited. But after seeing PIC and DISC things that would have been minor nitpicks are imersion braking and as such hard to ignore. One example would be haw everyone ignores the chain of command when talking to eachother. 

Other things I wouldn't have even realized. How the plot is ""Start Trek"" to the absolute extreme. If you fed an AI with all the ST content there is and told it to write the most cliche ST plot it would propably write something similar. 

Even things I wouldn't have minded at all fill me with dread because I don't trust the writer anymore. Una Chin-Rileys backstory is somewhat reminiscent Tasha Yars backstory. After PIC and DISC I just don't want to watch Stafleet Officers with untreated trauma which clearly impeeds their decision making any more.

I'll give SNW a chance and hope it'll win me over. I realy do, but if it doesn't it will be the last live action ST show I'll watch at least until the showrunners and writing team changes. PIC and DISC made me a more cynical person"
startrek,"If Brent Spiner plays another one of Data's ancestors one more time it'll be too Soong. Star Trek, The Pundiscovered Country"
startrek,"I watched Strange New World season 1 ep 1 and thought it had a lot of potential but wish there was a little more meat to it. 

The concept is great, I love the idea of a pre-warp civilization that saw a major event happening and was able to pick up on some of the tech, and I like the idea of how it was used in a civilization that hadn't moved past conflict, but I falt we didn't get to explore more of that conflict. 

I just feel like it was very rushed, we spend so much time rehashing the same vague scene with pike that it feels like we don't we really do anything else(hyperbole of course but you get the point), I think the whole thing felt very weird pacing wise, slow in the beginning and fast at the end but I feel the ending is a great example of that. 

This could have been a great scene if we were a little more involved with civil war aspect, we're told that there is a centuries old civil war raging and  the leaders are desperate and willing to use extreme measures to end it, but that's exactly it we're only ever told that we never see it so it feels kind of hollow. 

Honestly if I were to do one thing to fix it I would spit it into 2 parts. It felt like they were trying to give us a long drawn out episode at the beginning but then ran out of episode and had to push everything at the end so I would split the episode into 2 parts to give them more time to work with, then I would spend the first one on the rescue of #1 and exploration of the civil war, motivations, how it effects the people, we see military schools at the end maybe explore that and how this war has effected the people and caused them to suffer, then at the end of the episode rescue #1 and have it take a bit longer it felt to easy in the episode, like they just kinda walked in and took her. 

For part 2 I would focus on ending the war, have Capt Pike look for ways to end the war without exposing them and then spend the episode looking at the rebel side and have Pike convince the 2 leaders to negotiate on enterprise and show them the destruction and have that move them to work for peace before sending them back to enact change and work for peace on their own. 

Idk these are just ideas and I am by no means a professional but these are just some of my thoughts how do you guys feel about it. How are we feeling about ""strange new worlds"" #1'1"
startrek,Just wondering... I figured it would be set in 2258.. Is Strange New Worlds set in 2258 or 2259?
startrek,"I know there is a lot of debate about the new Trek shows. Some love them and that's fine. Some hate them and that's okay too.

I felt nothing.

I have watched some of Discovery and found it boring - the only character I found mildly engaging was Pike which gives me hope for SNW. I have just finished watching the second season of Picard, and as I reflect back on the series I just feel empty. It's not just that the writing was bad or that the characters lacked any sort of meaningful depth, or even that the creators seem to have picked up an obsession with trying to emotionally manipulate the audience instead of just letting the story breathe. It just all seems so hollow, and I can't really explain why.

How is it that a show which is obsessed with emotions has left me feeling divorced from mine?

When I think about what I enjoy about a TV show one of the primary reasons for wanting to go back and rewatch it in the future is because I enjoy spending time with the characters. The truth is I love to watch Riker and the others play poker, or sit with Bashir in Vic's bar or even hang out in the mess hall on Voyager with the smell if Neelix's cooking. And it's not just nostalgia colouring my perception either. There have been plenty of TV series that I have watched since childhood where I an happy to put them back on and enjoy my time with the characters.

I don't feel like I know any of the characters in Picard, and I guess that's why I am very unlikely to go back and rewatch the series.

And that's sad.

It's sad because I live Star Trek and Jean-Luc Picard was a huge role model for me growing up and this new series feels like a betrayal.

And if you disagree with me that's okay - we all feel differently about TV. Apologies for the long ramble but I guess I just needed to try and figure out why this show left me feeling nothing at all. Star Trek: Picard's greatest crime? I felt absolutely nothing."
startrek,"Star Trek Strange New Worlds should introduce us to Cardarasn’s and Bajorans from the TOS Time period, before the Cardassian Occupation of Bajor.

44. Why doesn't the same said characters not simply tell FBI agent they know Soong is planing to stop the mission and has evidence because he tried to run over with his car at the same event so they can bust down his door? Oh right, no one else saw it or apparently had no cameras. I even mentioned that. I'm such an idiot.

48. Should an astronaut who is going into space be drinking hard liquor two days before going to space?
49. How is Taillin able to walk around in a high security area and not be stopped just because she has on an astronaut uniform on? I mean how would security or staff not know everyone involved in the mission by this point? (That's right see #34 again).

startrek,""" The one you call Number One has the superior mind and will produce highly intelligent offspring. Although she seems to lack emotions, this is largely a pretense."" 

Ever since I've become a Trekkie, I've been obsessed with one episode of TOS: the Cage. I mainly watched that episode over and over again for Number one. The fact that she was the proto-Spock, in terms of being the highly logical and stoic member of the crew, was fascinating to me, yet at the same time frustrating that this potentially rich character never got the chance to be explored. I wanted more of this woman with the steel trap mind who likes to play it emotionless on the bridge. I consumed a lot of beta canon just to get more of her including Vulcan's Glory.

So I was ecstatic when I learned that Discovery would finally feature Number One. Needless to say I was disappointed, she only made brief appearances and I didn't get the cerebral, capable first officer had been yearning for all these years--aside from that moment she had enough foresight to outfit the shuttles with the latest weaponry. 

I think my biggest gripe with her is that she feels like the bog standard first officer and not this uniquely interesting character that the Star Trek Bible promised. For me, I thought the question of why she seemed to lack emotion  a fascinating question. I was hoping for a Spock and Saavik mentor- protege with her and Spock given how similar they are-- We did get that somewhat in Q&amp;A. Maybe it's a matter of reality not matching expectations. Even though episode 3 is set to expand and explore her character further, I'm not particularly anticipating it. There’s nothing fascinating about her anymore to me. Is anyone else rather disappointed in Number One(Una)"
startrek,"I could barely finish it when it first came out and hated the ""new"" look&amp;feel, the song and trip.

startrek,"So it appears Isa Briones announced in her Instagram that she won’t be returning for Season 3. So I ask the question: what the hell was the entire point in the end?

The entire first season was, for the most part, dedicated to her and her story. Season 2 she became a complete afterthought. But the tease her joining Wesley and potentially being associated with that anomaly…or other potential stories.

Now she is done? What was the point of that damn scene with Wesley then?

I personally felt she was the highlight of season 1 and had so much potential wasted in season 2. Now the three best new characters introduced in series (Soji, Rios, and Jurati/Borgat) are not returning for season 3.

This again just shows that those running the ST IP have no idea what they are doing. You very easily could have had a perfect send off in season 3 including OG TNG characters and the new Picard characters…..if they knew what they were doing. Season 3 Picard Departures"

startrek,"I don't know if they still do this these days, but back in my day, a popular topic for radio stations and music-oriented publications was *Desert Island Discs*: a musician is asked to compile a list of records they would bring with them to a desert island, as if they were the only records they would ever be able to listen to again.

Let's do that for Star Trek episodes. Pick one episode for each series that you would take to a desert island. These may not be your favorite episodes, but they should be episodes you could pick up and watch at any time under any circumstances, over and over again. Two-hour episodes and two-part episodes count as one.

I'm confining myself to live action series only, just because it's easier that way; don't feel restricted by my choice. My list:

**TOS**: *The Menagerie*

This was the first episode of *Star Trek* I ever saw (I had seen TWOK in the theater a few months earlier) and I still remember how raptly I watched this story of two captains, so different yet so similar, as they dealt with some surprisingly advanced ethical questions. As SNW brings us back to the tale of Captain Christopher Pike, this is an episode all fans owe it to themselves to watch. If I live to by a hundred, *The Menagerie* will always be my jam. 

**TNG**: *The Best of Both Worlds*

This is kind of a default choice, I admit. I could so easily pick *Yesterday's Enterprise*, *The Offspring*, *Tapestry*, or *Parallels*, but nothing brings back my youth like *BoBW* and the exquisite, excruciating summer of 1990. If you weren't there, you don't know.

**DS9**: *Far Beyond the Stars*

A lot of choices here too. My choice of *Far Beyond the Stars* over such gems as *Duet* and *Trials and Tribble-ations* is due in part to my love for mid-century Americana as well as the deeply felt meaning that Avery Brooks and the rest of the cast imbued it with. I will never get tired of watching this episode.

**VOY**: *Worst Case Scenario*

This. This is the perfectly self-contained *Voyager* episode. Every action taken by everyone makes total sense based on everything that had come before, and it all added up to one of the most entertaining romps Trek has ever given us. I could watch this episode every day for months.

**ENT**: *In a Mirror, Darkly*

If scenery chewing were an Olympic event, the *Enterprise* cast would have swept all the medals for this one. I'm so happy that I get to put a Mirror Universe episode on my list, and even happier that it's this one.

**DIS**: *Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad*

Don't have much to say about this one, other than it's a Harry Mudd episode and that we get to watch Captain Lorca get killed over and over again.

**PIC**: *Nepenthe*

A big part of me wants to pick *Stardust City Rag*, just because Freecloud is so much fun. At the end of the day, though, I just can't resist watching Picard circle back around to Will Riker and Deanna Troi and their adorable kid.

**SNW**: *Strange New Worlds*

I choose this because it's the only episode we've seen! If it's any indication, though, this is the series I've been waiting for, and I can't wait for more. Desert Island Episodes"

If you could explore any ship or star base in the star trek universe with one would it be?"
startrek,"I grew up watching Star Trek with my dad, seeing TNG, DS9 and VOY on primetime BBC2, enjoying the comradeship and professionalism of the TNG crew, the action and friendships in DS9 and both of us swooning over seven in VOY. I've got two boys of my own now and had been really looking forward to sharing that enjoyment with them, but with the abundance of kids TV available to them and the success of things like Star Wars I've been left gutted as they've had no interest in watching any Star Trek with me. I've tried to show them the likes of TNG but it's a product of its time and they just had no interest in watching it with me.

That is until Prodigy started on Nickelodeon, they liked the look of the adverts so asked if we could download it. We're all sat together watching it now with the kids enjoying the cool ship, the interesting technology, the action and the mystery. I've been trying to explain to them how this show reflects some of the themes of the TNG era programmes, like the mysteries, the exploration etc. and they're finally interested in trying some of the other programmes with me. So as far as I'm concerned, Prodigy has done it's job and got my kids interested in Trek. Star Trek Prodigy seems to be doing its job"

startrek,"There was some discussion about this on this reddit a few weeks ago, but a line Guinan had in the finale made things even more complicated. When Picard meets Guinan in 2024, she has no idea who he is, even though she met him previously in the 1890's (TNG Time's Arrow). The best theories I heard that explained this said that she didn't remember this because the future where Picard went back to the 1890's didn't exist, because until they completed their mission in 2024, the Confederation Timeline was the future.  
However, in the finale Guinan stated that she remembered meeting Picard in 2024 *before* he went back in time to 2024, and just didn't mention it to avoid changing the timeline. This raises the question, how did she remember changes to the timeline before they were made? If they were always part of the timeline and Picard and crew were always destined to go back in time to assure the Europa launch, then shouldn't Guinan have remembered meeting Picard in the 1890's in 2024? Or did Guinan in Picard s2e01 not remember this, but after Picard returned her memories changed to make her think she did?

This give anyone else a headache? The Guinan Paradox (Spoilers for Picard S2 Finale)"
startrek,"Once Jurati befriended and ""tamed"" the queen, the Borg became ""friends.""

Does this mean that Picard's rejection of the queen in both BOBW and First Contact delayed peace with the Borg? Does Jurati prove that Picard and/or Data could have ""rescued"" the Borg by being the Queen's Friend (like she wanted)?"
startrek,"The kinder, gentler Borg is not a paradox, and the queen accepting Jurati's offer made sense. 

First, I've seen lots of comments saying the events of Picard season 2 should have resulted in wiping out all of the events involving confrontation with the Borg and drastically altering Federation history and making it to where none of what happened in Picard happened.   


That assumes that Borgati took control of the Borg collective we'd already encountered. I don't think she did. What makes sense is that she started a new ""Collective of the willing"" in an area of space the known Borg didn't control, and not explored by the Federation up through the 24th century.   


So the original Borg are still out there, with their own queen. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, why did the queen accept Jurati's offer? Because Jurati had won, and accepting the offer was the only way to live to fight another day. It was a stalemate between Jurati and the Queen, but Jurati keeping the queen paralyzed and unable to harm the crew meant that she was vulnerable, and there was a good chance Raffi would kill her when Seven died. Accepting the offer kept her alive. She may well have been thinking that she would be able to subdue the Jurati personality at a later time, but failed to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why did Borgati go through the theatrics of transporting to the Stargazer with her face covered, play a song that only had meaning to Picard and then forcefully seize control of the fleet? Because she understood causality had to be fulfilled for the events to play out in the way they did, so her collective could be created and arrive at that point in space and time to use the fleet to stop the emerging transwarp conduit from destroying multiple star systems. Another approach might have resulted in a different outcome.  


Once causality had been fulfilled and events branched by Picard aborting the auto-destruct, she revealed herself and communicated more plainly. Picard S2 - The Borg"
startrek,"One of my favorite parts of the episode was that the alien species literally just wore earth clothes like suits and ties with a few little changes like no pants or embellishments.

I defiantly think this was a deliberate call back to the cheap costumes of old sci-fi where they just had to pull from other costumes to put together the species.

I loved the episode, but this sorta attention to costuming really stood out to me. SNW Alien Costumes are hilarious in a great way"
startrek,"Just wonder how many of you have read the this series and your thoughts about it.

startrek,"I haven't really enjoyed the other new trek shows for all the standard reasons, but I decided to give SNW a try last night. I was very pleasantly surprised! The acting was very good, the tone was just right, the script was very classic Trek, the characters all had good chemistry, it seems like they're gonna give the whole cast chances to shine, it wasn't overly melodramatic, it was inspiring, it was political... All in all it was very good! There area few things I didn't love,a bit too callback/Easter egg heavy a la Disney, but that can be overlooked, and they still used music a bit more often than I would like. But other than that this show has real potential! It seems like the writers of this one have actually seen old trek. I wish this is the one they started with. Anyways I just wanted to share that I really liked it because this is the kind of show that I want to see more of, so I think it's important to support the show and give the powers that be some positive reinforcement. Did you like it? Did you love it? Are you as excited as I am to see more? SNW ep 1 was... really good!"
startrek,"I get the feeling the 'decade away' that Pike is expecting his death to be won't actually take that long to arrive at.  In episode one, his old first officer mentioned the wormhole they stumbled upon, and I'm thinking that might have something to do with getting him to his death sooner.

Anyone else think these might be connected? Prediction about Pike in SNW"
startrek,"The writers have beautifully and creatively found a way to make the scariest and longest running villian of Trek, the Borg, to be effectively ""defeated"". This is something that's been coming for a long time, and I hope there are others who are as excited and touched by this as I am. I'd love to discuss this and it's potentially exciting implications for the future of Trek. 

What's exciting for me is the potential for new seasons and new shows to be somewhat working with the Borg, the fun of seeing what the ""based"" Borg is like, and also the challenge of creating an even worse villian than the OG Borg. I know many dislike the narrative arc style of shows like Picard and Discovery, but the ending of Season 2 feels like a big deal, and we should be excited for the future of Trek canon."
startrek,"The republican party in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin, is likely to win a majority in the Northern Irish elections held on Thursday of this week.

However, where Data is (hopefully) wrong is that the reunification will occur through peaceful means, not terrorism. History according to Data: 2024 Reunification of Ireland seems a little more likely..."
startrek,"By its nature of being a prequel set a few years before another series, Strange New Worlds is in a unique position where we may be able to figure out how long it will be.

The show is set in 2259, with Pike’s promotion to Fleet Admiral happening in 2265, meaning that the last season will likely take place in 2264 before he hands the keys over to Kirk. So that gives us, at most, six seasons to look forward to, and if the current number of episodes per season sticks, 60 episodes. But that’s just my estimate.

How do you think the show will handle this set amount of time to work with? And how do you think they’ll connect to TOS at the end? I think they might do a remake of one of the earliest episodes while showing Pike’s last days before his accident, but it could be anything. How Many SNW Seasons?"
startrek,"I have a question about how the Enterprise gets rid of waste (human or otherwise) as it galivants through the stars. Like, we all know that the Enterprise only has one toilet as demonstrated here by [Commander Riker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAKQzZfpaz8&amp;ab_channel=olewithmilk) but how do all the consumables vacate the ship?

By comparison, as I am sure you are aware in Star Wars lore, it is known practice for a Star Destroyer to empty its waste before entering hyper-space. Surely you see when Han Solo knew that the writers used the waste as a plot point when Solo hid from the destroyers and was tracked by Boba Phet. There is even an entire scene where Luke and friends are being crushed in garbage. 

So why is Star Trek space dumping not a part of the series plot lines or arcs, and what is considered canon or not when it relates to space dumping canon? Space Dump Canon"
startrek,Pike's history montage shows that Earth's near destruction began with 1/6. So are MAGA folks the bad guys in the Star Trek timeline?
startrek,"So, Picard Season 2 has come to an end. The crew gathers one last time as a dying Q prepares to snap them home. But one of them isn't going.

""I'm staying."" Rios says.

No one begrudges him his decision, After all, he's found the family and the love of his life here that he never found in his own time. And with the *La Sirena* having flown off with the Borg Queen, there's really nothing left for him in the 25th century. He was just living by himself with five hgolographic versions of him on an empty cargo ship, right? So, with no remaining baggage, he opts to remain in the past where he is happy. And Patrick Stewart wishes him well, and tells him to 'Make a good future.'

I say 'Patrick Stewart', because Jean Luc Picard... the Jean Luc Picard I grew up with anyway... sure as hell would *not.*

Because Rios is *not* baggage free, is he?

He's *not* the captain of the little freight shuttle *La Sirena* anymore, with a crew of he, himself, and him.

He is the Captain of the Federation Starship *U.S.S. Stargazer,* a ship with a crew of *hundreds* of Starfleet personnel, some of them fresh out of the Academy. A ship and crew that Rios swore an oath to be responsible for as Captain. A ship that he left *in crisis.*

For instance, the fact that as of the moment they were yoinked into an alternate timeline, the ship's self-destruct had been activated? One which only he and Picard would have the authority to override (Possibly the First Officer, but I believe them and most of the bridge crew are, at that point, stunned and unconscious).

Now... remove the time travel angle. If they had just beamed down to an alien world, spent 72 hours there, and Rios had gotten close to one of the inhabitants and decided not to go back... would that fly?

No, of course not. He has made an oath. He has responsibilities. He has people who are depending on him, and his ship is in trouble. It needs its Captain.

Now, perhaps Rios has a good reason? Like perhaps he knew that he had to stay behind in order to give the Doctor and her son the support necessary to back the operation to clean up Earth's oceans?

No... no, we only find that out from Guinan once back home. Nobody knew about that going into this.

Well, maybe he's been moved by the plight of the people in this time, the injustices and struggle, and feels he could make a difference here that he never could as a Starfleet Captain?

No... Rios seemed kinda casual about the whole thing. He seemed more excited about the non replicated food, to be honest.

Well, perhaps he had spent an extended period of time with his new love and her son, and formed real familial bonds, having years pass where it had only been hours for the others and thus showing that there was a deep and solid connection...

Nope, nope... He's only known her for 72 hours. Actually, he's spent considerably less than that with her. In fact, most of that time he spent on a continual adrenaline high as they struggled to try and prevent their timeline from coming apart. I don't think he actually spent any time with her and her son at all that wasn't in some level of crisis mode. I would be surprised if he could tell you her last name without the name tag on her doctor's coat to clue him in.

So... yeah. Rios meets a girl, knows her somewhat *less* well that an average weekend fling for him, decides she's the one he wants to spend forever with, and abandons his ship and command, knowing full well the ship is on the brink of destruction. Oh, and all of this is in clear and direct violation of the Temporal Prime Directive.

I don't *think* the Federation does firing squads for desertion anymore, but I suspect this would cause them to reconsider.

It's such a mind boggling selfish, shallow, unhealthy and even *treacherous* thing for him to do. He's betraying everyone on that ship that were relying on him to get them home, or at least ensure their deaths have some meaning.

If he were to stand before them and explain his decision to them, how do you think they would feel?

If the writers were planning on having him stay in the past (Which was plainly obvious from the moment the Doctor was introduced) the *why* make him the Captain of the *Stargazer!?* Why not just leave him in command of the *La Sirena?* *Star Trek* has always made the center seat of a Starship a big deal, a heavy responsibility, one that is neither handed out willy-nilly, taken up lightly, nor set down easily. It is probably the most important job in the Federation, or at least is portrayed as such. And Rios just tossed it like a used cigar butt.

Captain Kirk went back in time and fell in love. And to protect the timeline and to fulfil his duty *and to ensure he had a ship and a Federation to return to,* he had to watch her die when he could have saved her, or even just allowed her to be saved. Rios went back in time and fell in love, decided to say 'screw it, it's probably destiny anyway' to the timeline, and didn't even bother to check if his ship was going to be okay without him. He didn't even remember to remind Picard to save the *Stargazer* and his crew.

startrek,"CW: Suicide

DS9 understood a LOT of social issues and was ahead of its time. That quote in the title is something that those who have been there understand completely, and is a perfect example of why saying things like “think of the other people in your life” is a really bad counter argument. “You don’t understand, Julian… I’m doing this to protect Keiko… Molly… Everyone else on the station…”"

startrek,"I have three questions about this episode and I was wondering if people could help me out.

Pike and crew avoided jail for breaking General Order One because the incident with Discovery couldn't be acknowledged. But if the incident couldn't be acknowledged, then on paper the Federation hadn't accidentally influenced planet Kiley, and they had therefore spontaneously produced the warp bomb. How can Starfleet command defend Pike et al when they can't explain their actions?

Three seems like a very small crew for a ship the size of the Archer, but I'll accept it for the following reasons: the ship was designed separately to the script writing process, so it looks too big, and also in First Contact, there was a very small number of Vulcans. I also get that from a narrative viewpoint, it makes for a better story when there's a small number. They're easier to capture, so a rescue mission has to be launched etc. But what I don't get is why that would be done from Starfleet's perspective. More specifically, why would they leave a completely empty ship in space. That seems like that would be against protocol except in emergency situations.

Pike's reveal of his ticking clock. I'm a little disappointed that this was revealed to everybody so easily. His revealing to Spock was as much a reminder to the audience as it was a confession between two friends, but I'm not sure why he told everybody else about it in his blog speech.

startrek,One thing I've noticed in the new trek shows is that they often feel like they're rushing through the plot. There was a lot to cover in the first episode. I would have liked to have seen them spend more time on the planet interacting with the aliens and their culture. It was a really good episode with a lot of classic star trek DNA but I hope they slow down and really give each storyline and character arc the time it deserves. The first episode of SNW should have been a two parter. (Minor Spoilers)

startrek,"So, Agnis and the Borg Queen merged into becoming Queen Jurati, with Agnis proposing a more peaceful Borg, a Borg that would no longer force assimilation, but seek to find volunteers to assimilate into a collective that can help the galaxy instead of conquer it like OG Queen did.

Now, Queen Jurati takes the La Sirena back to the Delta Quadrant. The trip from Earth to the Delta Quadrant would take 75 years or more, so from 2024, Queen Jurati should have arrived in Borg space by the 2100s. If this is the case, why was the Borg in VOY and First Contact, set in the years 2371 to 2378, why were they still ""resistance is futile"" and still very much evil.

startrek,"I'm reading through a lot of YouTube comments regarding the current season of Picard and I am seeing so much negativity that seems to be politically charged. 

Yesterday, I made a post asking if Star Trek was considered to be more liberal. Some of you saw it before it was deleted, and instead of engaging thoughtfully, many of you were mean spirited and asked me how I could have seriously asked that. 

Many argued it was more liberal, while taking a sort of written tone that suggested I was an idiot for asking. Others argued it was more colonial and imperialist. 

Well, here is what I think and why I asked a question I already knew the answer to.

It seems the current political climate has colored the view with which many people see things they used to love. Sure, maybe some people still like the old trek because of nostalgia, but so many seem to have forgotten what it always stood for-

Striving for something greater. Discovery. Hope. Equality. Recognizing the rights of those we agree with and disagree with. Hell, they even had moral qualms about destroying the entire Borg collective because they were *better than that*. 

So no, I'm not an idiot. And yes, I do know Star Trek is more liberal in it's ideologies. 

But for those of you who hate Star Trek because you think it became too political or became what you call ""woke,"" well you are objectively wrong. It always has been this way. 

Star Trek didn't change. You changed. Star Trek hasn't become ""woke."" It was always ""woke."""

startrek,"Just been tossing this around in my head from a lore perspective as it appears the so called. ""Golden age."" Of starfleet and the Federation occurred during a time when both the Federation and Klingon were allies; but if the two organizations were to merge or at the very least ally closely in a defensive alliance, one would think it would result in one of the most powerful organizations in the Alpha quadrant or any quadrant for that matter if you disregard the threat of the borg; but the borg are a threat to everyone. 


Let me know what you think would happen if the situation I've proposed were to occur. 

Have a great day! How would the merging of the Klingon Empire and United Federation of Planets effect the balance of power in the Alpha quadrant?"

startrek,"Was Picard Season 2 technically good? No. But I caulk it up almost entirely to pacing. 

Had the same plot been 5 episodes or less I think it would have been very good. 

I won't spoil anything but the first few episodes I felt were quite enjoyable and I enjoyed the finale, had the middle not dragged on forever I think it could have been a snappy TV-movie triology or something.   
I think that after they completely failed to wrap up the Borg B-plot in season 1 they got gunshy about how much plot they wanted to try to squeeze in but still had to make 10 episodes...

Anyway, looking forward to the fan edit. I think there's a good product among the footage, just needs to be edited down to like half the length. There's a really fun three-parter at the heart of Picard S2-- I look forward to the fan edit."

startrek,"I find the time travel plot of PIC S2 to be pretty convoluted, so I wrote down the important events that happen to try to make sense of it, now that we know the entire story. Please let me know of any errors.

* The benevolent Borg Queen Agnes Jurati attempts to stop some temporal radiation, but requires more ships. She hails the Federation for Picard, knowing from first-hand experience that he would recognize her, and is also predestined to come.

* After Picard arrives, Queen Agnes forcibly enters the bridge, takes control of the ship and attacks the crew. Why she does this instead of revealing herself isn't clear, but potentially explained by the fact that she knows this does not matter, as Q will intervene in the last moment to give Picard, Seven, and Raffi the memories of what happened to her.

* Q is dying for an unexplained reason, but does not feel the meaning he expected while dying. As Picard is his ""favorite,"" Q thus endeavors to make Picard feel open to love and accept his mother's suicide from his childhood. Despite this, Q angrily tells Picard this is not a ""lesson,"" but a ""penance,"" and leaves out the specifics of what's happening. Q's plan is to alter time in 2024 by preventing Picard's ancestor from being the first human to discover alien life, with the idea that Picard will time-travel to stop Q, and thus remember that his mother killed herself because he will park the ship by his childhood home.

* Q thus transports Picard (as well as Jurati, Rios, Seven, Raffi, and Elnor for some reason) to an alternate timeline where the Federation is replaced by a fascist human empire. The cast find the Borg Queen, who is revealed to have awareness of timeline changes (like Guinan). The Borg Queen calculates that the timeline diverged in 2024, during which Picard's ancestor is now no longer the first human to discover alien life (an event that none of the cast were ever aware of, for an unexplained reason). Why exactly this results in this specific diversion goes unexplained, but it has something to do with making an evil scientist's  obsolete.

* The cast (with the Borg Queen) use a space ship to travel back in time to 2024. The setting they are in is simultaneously: the malleable alternate past which can be drastically changed by the smallest action (hence Guinan not remembering Picard from a TNG episode, the cast's cautious actions in light of the ""Butterfly Effect,"" and the hypothesis that Picard could have chosen to destroy the skeleton key that he used to inadvertently assist in his mother's suicide), and also the predetermined and unchangeable past of the main timeline (hence Picard remembering the bullet holes they created in his childhood home, Queen Agnes existing for 400 years before the cast traveled back in time, Rios' 21st century life being meant to be, and Guinan always remembering the events of her younger self).

* The cast park the ship at Picard's childhood home. Elnor unfortunately dies, and the rest try to learn more about the temporal divergence from the Borg Queen. As they don't know about Picard's ancestor yet, their only lead is a ""Watcher"" that watches over Picard's ancestor. In an attempt to learn more about this ""Watcher,"" Jurati goes inside the Borg Queen's mind, resulting in the Borg Queen being able to later assimilate Jurati. They eventually get an address for the ""Watcher"" from the Borg Queen, but it turns out to be for the same bar of Picard's long-time friend Guinan that he already knew about.

* Despite this unexplained diversion, Guinan takes Picard to the Watcher, a Romulan named Tallinn who is tasked with protecting Picard's ancestor from the shadows. Picard remarks that Tallinn is completely identical to his flirty housekeeper, which ends up basically unexplained. The two team up, given their mutual goals.

* Around the same time as this, Q attempts to alter reality concerning Picard's ancestor. Assumedly, this has something to do with stopping or hindering her space mission. He supposedly does this knowing that Picard will somehow undo this, and end up in his childhood home so he can explore his trauma. But what Q is trying to do ends up unexplained, as his slow death suddenly deprives him of certain powers. Q thus has to engage in mundane manipulation to stop the space mission.

* Picard and Tallinn notice that Picard's ancestor's therapist is Q, and that he is trying to stop the space mission. It is unclear how long Q has been posing as her therapist. The cast finds out their last opportunity to convince her to go on the space mission is a gala happening right before pre-launch quarantine. After this, no one will be able to reach her.

* While all of this was happening, Rios was transported 30 feet into the air and was thus injured. He ends up at a clinic for undocumented immigrants. After becoming friendly with the head doctor and her son, the clinic is raided by ICE. Instead of escaping, Rios defends the doctor and her son, and ends up being detained by ICE. Rios is brutalized by cruel ICE officers, and put on a bus to be deported with other immigrants.

* Seven and Raffi learn about Rios' situation, and endeavor to save him. While aware of and occasionally mentioning the ""time travel rules,"" Seven and Raffi nonetheless break into an LAPD car, go on a high-speed chase, and eventually transport out. They find the transport bus, but cannot transport Rios in front of others without altering the timeline. They thus use an EMP to stop the bus, knock out the ICE officers, and free all the detainees. Rios remarks that he really likes the 21st century, because of Cuban cigars, real matches, and the doctor he met. He decides to stay in the 21st century after this is over because he likes it and feels he fits in.

* Also while this is happening, Q also recruits the evil  scientist to help him, an ancestor of Data's creator Noonian Soong. Q initially bribes him with a cure for a genetic disease for his cloned daughter, who looks identical to Maddox's Data-based androids from Season 1, thus suggesting that Noonian Soong based Data partially on his evil  ancestor's clone attempts (or on whomever she was cloned from). Q later just bribes the scientist with the promise that altering the timeline will result in great power for him.

* The whole cast goes to the gala to convince Picard's ancestor to go on the space mission. Their plan is somewhat of a success, though Jurati gives more bodily control to the Borg Queen in order to save the rest of the cast. Picard successfully convinces his ancestor, although the Borg Queen in Jurati's body escapes. Then she joins forces with the evil scientist in order to assimilate the galaxy, and goes to a bar to listen to Patrick's 43 year-old wife sing.

* The cast fight Jurati, the scientist, and his soldiers in a battle over the space ship. The soldiers are killed, the cast let the evil scientist go, Picard remembers his mother's suicide, and Jurati tells the Queen that the Borg will lose in every timeline unless they form a new Collective that embraces individuality. This persuades the Borg Queen to unite as the benevolent Borg Queen Agnes. She takes the space ship and waits for Picard back in the 25th century.

* On the day of the space mission, the evil scientist breaks the astronauts' quarantine by telling them that he deserves it for donating. He attempts to kill Picard's ancestor, but Tallinn disguises herself as her and dies instead. The space mission thus happens successfully. Rios fixes every alteration to the timeline he ""could find,"" which is made up of a small bag of 25th century technology.

* The scientist's clone-daughter realizes she's a clone, Q gives her a cure to her disease, and she walks around LA until Wesley Crusher approaches her and asks her if she wants to become a Traveler.

* Q tells Picard that he planned for all of this to happen in order to get Picard to accept his mother's death and open himself to love. They hug, and Q sends the cast back, except Rios, with the doctor and her son. Picard, Seven, and Raffi return to the 25th century, learning that Elnor somehow came back to life. They work with Borg Queen Agnes to stop the temporal radiation. Guinan tells Picard that his ancestor was the first to discover alien life, and she along with the doctor's son used the alien life to solve  (information that no one but Guinan knew for some reason).

startrek,"The borg may be akin to the cybermen, but they are Trek' Daleks, the coldest enemy, iconic since the 80's ... until now, sorry but to have them JOIN THE FEDERATION makes no sense, come on, what is happening here, are the producers intent on having no race of beings be evil ??? how can current Trek be one sense so morbid and not trek in it's grit and random dark events, then the next minute, be offended that some species are evil, at least from our perspective, to do this to the borg should be drawing more ire than then kelvin timeline change.

startrek,"I assumed that she came to this quadrant in Generations, but Picard met her in the 19th century and the 21st century. 21st century Guinan appears younger, but maybe she time-traveled there when she was younger and to the 19th century when she was older. So does Guinan time travel, or what?"
startrek,"Right, spoilers ahead, so I'll blank them, but, can I just say... To DeLancie, Stewart and the writers...

You flipping killed it. Poor choice of words, but... Wow. Wow a million times. Wow, thank you. Damn near teared up.

&gt;! That all of it, all of it was Q, looking out for his human bestie, a gift, a parting effort to leave someone he cared deeply for, better off. For no other reason than because he cared about Picard?

That was phenomenal. Honestly, it was everything I could have wished for, bit never expected. To totally turn around all those years of antagonism.

Then, to see them both accept each other, appreciate each other. To send Q out like that?

Have I said, wow, yet?

Because, wow.

Thank you, all. I LOVED it. And it's one of those rare moments of TV that will be with me forever, and I will enjoy returning to, again and again.

Thank you all. !&lt; Picard S2 Finale - Q - Spoilery Praise"

startrek,"My son and I watched SNW opener last night, and he commented afterward that the series *feels* like Star Trek to him, while (he said) *ST: Discovery* does not. (though he is not a ST:D hater). 

We went around it for a minute or two -- **why** does SNW feel like ST to us, when Discovery does not? He thought maybe Discovery tries to be *too* different. For me, it's my dislike of the Burnham character, I like Pike, I dislike Burnham. But I know that's subjective. But is it true that SNW feels like Trek? What Makes Something ""Feel"" Like Trek?"

startrek,"It's haunting me: i have this vivid memory of a scene of some Sci-Fi episode in my memory and I can't find it. I'm 75% sure it's Star Trek; either TNG or TOS. Can you help me identify it so I can re-watch it and finally settle this unsettling memory - without having to rewatch all of TNG and TOS. Here's what I remember:

    some crew members [max a handful] are on a surface mission. they find an installation [might be an outpost or something alike] and decide to investigate (surprise). They are walking around on the outside and find a part of the complex, that looks like a rather wide silo. For some reason I can't remember they climb into a duct that leads to the inside. They lose grip and slide into the silo. They are stuck and can't get out. Since the silo has some property that blocks comms they can not take the easy way out.

That's basically it - at least in my memory. Any ideas?

And if had it wrong and it's not an actual ST episode at least I know then and maybe my childish memory was playing tricks on me. :D

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: This was probably some time in the early or mid 90s when I saw that on TV (mind, that Star Trek TNG came out in Germany September 1990). Is this story a TNG/TOS episode and if yes which one?"
startrek,"Two things:

Pike, it's ""you have the **conn**"" not ""comm."" Take it from a salty old sea dog.

(This one occurred to me at 5am this morning): the communicators don't make the bird chirp when calling. They make a double beep. The chirp is when the communicator is opened and contact established.

startrek,"I'll probably get down voted for this if anyone even reads it but I just wanted to say a few things. I see a lot of hate on NuTrek/modern trek etc. I'm a fan of old trek. I've tried all of the new shows as well as the modern films and I don't like them. Not for any reason other than difference in tastes. It just isn't what I look for in Trek; much like a film adaptation of a beloved book that goes astray of the writing. That said, I'm very happy to see how many people enjoy everything from the current runs. I love seeing how excited people are for Trek in its latest form and it's so cool to me to see people still talking about this franchise even if it isn't for me. My Trek shows will always be there to re-watch and relive so it's ok for the new audience to take the reigns. I genuinely hope all of you enjoy the continued adventures of the modern crews. Stupid post, I know, but instead of more dumping on your shows I just wanted to see a post out there congratulating you all on being a part of this great franchise. Just wanted to put something positive out there."
startrek,"""...various telescopes..."" so I imagine they had more than optical data from an event 1AU away. Any ideas? How did the people in episode one figure out warp power in three months using data from the telescopes?"
startrek,"Did the Federation excavate the ruins of a Best Buy? Pike must have gone through a lot of trouble to add that to his collection. Didn't television cease to exist as a form of entertainment in the mid 21st Century? 

This did break the realism for me, though. TCL can barely keep a TV running for six months let alone centuries. Captain Pike's antique TCL 55"" flat screen"
startrek,"So I love SNW.  Mainly for the clean, episodic writing and likable cast.  It’s diverse without being preachy about it. In many ways it seems like the truest (non film) update to TOS we have ever had.   Also Young Spock is kind of a playa and I dig that like I dig Bone’s disco medallion in TMP.  How impressive was young Uhura as well!

My very favorite thing about the new show is Captain Pike.  Well written, well acted, noble, and flawed.  Seeing Pike come to grips with his impending disability struck very close to home for me and I imagine does for a lot of disabled Trek fans.  

Five years ago I became disabled and lost my ability to walk for any moderate distance on my own.  My lungs partially collapsed and my spine broke in three places.  But I survived.  These days instead of blazing a trail as trial lawyer I’m chair bound in medical exile at home with my three year old.  I had joked with my super DS9 fan wife that she had ended up married to Captain Pike with his wheelchair.

Seeing Pike wrestle with the knowledge that he is fated to become disabled somehow lends me strength in my own situation.  His struggle to turn his knowledge into strength and be a better captain because of it is inspiring to me.  The fear that he grapples with about what he will become is also very familiar to me.  

I wish he would stop saying that he is fated to ‘die’.  He corrects a few times.  But being disabled isn’t death.  It’s a change of circumstance.  You grow weaker in some ways.  But you also grow stronger in others you may not have anticipated.  It’s a truth you don’t really realize until you get there.  I’m willing to give the writers a pass because I feel like they did the original show justice with SNW.    

He is an inspiring character I am thrilled disabled fans like me can look up to. Pike and SNW from the perspective of a disabled cancer survivor."
startrek, . What's the moral of the story in 'The City on the Edge of Forever'?

startrek,"SNW!!! that opening episode is probably the best in Trek History in terms of all shows and their opening episode!!! exciting to see where it goes now !!!!! wow, so refreshing!"
startrek,"In the opening instead of ""No One Has Gone Before"".  I know why it was changed in the later 23rd century when Kirk switched the phrases, and for out of universe reasons for being more gender neutral terminology, still since this is a prequel to TOS, I wish that classic line was kept.  Similar to how it was used in Enterprise.

The usage of Man in this context is technically gender neutral and unlike ""no one,  references mankind instead of ""insert alien race"".  For stories set mid 23rd century and prior, it helps to further differentiate Starfleet from its later self.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the more current Kelvin films kept the traditional usage of ""Man"".

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe they will given an in universe explanation that some people still use ""No Man has gone before"" in the mid 23d century, especially when Kirk eventually shows up in SNW.  The classic phrase has yet to go out fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts?  Should ""No Man Has Gone Before"" still find use in modern trek that is set prior to the 24th century and 23rd century films?  Or only keep to the newer version? Should ""No Man has Gone Before"" have been used for SNW?"
startrek,"I rarely write posts but I was so compelled to do so after watching the first episode of Strange New Worlds. Holy shit is this a great addition to the Star Trek universe. It pulled on all the Star Trek strings for me. Allegory story telling - check! Nodes to Trek of old - check! Excellent story telling - check!  Seriously, I love all things Star Trek.

Aside from the obvious Uber liberal bs, I thought it was a damn good series, one of my fave of all time tbh. It got me into Star Trek for sure. But seriously from true fan’s perspective I’d like to know why it’s hated. I’m new to Star Trek and I have questions !!!"
startrek,"I grew up in the 2000s watching VHS tapes my Dad made in the 90s of TOS and TNG. What a great intro to sci-fi! As an adult the closest I’ve come to liking Nu-Trek is watching the 2007 reboot and Beyond. Tried watching Discovery and Picard, but they fail to capture what makes Star Trek special. Hope, optimism, bright colours, the spirit of exploration … people coming together to solve timeless problems that each of us have our own window into - that’s what nu-Trek has been missing. I think we had a glimpse of it the 2007 movie and Beyond, but this is the first pilot that makes me believe 21st century Star Trek can be something other than a bleak imagination of our future. I can’t wait to see more, this pilot at least proves that it’s possible to make new Star Trek that brings back those warm feelings I oh so missed! Strange New Worlds is the Trek I’ve been waiting for since I was a kid"
startrek,"I've been searching for one of these for years now, they never came to NZ so I never even knew they existed til well after they were all sold out \*sigh\*

startrek,I think it’s “Death wish” What’s the best Q episode
startrek,"&gt;!so everyone was saying the reason that Guinan did not remember Picard from their time travel exploits in the 1800’s is because of the alternate future that they came from where they never went back in time… except at the end of the season it was revealed that the events of the season always happened (bullets in wall, Guinans memory, Rios’ photo that was always there..) it was a linear unchanged timeline. So that means that the future still existed.. and so did their “times arrow” travel to the past!&lt; Spoiler: Picard season 2: so she should have remembered after all!"
startrek,"How Kirk would had dealt with the Gorn... If it had been a female? TOS ""Arena"" What if...?"
startrek,"In all versions of the U.S.S Enterprise the people at the  helm are wearing command division yellow (TOS, Kelvin movies, Disco) so why for Strange New Worlds are they engineering/security red? Shouldn't Lt. Ortegas be wearing yellow?  Did I miss an explanation for this? I know it can't be because the weapons are routed to the helm cause the person to her left was in red too. Strange New Worlds Helm Question."
startrek,"I haven't enjoyed anything since Enterprise.  I had high hopes that Strange New Worlds would be a return to form.  What I watched was not Star Trek, just a mediocre imposter using the name.  I guess it'll just be endless rewatches of the only five series that exist. Welp, I'm Out"
startrek,"I guess three days in the past is enough to make some captains abandon their ship and crew in the future. It's like if Kirk, in ""The City on the Edge of Forever,"" decided nah, he was just going to stick around with Edith Keeler. Rios &amp; the Stargazer"
startrek,"I'm looking for right after the show airs discussion podcast for SNW. I listened to The Podcast Maneuver for Picard but I don't like that they listen to a few episodes ahead.

Thanks, Podcasts discussing Strange New Worlds?"

startrek,"As we know Kirk and Spock have been recast twice, with the Kelvin movies and then again with Discover and Strange New Worlds (Kirk will be appearing eventually and has been cast).

However nostalgia is a cycle, and Next Generation has been at that point for a long time. Do you think we'll ever get to the point where we'll see new actors take on the mantle of Picard, Riker, Data, etc. in their younger years as a prequel to Next Gen or what they were doing before? I get the feeling it might happen eventually. I know people can't see Patrick Stewart recast, but people said the same about Leonard Nimoy as Spock....twice...and he's been recast twice with younger actors. Will we ever get to the point where Picard, Riker and Data are recast with new/young actors like Kirk and Spock?"
startrek,"Picard season 2 was very disappointing again just like season 1. It was a bit better than season 1 plot wise but still very disappointing. I was so hyped when the first episode released and we saw Rios as Captain of the Stargazer. So excited to see him taking in the role of command. Then they took him away before even giving us enough time to see his captaincy. Then they make the Borg, one of the Federation’s most feared and unnegotiable enemies allies? What utter nonsense the whole season has been. The only light was seeing Wesley Crusher again and even that was for 5 minutes and had nothing to do with the over all plot. They could’ve cut that scene out and it wouldn’t have affected it in any way. Why do the writers chose to write such random crappy plots with such great characters and history. Once again Picard is worse to me than Discovery. I just hope they don’t raise my hopes for Strange New Worlds and crash them. The first episode was good but I’m holding my breath that it doesn’t turn out like Picard. Disappointed again"

startrek,"I’m wondering if Guinan was on Earth with her bar still in business in  the 2250s and 2260s when Pike and later Kirk was captain of the  Enterprise, even though the Borg assimilated her homeworld during that  era and she was later one of the refugees rescued by the Enterprise-B in  Generations?  Maybe Guinan was on Earth when the Borg attacked her home  planet and only traveled away from Earth to help surviving refugees  after she learned about the destruction of her homeworld. Guinan might not have known it was the Borg until she talked to other El-Aurians? 

I think it would be interesting if Guinan has a cameo in SNW with Captian Pike in her bar since there’s no on-screen evidence Picard was the only captain of Enterprise Guinan ever met and talked too.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Guinan was on Earth with her bar during ENT in the 2150s while Archer was captain of the NX-01, though Archer’s crew spent most of their time in and around San Francisco while they were on shore leave. Guinan and her bar in the mid-23rd century?"

startrek,The new show is off to a great start. SNW was awesome!
startrek,"Their shorter miniseries format with both shows telling season-long self-contained stories has more in common with the movies than any of the series.

I feel that Picard 2 is better than Insurrection and Nemesis, but not as good as Generations and First Contact, for example. Discovery and Picard should be compared to the movies rather than the other series."
startrek,"I know it sounds like I am making a joke but I really would like to know.  I noticed in episode 1 of Strange New Worlds that when they catch up with Pike, he is riding a horse.  The other series/movies show Picard and Kirk also had an affinity for horses.  Does anyone know if this is mere coincidence or was i planned that all Enterprise captains would be horsemen? Horses?"
startrek,"So In the 2009 movies, let me know if im wrong, but I believe Spock was about the same age as Kirk.  But in the new Strange new worlds, he serves with Pike way before Kirk came along. Am I getting this wrong or is it a different timeline? Confused about Spock"
startrek,"Hey yall! So I'm going to watch the premiere today with some friends whom are not up to speed on Discovery, and thus don't know a lot about Pike. Does the pilot explain that he knows his future and why? I want to make sure they don't feel too lost. 
If it doesn't I'll probably show them a scene or two idk. SNW question for first time viewers SPOILERS FOR DSC"
startrek,"I get setting the Gorn up and an inhuman antagonistic species. It works, that misconception is the whole point of the episode that they appeared in (Arena? Bout to go watch it again). Have no issue with them feeding their young captives, but in SNW they mention then using humans as breeding socks? 

That seems a bit of a stretch to make it as horrible and inhuman as possible and drastically changes the species, from an uncaring, xenophobic, protectionist species to something more akin to Alien. I feel like you could've had the trauma she had without tracking this onto the species. Doing the Gorn dirty."
startrek,"La'an was actually one of my favorite characters in the pilot. Her story is real interesting, the actor does a great job with it, but her stupid last name was such a dumb idea. She could have been anyone - someone like Tasha Yar who grew up on a shitty planet and who was rescued by Starfleet, she could have just been a badass scrappy security officer we come to love as we get to know her, but no - they had to add Star Trek's most overused character to her lore, and now it's a whole thing. I wish they would just stay away from Khan and the Eugenics Wars from now on. We don't need any more. He wasn't that big of a villain in TOS or in the movies - he was a personal foil to Kirk, and now it's been blown up way out of proportion and everything has to be Khan related.

What other Trek storylines are you finished with? Badmirals? Mirror Universe? Borg origins? I love SNW, but I never want to see anything about Khan ever again in any shape or form - La'an didn't need to be a Noonien Singh to be interesting. What other Trek storylines do you never need to see/hear from again?"
startrek,"He knows exactly when, where and how he dies, so surely he knows exactly how to avoid it, right? Refuse a promotion, quit Starfleet and retire to a peaceful life, etc. If Pike now knows what happens to him, why can’t he simply ‘quit’ Starfleet when he leaves the Enterprise or even refuse the promotion?"
startrek,"Ok, so the new episode of SNW seems to contradict that the eugenics wars take place in the 90's. Based on Pike's speech and our own recent history, Star Trek's pre-warp earth timeline seems to be this: Facists take over republican party sometime in the 2000s or 2010s leading to Trump/ capitol insurrection on Jan 6th, leading to an eventual 2nd American civil war in the mid/late 2020s (based on Picard S2 taking place in '24 and it being mostly normal) culminating in the eugenics wars and finally a nuclear WW3 by the 2050s. So clearly, this changes things up to incorporate modern events. What do we think about this? Is there any way to resolve it within canon? Current thoughts on timeline of Eugenics Wars/ WW3?"
startrek,Is there any discussion to be had on this? Or is every thread going to be locked? Picard s02e10
startrek,"Really didn’t expect the Borg would agree with Federation…

Last episode of Star Trek Picard Season 2 would make Janeway proud 🥰 Now we finally know where the magical programmable matter and wide spread usage of transwarp conduits in Discovery is coming from"

startrek,"Picard S2E10. Project Khan. What is everyone thinking?

The Ugenics Wars happened in the 90's which led to the ban on genetic modification that made Soong's work so illegal to begin with.

It this a seed for Picard S2 to pick up? A tie-in with SNW's new Security Officer? I'm so what perplexed as to the meaning/implication of this reveal.

This is just for my own reasons. They obviously don't answer to any names. I just like having a little family of Trek animals. Haha. a fox named Laal"
startrek,"Wesley returns as a Traveller in an awesome bridging of Trek mythos where we learn ""Travellers"" assign the Supervisors like Gary Seven and Tallin to keep tabs on time-orientated anomalies in the physical realm throughout worlds across history.

The elephant in the room is that we now know Wesley became an actual Traveller and not just The Traveller's companion. So why did Wesley appear as a Lt in NEM at Troi and Riker's wedding. There's also a deleted scene where he announces he's taken a position in Engineering on the Titan.

I know there's been some rational in the books as to this disparity suggesting Wesley's appearance, it either seemed too mental (turning up naked expecting a Betazoid traditional ceremony) or too regressive for Wesley's character development.

u/Wil approval of God needed, but could we be cool with the possibility that Wesley simply took a break to observe the physical world (reactivating his commission) for a stretch, much in the same way The Traveller did before him when he worked as Kadzinski's assistant?

This would kind of sit better than randomly turning up naked expecting a Betazoid wedding and borrowing somebody else's niform in an era of replicators. Pic Finale Spoilers: A travelling disparity or pit stop situation"

startrek,"Ok - so does Agnes form her own collective somewhere different from the Delta quadrant and that's what appears in Picard S2E1?

We know it's not the same Borg as Q Who, BoBW, or First Contact so how does Agnes Borg fit in with them ir does that mean that this (Picard) establishes an alternate future from the TNG world?

startrek,"In STW, Spock gets a call and leaves in the middle of potential sexytimes? I thought they'd die if they did 'restore balance' so to speak? Have they changed it in recent times and I missed it or is it an unaddressed deviation from canon? Is Pon farr not a thing anymore?"
startrek,"I'm almost completely new to Star Trek (just finished TOS) so I'm sorry if this question have been asked too many times.
From my own research I conclude that despite bad reviews TMP is worth a watch but only the director's edition. That's a shame because I have no access to that version of the movie.
So should I just watch the theatrical version anyway? Is it really so much worse compare to the director's edition? The visual praise and the comparison to 2001: A Space Odyssey (one of my favorite movies) definitely intrigued me. Should I watch the theatrical version The Motion Picture?"
startrek,"Granted, I know this is the first episode of a new series so, they pulled out all the stops but, the episode was *really* good. This reminded me of the TNG I grew up with and loved. I am actually relieved that we didn’t get introduced to some galactic calamity that some how, ONLY the crew of the enterprise is able to solve and it’s going to take 10 episodes to solve it. 

In my opinion, PIC season 2’s weakest point was pacing. Really, the entirety of season 2 feels like we could have gotten to the finale in 5 or 6 episodes. That’s serialized contents hardest point to get right and it can make or break a season. Move too quick and fans are left asking how the how did we get here. Move too slow and fans forget for a week or two that new episodes even dropped. Episodic content can be 5, 10, 20 episodes so long as the writing can keep producing good hour long stories.

I guess what I’m getting at is, for the first time since maybe, season 1 of DSC, I’m looking forward to more than just the season premier and finale. I really find it hard to understand why Trek went away from the episodic format. SNW Ep. 1 shows just how good they can be"
startrek,"I firmly believe that she is a descendant of Khan, however, just like our IRL Khan, left a genetic legacy in millions of descendants, therefore I believe her history can be tied back to the man, with just 3-4 generations between the two. 

&amp;#x200B;

The information is: 

1. There is an (unconfirmed) report of Gorn. 

2. She's skittish around people reading her file (about the incident).

 

La'an killed her family. The reason, however, depends on information yet to be revealed. However, the information listed before leads me to 3 conclusions:

Therefore, I have concluded that it's possible that La'an:

1) Killed her family as an act of mercy, being turned into a breeding sac sounds...unpleasant. Unaware of the Gorn tradition of returning the survivor to space

2) Killed her family after becoming aware of the tradition. 

and lastly, which is a bit out there,

3) Killed her family, as a ""survival of the fittest"" test as part of a group of last descendants of Khan group. This is only here because of the unconfirmed report, and it sounds on brand for Augments. (SNW THEORY) La'an is lying about her backstory."
startrek,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I did not like Picard season two. The plot felt tired and re-hashed, and after season one I was hoping for more former TNG cast members to make an appearance. The show itself felt like a sad stab at nostalgia and I actually started to dislike the Picard character who I enjoyed much more on TNG. And for a sad stab at nostalgia, not having any other former cast members except Brent Spiner and John de Lancie, frankly I felt ripped off. Don't get me wrong, I love Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine, who got even better, more rich and textured, great character development, but I kept hoping to see LeVar Burton or Colm Meaney or anyone really, for a show arc that literally and figuratively went to the past it would have been very nice to see old faces along the way. I may be nit-picking but this was a wasted effort overall, so many questions could have been answered regarding the rest of the galaxy in this show, but I guess tired old tropes win the day instead. I suppose I may have had my expectations too high, anyone else have this issue? Did the show Picard fail?"

startrek,"Alright, I don't post often but I wanted to take a minute and say how absolutely thrilled I was with the finale of this season! There was no wrap up rushing and I felt they tied up every thread I had questions on perfectly. Below are a few thoughts that I wanted to share:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. When I grew up with TNG, I was young. Between about 8 and 12 years old catching reruns with my brother and cousin (both teenagers.) As such, I never got onto the whole ""annoying Wesley Crusher"" band wagon that seemed to permeate those who watched it and even on my re-watch a few years ago I never felt like he was annoying or a terrible part of the show. He was a point of view character for me growing up that nobody else could provide and I was sad to see him leave the show. Having him return as the explanation not only of what he's been up to but the ""where do the watchers come from?"" questions I had was perfect. I'm so glad Wil got to be on the show again, especially after not seeing him announced for season three. Also Kore was a character I wanted to see a resolution for and having her join the travelers was perfect.
2. I'll admit it, I teared up at Q and Picard's final scenes. I always knew the Q liked Picard and showed it off like a standard elementary school kid would a crush, but hearing him say it and letting Picard let go of his frustration and help out a frenemy (at worst. At best a friend) was beautiful. A great send off for the character and something that still brings a small tear to the eye when I think about it.
3. A perfect setup for the next Picard season, or even a new show in the new timeline (Stargazer with 7 as captain exploring the other side of the conduit please!) While it was the most rushed part of the finale in my opinion it is clearly meant as our teaser for future events which I cannot wait to explore. Is this the AI that was called last season? Who knows! I just know I'm stoked to see what happens next.
4. Its honestly been refreshing to see Picard so vulnerable and open this season. I'm glad his character was able to move beyond his stoicism and finally let some people into his life that he cares about.
5. Elnor's back! That's all. Just happy about it and I hope he gets more to do next season.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly that's it. No complaints, no questions, no asking for extra comments. I really just felt the need to put some words down about it and share my love for the finale and this franchise as a whole. It's not always perfect, but it always brings a smile to my face.

&amp;#x200B;

Live long and prosper my friends! Let me gush about Picard Season 2 Finale (Spoilers!)"

Season 2: Double down on Q. Have him send Picard through multiple timelines. Coalition. Locutus. Oh hey, here's a surprise cameo-filled Dominion one with him leading the Resistance against Weyoun. And here's a wacky meta episode where he's Patrick Stewart bitching about being too old to still be doing this.

startrek,"Watching Star Trek be defiled over and over again for the past… 20 years? From Enterprise, to the Abrams movies, to discovery, and now the worst tv show I have ever watched. If you like this I’m happy for you but I’m just confused. Why can’t it just be about a utopian future? Gene Roddenberry would be so upset to see what happened to his vision. It’s like watching a childhood role model become a drug addict and end up on the street. Shame on you Patrick. I know the check is huge but where’s your morality? Picard has made me depressed."
startrek,"It was via zoom. My background was the bridge of the Enterprise D. It was glorious. 

“Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived.” Today I used a Picard quote for the moment of inspiration in my Rotary meeting."
startrek,"So I realize this is likely to be an unpopular opinion, but I feel like the recent episode of Picard, where Jurati talks to the Borg Queen about changing her ways, solved the issues I've always had with the Borg.

The Borg, despite claiming to want to take in the biological and technological uniqueness of the species they assimilated never really seemed to do that. Outside of one or two off hand comments about the Hirgoen or Hazari making good tactical drones, all we see of the Borg is that every species, regardless of their abilities, become a copy paste drone that ignores any sort of specialized role said species could fulfill to make the Borg actually stronger.

This homogenization has also created the Borg's most glaring weakness, their lack of ability to actually adapt to situations as they encounter them. The Borg are notoriously unable to really adapt to any new situation beyond just sending more Cubes at the problem. This has allowed numerous species in the Delta Quadrant, where the Borg have been around for 1000+ years, avoid total assimilation, and has allowed the Federation to defeat them time and time again with clever tactics.

It also ignores basic about biology that a more diverse pool to draw from is inherently more useful for a specie's survival.

The methods that they use to go about this, i.e. forcible assimilation, has naturally caused large scale galactic resistance against the Borg, which has resulted in the deaths of untold numbers of drones, and cubes, and overall been a negative for the Borg's overall plans then had they gone about it any other way. It also would invariably lead to their own end, as this recent episode of Picard pointed out, and as Voyager showed with Species 8472, due to the Borg eventually riling so many people, or one powerful group of people, up enough to make a force that could stop them.

The idea that a quasi-machine race, that has assimilated members of over 10,000 species, would be so stupid as to fail such a basic biology lesson, and basic tactics lessons, has always been one of the sore points of Star Trek for me. Nothing they ever did ever made sense in regards to their stated goals, since everything they did directly ran against it. They were just belligerent for the sake of having a belligerent enemy, rather then because they needed to be, or should be the way that they were.

Jurati's talk with the Borg Queen in Episode 9, where she basically tells the Borg queen ""why don't you just not do what you have been doing, and actually embrace people's uniqueness"" was such a franchise aware moment IMO. Its like the writers knew ""yeah the Borg were dumb, lets tell them how they are being dumb and have them stop being dumb"". 

I loved it so much, and am glad SOMEONE finally said it in universe. Star Trek Picard S2 EP9 solved the Borg problem, and is a very franchise aware moment"

startrek,"I never watched Star Trek before and really wanted to get into it.

startrek,"I never liked gangster movies/stories, but ""A Piece of the Action"" was actually a lot of fun to watch.

I'm going through TOS to try to find episodes my kids will like, so I'm watching with a different perspective than usual, and I'm picking up things I didn't expect. This episode, specifically, has some great details, and I just wanted to share some thoughts.

* When the kid runs up the steps to create a distraction so Kirk and Spock can incapacitate the armed guards at the doors, one of those guards makes the funniest ""Oh, no, I'm passing out!"" face I've ever seen.
* Kirk himself doesn't know the rules of Fizzbin. He deals two Jacks to the guy, tells him that's a good thing, but getting a third Jack on the next deal is bad. Seconds later, he deals that dreaded third Jack, but he tells the guy it's a ""lucky"" and ""wonderful"" thing.
* The chances of drawing three Jacks in a row are very slim (worse than 1 in 2000, if my Google results are accurate).
* Kirk starts speaking in that gangster accent partway through the show. It gets stronger and more nasal with every scene. It's clear he's having fun with it.
* In some of the outside scenes, I kind of get the impression that the writers came up with this story while looking at existing sets in other parts of the studio lot and thinking up ideas for episodes that wouldn't require building new sets.

I understand now why some people include this episode in their list of TOS favorites. A Piece of the Action (TOS 2-17)"
startrek,"Years ago when I was working nights I'd come home tired and wanting to unwind with an episode of Star Trek, but I always tended to pick my favourites -- nothing wrong with that but I thought it would be nice to randomly select an episode.

[This](https://www.online-python.com/dHkoVsXS1r) script selects a random episode from a random season of a random show. Eventually I'd like to somehow include the actual episode titles and allow the user to input a variable (like if I wanted a random episode from a show I select). But otherwise this works.

I mean Edi-Krall obviously knows the main bridge is the nerve Center of any starship and it’s in this lovely raised bump in the middle of the saucer section for all to see, they had no problem being selective of what and with how many Bees to strike, and you wouldn’t even need a full wave, just have a couple puncture it like the Scimitar did to the Ent-E in Nemesis when it blew the main viewscreen out. 

So if you’re trying to disable a ship as soon as possible, why not just slice the bridge off while you’re at it? “Cut its throat!”…but no “off with its head!”?"
startrek,"So I just turned on the ""star trek"" channel on the ""big screen VR"" app on my quest 2.. so I pop into the front row as an intro sequence to a tng episode begins..

And in the last flyby the Enterprise makes, before it says ""created by gene Roddenberry"", you can actually see the crew moving around in the bubble area on top of the ship.

I was mind blown by the attention to detail. Has that always been there? Is it only visible when you've got the equivalent of a massive display in front of your eyes? Incredible detail in the tng intro I'd never noticed before"

In Star Trek literature, I'm currently up to Voyager - Atonement, however lurking around on the web and I've stumbled across this.

Would this be the best reading order for the Star Trek books post Nemesis?

I've already read the Destiny (four books) and pre-Destiny saga, but I don't mind jumping back to get look at the time before.

startrek,"Now that we have Adrian Holmes live-action Robert April can we get a Remastered TAS now? :D

:D On Robert April..."
startrek,"In the TNG episode ""The Measure of a Man"", Data's right to autonomy and status as a sentient (technically, sapient) being is called into question. A starfleet admiral holds a trial requiring the first and second officers of the Enterprise to act as counsel. Picard is assigned to defend Data which he gladly accepts. Riker is assigned to argue against Data's personhood, and he initially refuses, stating that he would never argue against Data's personhood, because he would not believe in what he's arguing, and that Data is his friend. The admiral pontificates that sometimes people will be in situations where they ""need"" to argue for a position they don't personally hold, and that if he refuses, she will summarily rule against Data.

This always bothered me but I couldn't put my finger on it the first time I watched the episode. Now, I realize that the issue lies in the concept of a conflict of interest. 

In real legal systems, a lawyer generally cannot have conflict of interest in the case they're arguing. If they truly don't believe in what they're arguing, or if they have a personal relationship with the person they're arguing against, those absolute would count as conflicts of interest. It wouldn't be fair to the person they're representing, and wouldn't result in a completely fair trial, which people should have the right to. Even if they genuinely make every effort to block out their personal thoughts on this case, it will still subconsciously affect their performance. In this case, yes, as Riker says in the episode, they'll have to find someone else do fill the position.

And what's with ruling summarily if Riker refuses? Imagine if that happened at a real life trial: ""Oh, your opponenr can't find a lawyer that will represent them? Guess they win!"" That shouldn't happen. What's stopping them from deferring the trial until they can find proper counsel? Why the rush? Actually, that was the excuse they used for forcing Picard and Riker, who aren't trained lawyers, to represent this trial in this first place, that the starbase they're at is brand new, and there isn't enough staff for a proper hearing. Then wait for more staff? If you want a fair trail, you can't rush through it? You need to wait until you're capable of holding a fair trial!

And even if you say ""oh Starfleet is a military organization, and military trials are different from civilian trials"". Except they're not currently at war, so they have no logistical reason to hold any sort of emergency tribunals, and also, rulings relating to human rights (or android rights) should absolutely not be made in a military court. It probably shouldn't even be made in a regular trial court, but by the supreme court.

All in all, even though this was still a very powerful episode due to what actually happened in the trial, the opening and premise didn't make much sense. A proper legal system shouldn't have operated like that, let alone a Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communist society. The trial should have waited until the proper staff can be acquired.

What do you think? Agree? Disagree? Why or why not? Other thoughts?

Here's a video a real lawyer made on this episode, which also addressed this issue: https://YouTube.com/watch?v=XVjeYW6S8Mo TNG, ""The Measure of a Man"": Riker should not have been forced to argue against Data."
startrek,"I have choosen star trek as one of the IPs om analysing in a school project. I was wondering what to I should watch since we had to pick one specific piece of media. it preferably needs to be on netflix, HBO, or disney+ What movie to watch and analyse"
startrek,"This might be because I only have experience up to ds9 and voyager, but it feels like the later parts of Star Trek I see start undermining the restrictions that the federation placed on their officers. Something I loved about TNG was that they had accountability, something that had carried over from TOS imo, but DS9 throws that out the window. 

The egalitarian nature of it all, the moral exploration persists, but a believable code of conduct seems to have been lost. Do you guys think that it is just part of the progression of the universe, the wars reshape what is tolerated, or is this just something that was dropped by writers who wanted to free characters to take on their own personalities? Either way I feel it’s a loss to the universe, especially given how the old equally considered, mutually grey positions have been slowly giving way to black and white conflicts that require about as much character development as your average breen. The role of the federation"
startrek,"Obviously not a lot of material out there. But the great news is you don't have to pick out sevens seasons and four films on what to rewatch from TNG if you did it for Picard lol.

I don't have the time (or interest) to rewatch all of Discovery season 2 but I made a decent list of what to watch and doing it in order:

\-Q and A (Short Treks)

\-The Cage (I mean yeah. Watched it before DIS season 2 started too).

Five pivotal Discovery episodes:

\-Brother

\-If Memory Serves

\-Through the Valley of the Shadows

\-Such Sweet Sorrow parts 1 and 2

I think it covers the basics! Anyone else is doing something similar? Anyone else doing a Pike rewatch before Strange New Worlds begins?"
startrek,Simple. By not listening to what most of you have say. How do I enjoy any of the new Star Trek shows?
startrek,"Need the communities help, does anyone else have DS9 Season 5 purchased on iTunes or via another service?  When watching on Apples service this season seems as though it’s not interlaced properly and very pixelated. I sent a complaint to Apple and going down the Support rabbit hole but not expecting much. 

I thought about subscribing to Paramount Plus and comparing the diff, maybe send Apple a pic comparing so they may do something about it. Anyone else been down this rabbit hole before?

I’ll come back later and try to add a pic for comparison. DS9 Season 5 - iTunes version pixelated or not properly deinterlaced?"
startrek,"I think I might get nailed to the wall for asking this, but I think by now most of us really can say Picard S2 as a whole felt very underwhelming despite a great start. Many of the community are placing blames on the writers, but could Patrick Stewart be partially responsible too?

The reason I ask is I believe in some interviews pre-S1, Stewart mentioned his condition to playing Picard again is to not be the captain of a starship again. Some reports also mentioned he was also very involved in the story writing early on. If so... could it be possible that Stewart might have directly influenced the direction Picard is (being far less sci-fi and Trekie than we liked) going and would become partially responsible for poor storywriting?

I really hope I can be proven wrong, but the horrible thought that maybe it could be Stewart who prevented Picard from being great (or at least what most of us really wished it to be) just wouldn't go away. Patrick Stewart's role on Picard series story?"
startrek,"Just finished episode 9 of Picard. Jurati refers to the Borg queen having seven be one of her best, but this is not the same Borg queen and seven is not the same person she was in the original timeline. I guess you could argue that Jurati wasn't thinking of that, but it was written at such an important character speech that I'm sure it was writer error. 

After that, she convinces Borg queen to go and change the collective. Now correct me if I'm wrong but does that not completely alter the timeline, this negating this entire season's plot point to stop Q from changing everything? I can see how that helps but that would entirely ruin some parts of TNG and really a great part of the Star Trek universe.

Not only that but I'm gonna point out that all the things that people have listed as being wrong with this season cannot be explained as ""oh this is a different timeline"". That doesn't make sense; the timeline shift happens when the Europa mission was changed, that is the shifting point that caused the chain of events to create the confederation. Otherwise them doing anything within this entire travel back in time thing doesn't matter because the timeline will have already changed. 

Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed more this season than season 1, this was just a little rant I had in my head that's been bothering me. 

If I misunderstood anything feel free to correct me (aside from the argument that this is another timeline, it's a bad excuse for poor writing and not fact checking against canon). Do the writers understand how different timelines work"
startrek,"  

I wanted to add my thoughts to the Captain April casting. Recently for my blog I have started reviewing the Animated Series which I haven’t seen since I was a kid. So far, my thoughts are both “these stories are awesome and amazing” and “my god this animation sucks.” You might compare the animation to the graphics in TOS but the difference is TOS graphics were excellent for their time, they even won a few awards. They only look cheap in comparison, whereas TAS animation was poor even for the time. 

However, the stories are compelling. So recently they cast Adrian Holmes as Captain Robert T. April, a character who was only appearance was in the last episode of TAS. So, Holmes is black and the animated April was white. Now this has upset two bases of people: racists and those fans of TAS who think it is being decanonized again. 

My argument is on TAS the tribbles were pink and not brown and none of the characters pointed this out. The delta on crew’s shirts on TAS has a hard time pointing up. They point right or left and sometimes appear on the wrong side. In short, my view is this: while I see TAS **stories** as cannon I don’t count any TAS **visuals** as canon.  So, I am looking forward to Mr. Holmes performance. My Thoughts on the New April casting"
startrek,"So getting into Star Trek, I decide to go with the release order. Start with TOS, then TOS cast movies, then TNG up to season 5, then start going back and forth with DS9 season 1, TNG season 6, so on and so forth.

I've gone up to Star Trek 3, the Search for Spock, and things are feeling really weird. I'm not sure why, but it seems like I'm not on the same wavelength as the rest of the Star Trek fandom. The more I read from Star Trek fans, the more weird I feel. I've read a lot about how season 1 of TOS is the best one, with the subsequent seasons declining. But for me, season 2 was the best of TOS. Most of my fave episodes are from that season.

But now it's carrying on to the movies. I loved the first one, only to find out it's considered one of the worst Star Trek movies. Second one I enjoyed along with everyone else. But I've just finished Star Trek 3, and I disliked it quite heavily. The story just felt too silly and ridiculous with Spock's soul being transferred to McCoy, while his body is turned back into a boy, who then rapidly ages to become old Spock again, so they can cut and paste his soul back to old Spock. But according to reviews from Star Trek fans I've been reading, this movie is underrated and is the exception to the ""odd numbered original Star Trek movies are bad"" rule.

It's like I'm really out of sync with the Star Trek fandom consensus. And with the all the series coming back into the picture, I've heard from some fans about how much I'll hate the first 2 seasons of TNG, but love the rest of it, and DS9 is the best series etc. But the fact that I'm already not on the same page with Star Trek fandom what I've already seen makes me worried I won't feel the same as everyone else about all that.

I'm debating not really interacting the any reviews or analysis of whatever Star Trek thing I'm watching now, just go through it all on my own. It seems like I'm destined to be an unusual Star Trek fan. I think I'm watching Star Trek wrong."

Anyone else think this one is a great episode? Enterprise episode “The Seventh” is the best one so far."
startrek,"I really want to, I really want to understand the appeal. 

The thing is I was a child in the late 80s and I practically grew up with TNG. As far as I am concerned TNG ""IS"" StarTrek. 

Compared to TNG, TOS just feels very dated, and not in a good way. The bridge looked plastic ( I actually liked the hotel like and cozy appearance of the enterprise-D), the effects were bad, the music forgettable (The main theme with the weird voice even sounds laughable to me).

The acting was bad, the costumes cringey , the Klingons looked like people with bronze makeup. And whats with all the sexist crap. Also, what with finding planets that are carbon copies of historical periods of Earth, never found those stories convincing.

What am I missing ? I tried the other night to watch a season 3 episode with ""evil children"" and just couldn't finish it. 

Perhaps TNG spoiled me for TOS. How can I get into TOS better ?"
startrek,"Hope I can share this, if this isn't allowed feel free to take it down. 

I'm learning to code in Python and thought this would be an interesting project: a script that would randomly select an episode of Star Trek. Years ago I'd come home from work late at night and want to watch some Trek to unwind, and always spent a long time trying to decide which episode to watch -- I always thought it would be convenient to have some sort of program to randomly select one. 

So I wrote [this](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) and wanted to share! (Incidentally, if anyone seeing this knows Python and has ideas on how to improve it I'd love to hear them). Next step is to create a table with episode titles so it would print that instead of the name, but for now this works like a charm! Random Episode Generator -- a pet project"

Live Long and Prosper! SNW characters recreated in Star Trek Online 😊"
startrek,"I think it's great that Robert April is played by a black actor. But obviously the Elephant in the room is ""TAS is canon because XYZ"". Personally, given how far-fetched animated shows usually are (they are designed for kids or exist as comedy for other demographics) and the fact that none of the events of TAS have ever been mentioned in subsequent shows in the franchise (excluding LD, which is the same deal - animated), it's relatively easy to see what the intentions were from latter show runners and scriptwriters.

We've seen complete ignorance for TAS, including Star Trek V wherein the magical people at the centre of the Galaxy have disappeared and a barrier has appeared (this was subsequently ignored by The Nth Factor, wherein there was no barrier, but giant talking heads persisted) in place.

I can't post this in Daystrom because the ""canon"" thing. So I'll post it in here:

If we're adhering to canon, then the V'Ger cloud is larger than the solar system (at 82 AU's.) That was retconned by TMP director's edition. Nobody had any problem accepting a detail like this, because it made a lot more sense to the setting. 

The same applies for Robert April, who was a prototype Pike/Kirk that GR outlined when pitching the series. This is followed in his singular appearance in TAS, wherein he's a swap of Kirk's animation model. In other media, photographs of GR were used to represent April (completely non-canon.) By making April an original character that isn't a GR placeholder or a random palate swap of Kirk, they are doing something that makes sense for a featured (and most-probably) highly important guest role. Thus April could be any ethnicity, it just so happened that Adrian Holmes (the showrunner's choice) is a black man.

I think if people are truly pissed at the idea that TAS probably stretches ""canon"" a bit too much, they could remaster the visuals of TAS, and make April resemble Adrian Holmes. This probably would be a profitable venture if Paramount put up the cash to do it. But that doesn't change the fact that TAS has had very little bearing on the overall continuity of Star Trek, and thus it doesn't matter that their depiction of April is a white man. Canon - Ta Da!! Time to remaster TAS?"
startrek,"I love listening to smart/funny/insightful folks react to and critique stuff that I love but have had a hard time finding good stuff in that area for Trek. 

I used to watch a lot of the Trekyards channel but honestly have found them more and more insufferable as time has gone on. I love ships, I love canon, I don't need people to lavish praise on the shows that I like, but their whole vibe just feels so negative most of the time, and even when they like something, it feels like it's in spite of it being good and they're waiting for it to disappoint them again. 

I digress...

Anyway, I really would love to find someone else doing good Trek analysis that keeps up with the shows and maybe is less the ""angry nerdy white guy"" vibe that feels like it's way too common on YouTube. Any ideas? Recommendations for solid Trek analysis Youtubers/Podcasts?"
startrek,"Q might be the most entertaining character in the entire show, and EASILY some of the best acting, and yet he's barely ever utilized! In my opinion, Q is very much needed to be in the mix more often as the other members of the enterprise can become stuffy, and while they're great they rarely bring any lively, chaotic, fun whimsy to the table. They are very stoic and calculated. Q brings the perfect amount of fun to the table, and every episode he's in is a classic! I also love his character development, and the dynamics he has with the other characters!

startrek,"Just started watching season 2.

startrek,"Seriously. Lower decks and prodigy have been successful because they remember that star trek is supposed to be fun. Sure there's serious episodes/arcs in OG trek but even in those it never failed to be something fun.

Most new Trek takes itself too seriously. Most episodes alternate between scenes of people crying and awesome eye candy followed by interpersonal drama while paying lip service to the macguffin of the season. I love star trek and I watch all the shows in the hopes it'll return to the days when episodes could be less serious and characters could be irreverent. 

For the record one of my fav eps is the very serious ""in the pale moonlight"" but even that ep had some silly moments. And for every serious no fun episode there was an episode like ""trials and tribbilations"" to balance it out. 

Fingers crossed for strange new worlds. Rant over. Why isn't new trek fun?"

startrek,"First, I want to start by saying that I love the Motion Picture. I know it's fans debate if it's a good Trek film or not, but the pace, the music, the story, just fit Trek so perfectly in my humble opinion. Yes, I love the others (even 5) but TMP feels like it wasn't influenced by the action of movies like Star Wars. It fit the ""exploration"" parts of Trek so much more than other films.    

Now, this post is about tiny little thing, it's basically me nick picking, but it always bothered me when I watched the movie.  

Epsilon 9 is discussing the cloud with Enterprise, and Branch mentions the cloud is ""over 82 AUs in diameter.""  

Really? 82 AUs?  

Here's the thing: Neptune is only around 30 AUs from the sun, and Pluto is only 39 AUs away, so the cloud is more than twice the size of our Solar System? That seemed way, *way* too big. By the time the outer edges of the cloud reached earth, the center of the cloud, where Voyager 6 actually is, might be around Pluto.  

As a side note: Voyager 1 is currently 155 AUs from us.  

Today, I just had that feeling of *""I want to watch TMP,""* so I fired it up, and noticed my iTunes copy included the Director's Cut. I've seen the theatrical so many times, I wanted to see if I could notice any differences. Sure enough, Branch now says that the cloud is only 2 AUs in diameter. Seems more believable. Clearly, I wasn't the only one that thought 82 AUs was too much, if they purposefully made the change.  

What are some differences you've noticed in the director's cut from the theatrical release? ST: TMP Director's Cut fixed something that had bugged me for years."

startrek,"So with the new Robert April reveal ( I don’t really care they recasted him as I’m not sure on the canon status of the Animated Series), I was wondering if the animated series is canon or not or how much of it is. Let me know How much of the Animated Series is canon?"
startrek,"I finished watching all of Voyager several months ago and have been on DS9 for a while now, but dang. Every once in a while I suddenly remember the episode ""Drone""  and get all choked up. Yeah, I'm a sucker for plot lines involving Borg (especially Seven), but this was on a whole different level. A synopsis is ahead, but the tl;dr is that this is an awesome episode that is pretty pivotal in showcasing Seven's journey to reclaim her humanity after being rescued from the Borg.

For those who may not remember, this episode begins with Seven. She is in her quarters and standing before a small mirror. The reflection shows that she is practicing her smile, something she never did as a drone in the Borg collective. She is trying to relearn the trait when she is interrupted by The Doctor. They are a part of an away crew investigating a rapidly expanding nebula. While on the shuttle, some sort of wave erupts from the nebula, necessitating an emergency beam out.  There is a transporter malfunction (of course) that results in Seven's nanoprobes merging with The Doctor's mobile emitter following the transport.

The issue is undetected at first. They realize the emitter appears fused and is malfunctioning, but Lt. Torres thinks she can fix it easily enough. She sets it aside for repairs and during the night the device reactivates itself. It goes on to extract a tissue sample (thereby collecting DNA) from an unwitting crew member and the result is Seven's ""son"" - a Borg drone who is highly advanced (The Doctor's mobile emitter utilized tech from centuries into the future, don't forget). In the span of a single episode, the drone rapidly progresses from infancy to adulthood, and the crew - Seven, most notably - must grapple with the complexities of an anomaly like this.

Initially, they are understandably apprehensive by the presence of a Borg fetus with accelerated growth in a maturation chamber impenetrable to anyone but Seven. She has never seen the Borg reproduce in this fashion and also points out they have no way of knowing how dangerous he is...or will be. Will he try to connect with the hive? Will he summon them to Voyager's coordinates and be responsible for the assimilation of the entire crew?

Seven urges Captain Janeway to act immediately, but the latter wants to avoid unnecessary loss of life. Although Seven believes that action is warranted, Janeway points out the similarities between Seven and this new life. They are both Borg, yet simultaneously not. They are individuals who are disconnected from the collective. She encourages Seven to take responsibility for him. To raise him, teach him, and shape him. While somewhat unsure, Seven acquiesces.

When the fully grown Borg emerges from the maturation chamber, Seven - accompanied by a security team - is there. The Borg drone, later aptly named ""One,"" has the appearance of an adult male, but a childlike, inquisitive spirit. One asks numerous questions about his role and how he is supposed to function, but has no ability to comprehend Seven's nuanced responses about his individuality that contradict his basic programming.

Seeing that One simply doesn't have the capacity to understand what they are attempting to communicate to him, Seven tries to utilize a direct neural interface to provide instructions and data directly to him. In the process, he takes over the connection and begins probing Seven, hungry for all the knowledge she contains. She nearly collapses from it, but manages to speak and tells him, ""You are hurting me."" He disconnects, Seven regains her composure, and informs One he must always comply with her instructions. One hesitates and for a split second the crew is on edge as they wait for his response. After a beat, One says, ""I will comply.""

Seven begins the daunting task of instructing One, along with some assistance from Neelix and The Doctor. She is emphatic that they are individuals, not the Borg. She gives him data to download and he is overwhelmed by it. It's too much for him. She replies, ""You will adapt.""

As One matures, he develops an insatiable desire for knowledge. Seven has to set limits, not wanting him to take on too much too soon. He is eager to please and be accepted by the rest of the crew. When he meets Captain Janeway, he asks, ""Am I sufficient?"" She assures him their meeting is not for the purpose of determining his adequacy, but to get to know him. 

He is also increasingly curious about his origins and asks numerous questions about the Borg, which are deflected by Seven and the others.

One continues to grow in his capabilities and becomes an active, helpful member of the crew. When Seven takes him to engineering, he is able to calculate the rate of expansion within the nearby nebula. This endears him to Torres, as the solution to this problem had long eluded her.

Although One's appearance still intimidates some crew members, his progress is impressive and it's clear that he wants to be of service and is embracing the complexity of individuality. He even speaks in ""I"" statements instead of the ""we"" typical of Borg.

He shares quarters with Seven and regenerates in an alcove adjacent to hers. But one night, Seven's regeneration cycle is interrupted by Janeway, Tuvok, and a security team. One activated a beacon and a Borg vessel is rapidly approaching Voyager.

Seven quickly shuts down One's regeneration cycle and he steps out of the alcove. When she confronts him about the signal, he is confused and points out she disabled his transceiver as soon as he'd emerged from the maturation chamber. Upon examining him, Seven realizes that the nanoprobes in his bloodstream adapted to this and developed a secondary transceiver which sent a beacon when One shut down for his regeneration cycle.

The Voyager crew spring into action. They have almost no chance against a Borg vessel, but they are going to do everything possible to stay alive…and keep One safe too. If the Borg were to get ahold of his advanced, 29th century technology there would not only be no hope for them. All of humanity would be doomed.

Janeway decides it's time One had his questions answered about his Borg history. She and Seven show him footage of The Federation's previous encounters with the Borg and the destruction that followed. Janeway reiterates that the crew do not want to be assimilated, as it would kill their distinctiveness. They would no longer be unique individuals. They would be drones. One doesn't seem sure how to respond to this. Moments later, when in a turbolift with Seven, he asks, ""You do not wish to rejoin the collective?""

""Voyager is my collective,"" she replies.

When the two of them disembark and step onto the bridge, it's obvious that there is a substantial amount of tension and fear. There's a red alert and the Borg have hailed Voyager. Janeway opens a channel and their message comes through. They will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Prepare to be boarded.

Both One and Seven appear to be almost hypnotized by the call of the Borg. One informs Seven he can hear them calling to him and she admits she can hear it too.

""Billions of voices speaking as one,"" she murmurs, a dazed expression on her face.

Janeway exchanges a look of concern with Chakotay, but at that moment Seven turns to One and tells him they must resist that voice or Voyager will be destroyed. She provides him with a station where he can access the shields and use his own advanced tech to supplement them, but One appears to have already formulated a plan.

His expression, once marked by innocence and curiosity, now appears grim and aged. Having accumulated the knowledge of Seven and every drone before her, having seen the devastation the Borg have wrought with his own eyes, and having heard the personal pleas of Janeway and Seven, he now understands what he must do.

He takes control of the bridge, connects his own interface with Voyager's, remodulates the shields, and provides enchantments to weapons systems as he gives orders to the distressed crew members on the bridge. He possesses the composure and competence of an experienced senior officer and the crew that once feared him now respond to his every command with relief and confidence.

He then explains that he will need to board the Borg vessel so he can sabotage its systems and destroy it. Seven reminds One the Borg will attempt to assimilate him. He gives her a slight smile and answers, ""They will fail.""

Janeway instructs Harry Kim to get a lock onto him, but One explains that is not necessary. He then activates his personal transport and beams himself onto the opposing ship. Once aboard, One announces to the Borg that they have no chance against his technological superiority and to immediately end their attack on Voyager or he will destroy them. The Borg ignore him and restate their intentions to assimilate him and the Voyager crew. Seeing they do not intend to retreat, One turns and heads towards an alcove. He is intercepted by multiple drones, but they are no match for him. He succeeds in reaching the alcove where he is able to disrupt their navigational controls and steer them into the nearby nebula.

Seven watches helplessly from the bridge on Voyager as the Borg vessel's hull collapses in on itself while inside the nebula. Everything indicates that One perished along with the Borg and she appears devastated, but as Janeway is in the process of dispatching repair crews to the damaged decks, One's life signal is detected amidst the wreckage. He has erected a force field around himself and has survived.

One is transported directly to sickbay and Seven rushes to his side. The Doctor is already preparing for surgery and explains that One's technical components are already rapidly repairing themselves, but his human body is failing and they must prepare to operate immediately.

In a raspy voice, One tells Seven he was never meant to be. He is only a random convergence of technologies.

""You are unique,"" protests Seven.

But One tells Seven that as long as he exists, she is in danger. All of Voyager is in danger. The Borg are now aware of him. They will try to find him.

""They will fail,"" she assures him.

The Doctor intervenes and informs them their conversation will have to wait so that he can operate. When he attempts to sedate One, he is deflected by a force field.

Seven steps in and orders One to allow The Doctor to proceed. When he doesn't respond, Seven insists he must comply. He only looks at her and she repeats, her voice now trembling, ""You must comply.""

But she has raised an individual. Not a drone. And he declares emphatically, ""I will not.""

Seven's voice breaks as she pleads, ""Please. You are hurting me.""

His synapses are failing and alarms chirp in the background. With his final breath, he speaks his last words. Words that are an echo of what Seven told him whenever he was overwhelmed or could not fully understand something yet.

""You will adapt.""

One's death reveals a part of Seven's humanity that she had yet to reawaken: grief. In the final scene, Seven stands before the mirror in her quarters. But she is not practicing her smile and instead, the mirror reflects a tear on her cheek.

""Drone"" is a new favorite episode of mine. Props to J. Paul Boehmer for his portrayal of One as well. Boehmer has portrayed multiple characters throughout various episodes across the Star Trek franchise and has fantastic chemistry with the rest of the Voyager cast, but this was a particularly strong performance for him. He exhibited incredible range in his depiction of One, a complicated character with significant development throughout the entirety of the episode. Boehmer nailed everything from One's early delight and bewilderment at the world around him to his eventual transformation into a somber leader on the bridge who ultimately chooses to die in order to save Seven and his fellow crew members.

This is also a notable episode in developing Seven's storyline further. It builds on the intricacies of her character previously established a couple episodes prior, during which she chose to sacrifice herself rather than risk the deaths of a handful of crew members in stasis. It was a significant moment in the series and arguably one that foreshadowed the decision made later by One (and if you doubt me, I'd like to add that the episode was titled ""One,"" which I don't think was a coincidence).

The culmination is a fuller, richer portrait of Seven and her character. Yes, she is stunning, intelligent, and capable. As much as I appreciate those qualities, they aren't what make her most intriguing as a character and they aren't what draw me to her.

Seven, I think, understands and embodies sacrifice more than any other character from the series. She knows what it means to suffer and to endure. She is seemingly built for it and only comes out stronger. True to the words of the Borg, she always adapts. Not only does she adapt, she thrives. Even her grief is put to good use; it seems to open a door to a tender, more expressive Seven who discovers she possesses remarkable musical talent, a passion for the culinary arts, and more. It prepares her for her interactions with Icheb and the other children Voyager rescues from the disabled Borg vessel in season six. Most significantly, Seven is a symbol of hope to those who have experienced tremendous loss. Certainly to her fictional counterparts, but I find her inspiring and won't discount the possibility of the character's potential to touch other viewers as well.

For all the somewhat expected campiness of Star Trek (especially Trek episodes from the 90s or earlier), this one has aged surprisingly well. Months later and I'm still reeling from the emotional gut punch from Voyager's ""Drone"""
startrek,"I was reading about religious types who have built perfect replicas of Noah's Ark, has anyone every considered building a replica of the Enterprise? I'm sure every Trek fan would pay to visit it? Has anyone ever proposed making a full sized Enterprise as a tourist attraction?"
startrek,"I'm downsizing my Star Trek collection and I want to make sure it goes to folks who will truly love it and appreciate it like I have. 

I haven't really been actively collecting in years since eBay was in its prime and I don't know where to go with it. I know eBay is the obvious choice but not sure if its still good option for Star Trek collectables. 

I'm curious, are there groups anywhere else like FB or similar I should look into? It's mainly rare books and action figures from the TNG/DS9/VOY years. 

My friend collects Transformers stuff and he's always telling me about Transformer trading forums and groups. I figured there may be Trek or Sci-Fi ones that I don't know about.

Thanks in advance for the help! Selling Trek memorabilia?"
startrek,Just gotta avoid SNW spoilers for the next month or so!! Paramount Plus launches in June in the UK!
startrek,It is left ambiguous in the episode with Picard's diplomatic evasion of the ambassador's question about how we was able to resist her. Do you think Captain Picard gave into temptation and slept with Kamala in The Perfect Mate?
startrek,"OK so it's been accepted that because Q changed the timeline and the Confederation rose, Picard never went back in time to meet Guinan.  I personally think that's dumb, but lets follow that thread.  

So now Picard and team are going to restore the timeline and the Federation. That should mean that in the future PIcard does go back and meet Guinan, which means the original timeline will be completely restored and wipe out everything happening in S2 Picard.  Because, at a minimum, if he meets Guinan earlier than everything we are seeing once he finds her in 2024 will have changed.  At a maximum, this season never happened.  And if it didn't happen then Jurati can't be the Borg queen in the future!

The writers really thought they were being clever, but they are only applying their own rule to half of the story.  They didn't follow it all the way through and realize that their changes would also be erased with the restoration of the timeline! One more post about the dumb timeline"

startrek,"What things do you remember from Star Trek that you felt were left unanswered or should have had a second look at?

&amp;#x200B;

For me the nanite planet where they left those nanites from TNG ""Evolution"" would love to know what they evolved into.

Also what became of the exocomps?  I know Lower Decks has one in the crew but I am referencing only the live action Trek universe.   I wonder how they also evolved post TNG. What are your unanswered Star Trek questions?"
startrek,"Rewatched the season opener before we get to the finale, as it should bring everything full circle back to the Stargazer, and I gotta say IMO it's actually better the second time around when you know how things play out.

While I can agree that the whole 2024 LA storyline has been very much a drag, I've still overall enjoyed this season, mainly cause I've actually enjoyed the whole Jurati and the Queen arc.

I'd say out of this season I'll definitely be able to rewatch the first 2 episodes and the final 2 episodes again and enjoy them.(assuming the finale sticks it's Q landing) Picard season 2 rewatchability"
startrek,"Before streaming services and expectation of the viewer maybe having a tivo in the Temporal Cold War during the UPN days of Enterprise, episodes had to have the conflict resolved in 1 or sometimes 2 episodes. Taking a whole season to resolve a conflict doesn't feel utopian to me and if it doesn't feel utopian is it really utopian? Can Star Trek still be utopian and have the conflict resolution take more than 1 episode/movie?"
startrek,I remember watching Star Trek II as an 10yr old kid and being absolutely blown away! I’m a now a 45yr old fan and love my Star Trek. What made you a Star Trek fan?
startrek,It makes me so happy when characters from different series show up. Troi and Barclay on Voyager. Or seeing Bashir on TNG. I’m finally finishing Enterprise and it’s great to see Riker pop up again. I love seeing characters from different series
startrek,"Hi, trekkies 🖖 So as the title says, I want to watch Enterprise but know little-to-nothing of ST. I’m a huge Scott Bakula fan after watching Quantum Leap and really fell in love with his character, so I want to see more of his work. I’m hoping Enterprise is standalone, in the sense that it could be considered a basic sci-fi show that someone could jump into without watching the shows that were released before it.

I’ll also note that I have watched a few episodes of the OG show and Next Generation and quite enjoyed what I saw. I just don’t have the time to do a deep dive into ST.  

Anyway, let me know! Do I need any prior Trekky knowledge to watch Enterprise?"
startrek,I don't have an in depth analysis on this or anything. I just wanted to say that Seven describing how Janeway went to bat for her RE: applying to Starfleet was a great bit of lore. It really scratched an itch and I think I need a Voyager follow up show now. Picard S2E9 - Seven's history with Starfleet
startrek,"In Voyager, the episode Jetrel.  They almost save a Talaxian.  Do they ever mention again if it ever works?   I assume voyager gave the Talaxians all the info they'd need to rescue them.  Just need a bigger transporter. Did they figure out how to rescue Rinax?"
startrek,"So I got convinced into starting start trek this year and so far it has been kinda fun but I'm worried about the show being like this for so many series and seasons.

I'm usually not so much into shows that have one isolated case every episode without advancing to an endgame. I get it if it is just the first season or maybe the first series.

My question is, do the individual episodes contribute in any way to a major plot in the future seasons or series? Or are they always treated as isolated scenarios with no connection to any other episode and or to a main goal? Currently at S01E17 TOS, will the next series have continuity?"

startrek,"Just finished S3:E7 and I cannot fathom how much crap the crew has taken from the Cardassians with no consequence.

startrek,"So I watch Next Gen, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise all the way through once every year. I have them on mostly as background noise, and Next Gen is definitely my ""zone out before I sleep"" show for when I need a little something. 

Until I accidentally get interested in an episode I've seen a dozen times lol

Last week - I forget which one - I came across a scene in TNG where they're discussing Earth's World War III. And y'all...according to that timeline it started in 2026 and lasted for thirty years.

It's now 2022. 

My brain's on overdrive right now looking for comparisons. Just...crazy. I pointed it out to my mom the other day and she called Roddenberry a ""prophet."" I wouldn't go that far, but of course the ""prophet"" reference made me giggle and think of DS9.

Anyway...those are my Trekkie musings for the week! One funny and one...not so funny... oO A Crazy Realization During My Next Gen Rewatch"
startrek,"I had a thought today. What if instead of de-aging Brent Spiner / Data, Picard had dreamt of Data as an older version of himself (since it was a dream sequence, there's no Canon reason why Data had to look exactly like Data). 

It could have been worked into the plot... Picard regrets that Data never got to be an ""old man"". Or that time is slipping away. And avoided some kind of imperfect deep fake action. 

How would you have felt about it? Would you have liked it better... (S1 Picard)"
startrek,"Has someone swapped out  Picard and some of the other crew members with less competent a-holes?

They seem to act completely out of character.

First the space baby. They kill it's mother and when it tries to feed from the ship, they try to shake it off and get out. They don't show any compassion at all and don't even try to make sure it's gonna be ok and can survive without a mother. Basically it's someone else's problem now, bye!

Then the dr. Timicin episode. Picard basically says not my problem, let them murder him and other  60 year olds. He clearly doesn't want to die and isn't ok with it. This seems clearly out of character for Picard because they always have interfered before and at least tried to negotiate change or searched the laws to find a way out, like say they didn't just leave Wesley to die after he broke the glass thing. This seemed really dark and messed up.

Amd finally, the last episode where Worf and the new Klingon emperor asked for help. Not helping seemed like strategically absolutely idiotic choice, risking your ally to fall to rebellion who would then turn them over to your enemy. Nor does it seem to contradict with any federation directives I know of. The emperor was lawfully elected and those who opposed them were basically just terrorists at that point since they ignored the local laws plus their ally and the legally elected leader asked for aid. 

Oh right and Picard would have let Worf die in that episode. Picard of s1-3 would never have made that choice and would have done everything to get him out.. like put the Enterprise between the line of fire or at least tried to beam him out. Just finished watching TNG season 4 and I'm confused.."
startrek,"Hi everyone.  Not much notice on this, but tomorrow afternoon my friend and I will be conducting an oral history interview via Zoom with William Sargent who played Dr. Thom Leighton in TOS The Conscience of the King.  These are the questions we are planning to ask him.  Anyone got anything the REALLY want to know about the making of this episode ?

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Lets start with your early biography.  You were born in 1930 under the name Wolf Jacobowicz and you and your family emigrated to Palestine in 1933 and you grew up under the British Mandate of Palestine.  Can you tell us a bit about your family and your early life ?

2)	You emigrated to the United States in 1947 and you were drafted to fight in Korea as an American soldier in 1951 can you tell us about this part of your life ?

3)	After Korea in 1953 you would have been 23 years old and you used the GI Bill to study at the Neighbourhood Playhouse in New York.  Can you talk to us about the transition from soldier to actor ?

4)	You studied theatre from 1953 to 1955 can you tell us any stories about learning your craft ?

5)	In the 1950s you changed your name from Wolf Jacobowicz to William Sergant.  Where did this name come from ?

6)	You started acting professionally in the mid 1950s do you have any stories about your early theatre career ?

7)	In 1960 you moved to Hollywood.  Your first imdb credit is for a legal drama called “the law and mrs jones” where you played a doctor.  Do you have any stories about how you got the part and how you transition from acting on stage to acting in front of a camera ?

8)	In 1962 Richard Basehart played Adolf Hitler in a movie.  You were cast as Court von Stauffenberg, a man who infamously failed in his attempt to assassinate Hitler.  As a German born jewish man who grew up during the war how did you prepare for this role ?

9)	In the early to mid 1960s you did a number of guest appearances in American television, but you made multiple different appearances on Dr. Kildare.  Why did they keep asking you back?

10)	So in 1966 you were cast in the 13th episode of Star Trek called “The Conscience of the King”.  Do you remember much about the casting process or the production ?

11)	In your Star Trek episode Arnold Moss plays Karidian a planetary governor who commits genocide and only a handful of people including you and Captain Kirk can identify him.  Karidian seems to be a space-age stand in for some of the infamous nazis like Eichmann and Dr. Mengele.  I’m wondering if this is something we are reading into, or if the performers with aware of it at the time and if it influenced the performances?

12)	Obviously you shot your scenes and moved onto the next job, and of course Star Trek was cancelled a few years later.  When did you first realize that this show was having a second life in syndication?

13)	According to production records you did two days of work on this episode on September 13th and September 15th 1966.  How does it feel for two days of work to follow you for 50 years?  Has it been a blessing or a curse?

14)	You had roles in a number of popular shows in the 1960s like Mission Impossible, The Twlight Zone and Peyton place, do you have any stories about this time in your life? 

15)	In the 1970s and 1980s you continued acting in television, and did a lot of theatrical work.  Do you have any stories about this period of your life?

16)	In 1987 you and your wife relocated to Salt Lake City and you ran a theatre.  What prompted the move to Salt Lake ?

17)	Your Theatre in Sale Lake lasted for 4 seasons, do you have any highlights from this point in your life?

18)	What kind of difficulties did you encounter operating a theatre in Utah ?

19)	Getting back to Star Trek, have you ever attended a Star Trek convention  If yes, do you have any stories  If no, why not?

20)	You have been very receptive to receiving fan mail and autograph requests at your home.  Do you have any stories about interesting letters you’ve received or strange items people have asked you to autograph ?

21)	 In your career, what was your favoritiure performance or production and left favorite performance prodution

22)	You spent decades working in Hollywood and American theatre.  Was there ever anyone you met or worked with where you became starstruck ?

23)	You’ve been retired for a number of years.  Do you miss it?

24)	You are now 91 years old, looking back on your life, what would your message be for the younger generations?

25)	I suspect its going to be mostly Star Trek fans listening to this, what would you say to the Trekkies who are listening to this ? I am doing an oral history interview with a TOS guest star tomorrow, what do you all think of these questions"
startrek,"What is the best trek series and why is it DS9? 

I’ll wait. Best trek"
startrek,"I’m currently watching the first to last episode of DS9 (the one before the finale). Kira has been in a starfleet uniform for a couple episodes now I believe. I thought it was just for show to make Damar and the other Cardassians for willing to work with her since she’s Bajoran. 

But I’m question myself and think that the Admiral actually make her a Starfleet Commander. 

Which is correct? Kira and Starfleet"

startrek,"Kore (Soong’s genetically augmented daughter) = retconned Kahn.

I know Kahn was from the 20th century but the 21st isn’t all too far off. She’s a genetically augmented human. She might be superior, guess we don’t know if Q’s antidote had any additional beneficial effects. Her name has 4 letters and starts with K.

Just something that came to mind today that I hope I’m wrong with.

startrek,"As I continue to struggle to find new shows I actually like I find myself wishing I could watch a lot of shows for the first time again. No knowledge about them just a whole fresh start. Voyager in particular is the Star Trek I wish for the most because when I started watching it I just fell in love with the idea of them being lost in a different quadrant. 

When I first started watching Star Trek in like the 10th grade probably 6 some years ago I looked up the air dates of the shows and watched them in order. 

So first I watched TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, Discovery had a few seasons by the time I made it that far. I fell in love with TOS, I stayed because of TNG, DS9 made me interested in the other quadrants, but Voyager was an entire show in a different quadrant. And I loved it to death. Still do but there are a lot of episodes that I kind of just don’t like anymore after seeing the show like 20 times. DS9 is definitely my favorite for Story Telling, and TNG for episodic. Voyager is not my favorite there are a lot of issues in the story and things that just done make since. But when you are watching it for the first time do you really thinking about it that deeply? I certainly didn’t but I was younger than haha. 

What Star Treks do you wish you could watch again for the first time? Or just shows in general and why? I wish I could watch Voyager for the first time again. What Trek do you wish?"
startrek,"I feel like this is a massive oversight on paramounts side. With how controversial (and imo just plain bad) season 2 of Picard is, and the nostalgia of TNG, it would definitely be the right move at this point.

I know that TNG ended with a beautiful episode and I wouldn’t want to disturb that legacy, but I also love Trek and want to see it succeed as both a story and a brand (so we can get more Trek!)

Opinions? Thoughts? Petitions? Paramount would get more viewers if they retitled Picard: S3 to TNG: S8"

startrek,"I highly doubt there's anything canon for the explanation, but I had a thought while watching one of my favorite episodes, Voy S2E1 ""The Thirty Sevens"". While under fire from the native humans of the planet, Chakotay asks Belana if she can provide any cover fire.

I'd assume they were at relatively the same ground altitude as Voyager, so that brings up the question. Can phasers be fired with a ballistic arc? In this scenario, it would either have to be that or torpedos. Torps would probably kill everyone in the area tho.

TL;DR can phasers be fired with a ballistic arc? Similar to modern artillery. Question about phasers."
startrek,"In ""Distant voices"" DS9S3E18 Bashir is trapped inside his own mind and he is aware that the people he talks to different representations of himself. Still, he does not talk to anyone about being genetically engineered. It would make sense to talk about when hes lost tennis career and him being second in his class.

So is he lying to himself or did the writers just not know yet? Is Dr. Bashir lying to himself or did the writers just not know he was genetically engineered?"
startrek,I recently rewatched Star Trek: Beyond and it got me thinking about something: did the Kelvinverse Enterprise get a glimpse of what things where like before Nero and Prime Spock changed things; were they using a ship from that original timeline? Why does the Star Trek universe have to be so damn confusing?
startrek,"Greetings, fellow redditors! 

While many of you may have discovered the series by watching TNG/DS9/VOY, or maybe even the original series, my first contact with the franchise watching Star Trek: Discovery.

I watched DISCO's first season without knowing anything about the franchise. Therefore, I didn't have any expectations on what a ST series should be. While I liked it, there are some aspects of the series I felt were wasted. 

While I'd later learned that DISCO's Klingons were supposed to represent racist americans, my first impression was that they were a analogy to anti-USA/anti-imperialist and nationalist factions in the modern world, like pan-arabism and Islamic fundamentalism. I think my perception actually fits them better: contrary to US far-right movements, who inhabit what's one of the most prosperous countries in the world and fear ""contamination"" from people who came from poorer countries, the Klingons are a divided and relatively weak (compared to their foes) people fighting a prosperous superpower they perceive as imperialist. Many people outside the US have a very similar view: that the culture of the mighty USA is destroying their own due to its influence. T'kuvma himself is a representation of it: he is extremely xenophobic towards alien (by ""alien"" I mean non-klingon) races, but is actually progressive when it comes to other Klingons, accepting outcasts like Voq and promoting unity among his people.

(A situation which could serve as a better analogy for USA's racist problem would be intolerance against romulan immigrants after the supernova, for example).

Because of this impression, since the first episode I thought we'd get a nuanced portrayal of the conflict and the enemies. The klingon side wouldn't be shown as fundamentally good, but we'd get to understand their motivations and even sympathize with them a little. Voq could represent the best aspects of this klingon neo-nationalist movement (end of fights and intolerance between Klingons), while others could represent the worst. Maybe we could see that the Federation, while not exactly evil, has been failing to adequately interact with the Klingons and to understand how much they've been affecting them. 

I was quite disappointed by the rest of the season. We didn't get to explore the Klingons and their ideology that much, specially after Voq's ""disappearance"". T'kuvma and Voq, two characters which I found extremely interesting, died quickly (or, in Voq's case, were completely changed). On the Federation's side, the imperfect, morally grey captain was revealed to be a mustach twirling villain. The way they ended the war was also quite unsatisfying. I couldn't help but feel the series' themes could have been better explored...

Now, years after my first watch, my opinion hasn't changed that much. I was extremely satisfied when I watched Deep Space 9, because,  in many ways, it was much closer to my expectations towards Discovery: lots of nuance, complex villains, etc. The Cardassian Union is not portrayed as good, but we can understand how they became such a authoritarian civilization and feel some sympathy for some cardassian characters. 

So, what do you think? Star Trek Discovery's Klingons: missed potential?"
startrek,"I started watching Star Trek because I really wanted to watch TNG. I thought it would be a good idea to watch at least the first season of TOS before moving into TNG just so that I have a basic understanding of the lore and so that I could appreciate the changes and advancements made between the two series. Is there a movie or specific episodes of TOS that I should also definitely watch before starting TNG? I’ve watched the first season of TOS and the first movie, is there anything that I should definitely watch before stating TNG?"
startrek,"I love this ship almost as much as Kirk does. Please SNW, Show Exteriors of NC-1701 frequently and Treat Her well!"
startrek,"I know there's an episode to go and it might become clear but have I already missed why he's involved this season?

Ok episode 1 they all die and wake up in the alternate universe. Presumably Q did that but why? Does he want the launch to go ahead - as part of the medical team can't he just declare her unfit to travel? He's dying - or moving to a new plane of existence? I guess I just can't figure out what his deal is. It doesn't appear to be a test like before so what's going on? Have I missed what Q's motivation is this season?"
startrek,"Discovery is the worst Star Trek series I've ever watched. And this may be an unpopular opinion but there is no way it can be cannon. From the tardis like space of the turbo lifts to the fact Food Replicators didn't exist yet its like they just threw everything out the window and tried to create a rip off. 

The Necels are attached by space magic now? Its saddening. un popular opinion: Discovery is not cannon"
startrek,"It’s just one small moment but it really shows the connections in the Trek universe and how intimate Vulcan is with Earth. I mean they’ve studied Earth for hundreds of years.

On my first viewing I actually wrote it off as an older Spock using humor. (Star Trek IV) I love that the phrase “only Nixon can go to China” is an old Vulcan Proverb"
startrek,"I feel like I’m not seeing enough people realising this. They have NOTHING for these characters to do. Raffi and Seven have been running around aimlessly for most of the season, they sidelined Elnor, not even trying to give him something to do. That is, until he is a hologram (great). Picard has just been having some feelings while they reuse the same damn footage over, and over, and over, and over again. In I guess what they assumed would be some mind blowing reveal. Instead it’s been a slow and excruciating reveal (certainly not in a good way)

It is interminable. Utterly interminable. What does this have to do with Q!? Why are these Borg so completely useless? I’m reluctant to even call them the Borg. These writers are awful. The ‘story’ is somehow both bloated and empty at the same time. If it wasn’t for the many call backs and references I’d be convinced the writers haven’t even watched Star Trek.

I want to like this show, I really do. But I genuinely could not care less about a single one of these characters or this story. I’m so worried about next season now. Please don’t ruin the whole bunch of the TNG characters. This season of Picard is absolutely appalling"

startrek,"I know that the universal translator enables different races to talk to each other, but is there a canon explanation to how species can communicate without them, it doesn’t seem a very good reason and i wish they decided on a different one because there are so many situations where it wouldn’t work, for example a star ship with all power cut, according to the lore about the universal translator, all the different species would be babbling to each other but this doesn’t happen How does language work?"
startrek,"As a life-long Trek fan, I was quite dismayed and saddened to see the LGBT colors on the logo here.

Is this a community about Star Trek, or a community about liberal political activism? Or both?

Is the purpose of the flag to create a sense of hostility and intolerance toward those who don't share the many controversial political and social views promoted by the LGBT movement?

Is this an intolerant community where Star Trek fans are unwelcome (or made to feel unwelcome) unless they happen to subscribe to all the ideas and moral values promoted by the LGBT movement?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the Star Trek franchise always promoted human goodness, inclusion, peace, tolerance and other such virtues?

How then can it be appropriate to display the banner of a highly divisive modern political movement which rails against the moral, social, and religious values of most of the world today and all human history. Not to mention it going against the views of most historical fans and producers of Star Trek, including Gene himself, who certainly did not hold to all of the extremist views espoused by the modern LGBT movement, and in any case isn't here to either agree nor disagree with them.

To me, displaying the 'pride' banner here seems like a shameless hijacking of a beloved TV franchise in order to promote minority values that have nothing to do with the show or the personal beliefs of most of its fanbase.

Does this community hold a policy of discrimination and intolerance toward those who are different and hold different political, social, or moral personal views? Or are all people welcome here, even if we strongly disagree with the claims made by the LGBT movement? Why does the logo use LGBT / 'pride' colors?"
startrek,"This is probably not very smart to post, but I feel like I need to say it.

Earlier, I was looking through comments on an ad for *Strange New Worlds*, and at least a third of the comments were just hating on it and new Trek in general, most of those hate comments specifically hating it for being “woke” (it is important to note that *Strange New Worlds* isn’t even out yet. We have very little idea what it’s characters or content will be like).

Star Trek has always been woke! From a black woman on the bridge in TOS, to an interracial kiss in TOS, to an episode about gender identity in TNG, to a lesbian kiss in DS9, and probably a hundred other things I’m not thinking of.

And even if Star Trek wasn’t always that progressive, what’s the problem with it being so now? So Discovery has a black woman lead, 4 gay characters, a non-binary character, and a trans character. That’s great! People like to see themselves represented in media, and there’s a lot more to the world than straight, white, men. Why do so many people hate on Star Trek for being “woke”?"

startrek,"This week we had Picard remembering a repressed childhood memory. Over in the MCU we also had Marc Spectre, aka Moon Knight, discovering a repressed childhood memory. Yet, there is a big difference in terms of presentation between both shows.

Moon Knight dedicated an entire episode solely to revealing Marc Spectre's childhood. I won't reveal anymore spoilers other than to say that the episode riveting and gut wrenching to watch. Marc's breakthrough at the end was painful and sad. It felt earned. His childhood trauma felt believable. How it lead to his current state as an adult was believable.

In contrast, the revelation of Picard's mother was a wafer thin B-story woven in between fights with Borg. It was almost like an afterthought. Clearly, action is more important than character development. It really showed how much importance the writers gave to Yvette Picard's suicide - It lacked any impact.

I am asked to believe that Picard, the man who proudly asserted to Q that humanity's goal is to constantly improve one's self and that the final frontier is within ourselves, is also the man who refused to look inside himself for most his life. Picard buried this secret so deeply, even Deanna and Lwaxana could not see it. It even impacted Picard's love life, making him unwilling to commit to Laris. Yet, in an alternate future timeline Picard was married to Beverly. I am afraid I do not see the connection here. How does Picard thinking he caused his mother's suicide lead to him not willing to commit to a relationship? As a result of these issues, I just cannot believe what the writers are asking me to believe about Picard. I have to say Marvel did a better job this week... [Spoilers for Picard]"

startrek,"Part of what I love about the star trek universe is the ability of the Federation to accept Klingons/Ferengi’s/etc, etc.

As a community I think we should be equally as accepting of alternative formats of the shows. I love the traditional TNG/TOS/DS9 procedural stuff. At the same time they can get a bit monotonous (literally everyone knows this ). So Picard and Discovery elaborating on a story that the aforementioned procedurals would have dedicated an episode or two for the same story while cutting a myriad of details out shouldn’t be looked down on. 

Stop hating on Discovery and Picard. In case you haven’t noticed shows nowadays are going for 10-12 episode seasons because streaming is a thing whether ppl like it or not and 25 episode seasons are hard to binge. I’m hopeful for strange new worlds because that might give the procedural storyline that I like, but stop crapping on discovery or Picard because they don’t fit the “mold” you are used to. You’ll be left behind Stop the hate on Discovery/ Picard"

startrek,"Hey. Middle-aged Trek fan here that wasn't a Trek fan his entire life but has been for a few years over a decade now. DS9 is my flagship.

I recently finished TNG. It took me nearly four years to watch it. I never felt connected to it nor did I ever feel the urge to keep watching it. Sure, there were some good and great episodes, but it all felt so dated and the majority of the episodes were not good or great in my opinion. It's a hot take, I understand that, and people will be upset by it, lol. That's okay. I have seen most of TOS and I've seen all Star Trek films. Love em. And I love the TNG characters too. But the stories just never grabbed me. Idk, that's all I know. I only finally finished it b/c it was going off Netflix so it gave me an excuse to blast through it conveniently.

I never got around to Voyager. I've watched Enterprise. I even like most of what the new modern Trek shows have to offer (gasp, downvotes incoming! lol). I always was under the impression that Voyager was the weaker sibling to TNG/DS9. The redheaded stepchild. I never took the plunge until now.

HO-LEE SHIT YA'LL!!! Voyager is AWESOME. ""Caretaker"" is literally one of the best Star Trek tv episodes ever and the crew is fun! It's funny to me b/c compared to the other crews they're kinda boring! But they have great dynamics and play well off each other and everyone’s laughing and riding and cornholing. Now there are indeed some minor stinker eps in the mix, but even those are fun to me b/c I just end up rifftraxing them with myself, lmao. I did watch one recently in S5 that was just all around bad though. 5x05 ""Once Upon A Time"". Zzzzzzzz. Anyway, my point is that it doesn't feel like a chore for me to sit through a bad episode of Voyager like it did with TNG. 

Also! I love the fact that the interior of the ship looks like a starship and not an 80's luxury hotel, haha.

I didn't mean for this to be a TNG hate fest I promise! Voyager is just so much more exciting for me and it's a shame I waited so long to find out for myself but then again I am having a blast RIGHT NOW watching it. At least it's finally happening! I've blazed through 4 1/2 seasons in just a couple of weeks.

Jeri Ryan came on in S4 and upstages everyone. So fucking talented, jesus christ.

TL,DR I fucking LOVE Voyager!

DS9 still holds my heart. 

🖖 TL,DR I freaking LOVE Voyager."

startrek,"I have a theory about the structure of narratives in the different eras of Star Trek that I think helps explain some of why reactions to the newest era of shows has been so contentious. (I think this applies to new Dr. Who, too, but that's a whole different subreddit.)

In the first era of Trek (TOS, TAS), narratives are more akin to histories. TOS was written in the golden age of social science fiction. The complexity we see in the narrative is meant to help us understand these societies and the people in them. For example, in 'Balance of Terror', we learn about the Federation-Romulan War and the Vulcan-Romulan connection in order for us to understand the motivations of the various characters, what their societies value, etc.

In the second era of Trek (TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT), narratives are psychological dramas. The complexities of the narratives are meant to help us understand the people in these situations. It's still social science fiction, but we're trying to understand the individual people. Worf isn't just a Klingon, he's a Klingon who spent a lot of time disconnected from a culture he's not really sure he can claim any more. Kira is trying to figure out how to live in a complicated world after growing up (and being comfortable) in a morally black-and-white world. Janeway struggles to hold on to values that were at the bedrock of her identity until she was so far away from home that it wasn't clear they really work any more.

Between the second and third eras for Trek, television writers maxed out the complexity that a narrative can have that still works like a narrative. Lost, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc. They had huge casts and complex stories. Writers and producers in the second era of Trek were operating under the assumption that audiences wouldn't accept that, but the success of Lost showed that we would. But, by the time that Trek creators were ready to start on the third era, that complexity had been taken as far as anyone would accept.

In the third era of Trek (DSC, PIC), narratives are vehicles for emotional catharsis. The complexity of the narrative isn't meant to stand up to the kind of scrutiny that second era plots were. The Burn and  The DMA and whatever Q is up to aren't meant to be examined the way that we could rationalize the politics of the Romulan Senate or the great houses of the Klingon Empire. They're a backdrop that lets us experience Su'Kal's grief and Book's loneliness and Michael's anger and Stammet's desperation and Adira's longing. It's why PIC stops the action for Picard himself to remember the trauma of his childhood, so we can experience his regret. 

I find Picard's emotional journey through PIC really compelling, especially his feelings of regret about a life that very few people around him would criticize. I can easily see, however, how a person in a different place in their life would find absolutely nothing resonant about it, and they'd be left holding the strange pieces of the plot and wondering what in the world is going on.

Similarly, there are parts of DSC that hit me really hard. I've had emotions that felt like they could've shaken the universe. (Fortunately, I'm not a Kelpian who grew up on a massive dilithium deposit. It makes sense to me, though, that if that emotional catharsis doesn't work for you, you'd wonder what all the fuss of a complicated plot was for if all it lead to was emotional catharsis.

(Side note: The Flux in the latest season of Dr. Who is very much akin to The Burn and The DMA. If the emotional journey of The Doctor doesn't resonate with you, you'd be justified in asking what the point of all the running around is for when the answers are so sparse. I don't think we're really supposed to understand. We're supposed to feel the same confusion and desperation The Doctor feels for the world ending that I feel when I watch the news.)

TL;DR: The complicated plots in DSC and PIC don't make sense because they aren't supposed to. They're scaffolding to get us to the point where we can experience an emotional catharsis with the characters. A theory about narratives and the eras of Star Trek"

startrek,"I love the wild west, the idea of exploring a land for the first time. The unknown. It hasnt been mapped, or civilized. You dont know what you'll find. 
Star trek is the wild west on a much more massive scale. Each and every planet has a planet's worth of mysteries to solve and unlock.
The idea of one little small island on some random planet (or moon) or asteroid even, and there is some long lost runaway genius holding up there. He uses technology to the utmost affect for his desires. He has a small horde of animals; pigs cows etc, so he can eat how he likes. 
A garden with *every* spice and vegetable/fruit in the galaxy. 
And then he's hidden inside some dispersion zone which blocks sensors etc. 
On just one planet, there are so many possible mysteries to discover. In star trek, there are infinite planets. 
You're venturing into the unknown. 
The idea of a completely new, wholly un-explored planet, and *everything* that implies.

I also like the command structure of a star ship, and the approach they take to tackle problems in a logical, professional way.

I commend them for trying to keep a new show on just about every week year-round, but I'm not thrilled with the idea that every show needs ten episodes every season: no more and no less.

Different stories benefit from different amounts of space. A heavily serialized story with everything revolving around a single main plot benefits from a tighter focus with a shorter episode count, while a more episodic show with different paths to explore throughout the season would benefit from having more episodes to stretch its wings.

I really think the production teams should have the freedom to explore different length seasons based on what works best for the show, and/or the story Why I think 10-episode seasons for everything is a mistake"

startrek,"Inspired by a comment on r/deepspacenine, I started thinking about the variety of ""sentient"" Holo characters across all the star trek series. 

First there's Moriarty in TNG who sets of whole discussions of morality and sentience and the complexity there. 

Then there's Vic Fontaine in DS9 who is ""sentient"" and knows he's a holodeck character. He also meddles in things outside the holodeck (like accessing personnel files and calling Odos office from the holodeck), but there isn't the same discussion of sentience here. It's just accepted that this is what it is. 

Then we have the Doctor on Voyager, who starts to challenge questions about AI purpose and rights and citizenship. 

So- how do all these holodeck characters fit together? How do you perceive each of them and our main characters reactions to their sentience? Are they all truly sentient?

I understand that Picard and Crew travelled back from the divergent confederation timeline, but as that split hasn’t happened yet in the time they travelled too, shouldn’t Guinan technically recall At least a version of Picard?

Hart to Hart is a totally silly and fun show from the 80s that my wife and I are binging right now.  They always have a ton of guest stars, but I wasn't expecting this!  No small role in this episode, either. Watching Hart to Hart (S3E14) last night, and a surprise familiar face popped up! So young and dashing!"
startrek,"My introduction into Star Trek was less direct than many - for me, it was not a series or movie, but copies of Star Trek and Star Trek TNG pocketbooks from my middle school library (Peacekeepers, Strike Zone, etc). So obviously over the years, while I love all Trek series/films differently, I truly have a fondness for non-canon Trek in comic books and novels. 

More recently, I've read both Cast No Shadow (a Valeris-themed book taking place after Kirk's death) and One Constant Star (ENT-B story). Both were very engaging and I really enjoyed the ""Lost Era"" gap-fills.

I'd love to know some of your favorites! The Best of Non-Canon Trek (Books)"
startrek,I'm starting to wonder if their assimilation tech is the most advanced they have. All other tech seems to be from species less develope than themselves? The most advanced tech the Borg has
startrek,"So here I go with a theory of sorts. In the teaser, you can see Captian Pike looking out the shuttlecraft window. The Enterprise NX-01 can be seen in the reflection. The pilot had just mentioned that the ship is ""All scrubbed up and looking like new, sir"" to which Captain Pike responds ""I wish it were that easy""  


I speculate that this might be in regards to Captain John Archers' death, or the NX-01 coming out of mothballs for a reason. Either way, I thought it was pretty cool.

startrek,"So I've been thinking about Brent Spiner and how he might fit into season 3, and I'm thinking with all the ""Butterflies"" combined with the new Jerati friendly non conquering Borg. Perhaps he is going to be Data again and here's how I've come to this conclusion. If the Borg are made to be non conquering friendly Borg then they never would assimilate the El Aurian home world, Sauran and Guinan never end up in the Nexus nor does Kirk because the B doesn't have to rescue them, Sauron therefore never tried to get back to the Nexus so the D is never destroyed, the Borg don't go back to stop first contact so, (and granted this is kind of a leap) but Data would not have been killed trying to save the E from Picard clone. So Data due to the changes is still alive and there reason the entire cast is reuniting for season 3 is because they all, including Data are still serving on board the USS ENTERPRISE 1701-D. Adversely since there was never a Borg threat the Defiant never existed and without WOLF 359 Sisko is still living and serving with Jake and Jennifer who also was never killed. No WOLF 359, meaning quite possibly things were completely different on DS9 because Ben and Jake were never there. Also adversely without the advancements starfleet made due to the Borg the Dominion War probably went alot different too. Thought for Picard Season 3 (some spoilers for season 2)"
startrek,"We know by the time Star Trek happens a lot of diseases have been wiped out, so presumably they don’t bother to vaccinate people against them. If you time travel back to the 21st century you’re suddenly going to be exposed to all these diseases you’ve never seen before.
I had this mental image of McCoy or Crusher reeling off a list of things Kirk or Picard have caught - “You have measles, chicken pox, whooping cough, influenza, diphtheria, malaria, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis and three types of the common cold…” The most dangerous part of time travel?"

startrek,"I just realized that control and the collective have too many in common, in fact, Control is exactly what the Borg would look like if they were created by man. What is your opinion? Do you think that control which we saw in Discovery was actually the predecessor of the Borg, as seen in Picard? And thus, them jumping to the future actually did nothing to escape that destiny?"
startrek,Just wondering if say Crusher was never filmed on the TNG engine room set or anything like that. Does every main cast member have a scene on every main set?
startrek,"Is Discovery perfect? No. I absolutely despised the 1st season. And the 2nd season wasn't much better. But the 3rd season did something that I've been saying NEEDED to happen for Star Trek to survive for a long time: it needed to go into the future (far into the future) so it could ""reinvent"" itself by being far enough out from the previous series so it could be ""fresh"" again (i.e. even farther than TNG was from TOS, but a similar situation). 

And then Discovery did exactly that. It did it in the stupidest way possible, and IMO it would have been better if it had STARTED in the future in the first place (or at least just skipped the first season entirely), but it GOT THERE. And the 3rd season was serviceable Star Trek. Is it too overly emotional for me? Sometimes. But it's REAL STAR TREK from a storytelling and overarching narrative perspective. Season 4 got even better than season 3, and aside from the strangely timed feels and really (REALLY) stupid flamethrowers on the bridge, I enjoyed season 4. They converted me. I HATED Discovery through the end of Season 2. But little by little they broke down my misgivings and I found the Trek they actually embraced through their characters and storytelling in these past 2 seasons.

But I just got done with Picard, Season 2 Episode 9, and my god... what a fucking abomination. Spoilers ahead for anyone who cares.

When Patrick Stewart made that announcement that ""Picard is coming back"" and had all those interviews about how he had all these misgivings and didn't want to tarnish the character and his legacy, I was so confident in his decision and that it would be at least ""good"". Maybe not great, but good.

Season 1 had so many problems, but I didn't absolutely despise it. They bastardized years of character development by killing and/or ruining established legacy characters with bad storytelling and contrived plot devices, but I was willing to look past it because I know that lots of shows, especially Sci-Fi ones, can have a rocky first season as they get shit figured out. I wasn't thrilled that it seemed to go against everything Stewart had promised, but I was hopeful when they showed John de Lancie as Q returning for Season 2 (Picard's greatest nemesis and foil, and one of the best characters and actors to lend their guest stardom to Star Trek). I thought... ""HOW could season 2 get worse than season 1 with Q/John de Lancie around?!"".

But here we are. I don't have the patience to go through the whole season. Needless to say there have been so many reviewers who have done a better job than I could do tearing this waste of time and money apart. But after Episode 9, I just couldn't hold back anymore. The amount of plot holes, disregard for established character traits and universal standards, the complete lack of what seems to be ANY fucks given to coherent storytelling... I am sad. Sad and angry. Sad that, at best, Patrick Stewart and all of these actors and actresses were duped into taking part in one of the worst possible instances of Star Trek ever created, or, at worst, all of these actors and actresses, some I've loved for years from their prior work, knowingly participated in the lowering and tarnishing of the Star Trek name.

I will just list this shit out that either makes no sense, goes against established norms in the Star Trek universe, or is just blatant plot hole territory, and this is JUST from episode 9:

* The ""borg"" reveal their positions with laser-sights that serve no purpose since they have clean shots based on the position of the laser (on Picard and other character's vital spots) but don't take the shots, but disable them when Soong walks in front of them... WHY? Did their need to possibly shoot someone more accurately stop after he walks in front of them?

* Seven, and literally every other character in the show, are trying to sneak around, yet can't SHUT THE FUCK UP and speak in normal voices and make noises while trying to be stealthy. ELNOR LITERALLY SLAMS LOCKERS OPEN AND CLOSED SECONDS AFTER THE QUEEN AND SEVERAL BORG WALK BY THE OPEN DOOR TO THE ROOM HE IS IN. Are they just stupid, or does the show think viewers will not care that they are not paying attention to the details??

* Why does it matter if the ECH/Elnor get hit? He's a hologram with a mobile emitter on. He goes offline when the Queen's tentacle goes through his torso. Why? If she hit the emitter... sure I guess it would make sense. But she didn't. But also...

* ...Why does the Elnor hologram need the mobile emitter at all? The entire ship has holo-emitters, as established multiple times when holograms of Rios have existed all over the ship.

* Why does the Elnor hologram have Elnors memories? Why would he have Elnor's INTERNAL DYING MOMENTS IN ITS MEMORY????? WHY IS IT ELNOR AT LALL?! No explanation is given to this. Why does he know how to use a sword? It makes no sense. Why would a hologram with the ECH programming think a sword would be more efficient than literally any other method in its programming against ""borg"" with guns?

* The story with Picard's mother... why? Why does ANY of this matter? Yeah, I get it, Picard's mother died and he buried the memory, and that's subconsciously why he never settled down with anyone. But why does this matter? They're running for their lives from ""borg"" and Soong but they have time to stop and flashback to his mother hanging herself? There were no records of this he would have come across as an adult (I'm assuming his mother hanging himself would be in some police or autopsy or any number of other records)? Also, it was the fucking 2300's. You're telling me whatever was wrong with her, the only solution was locking her in a room? Using a fucking skeleton key that your child knows where is hidden?

* Also, with regards to Picard's memory, really? REALLY?! How many fucking telepaths over the years have shared Picard's memories and emotions? Troi has known him for how long and never caught a glimpse? Sarek? Spock?!? There was NO HINT of that in there? It took old age and causing a potential huge fuck up to the timeline in order to drag that out of him? Please. PLEASE give me the fucking strength because the character I grew up loving who is the TITLE of the show I don't give 2 shits about now and serves almost no real narrative purpose throughout the entire season.

* Seven is still a complete shell of her former character. She literally said, ""Those aren't people, they're borg"" when they are VERY CLEARLY PEOPLE. They aren't even fully assimilated! They have been assimilated WAY less time than even Picard was as Locutus. Picard FULLY PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY (give or take) RECOVERED from being assimilated COMPLETELY into the collective. EVERY SINGLE PERSON that the Queen ""assimilated"" could be saved... but she's happy to murder them.

* ... and I suppose killing all these ""drones"" has no ripple affects on the timeline, huh? No ""butterflies"" from needlessly killing random people assimilated in the year 2024 could cause guys? None of these people could procreate and help create fucking Zefram Cochrane? Yeah, that's right. He wasn't born until the 2030's. HOW DO THEY KNOW ITS OK TO KILL THESE PEOPLE? Seven and Raffi fucking STAB ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THROUGH THE THROAT! There is no settings on ""stun"" happening here. It's just mass murder.

* In fact, they've done nothing BUT create ""butterflies"". The entire timeline is fucked. It doesn't matter if they undo whatever Q or Soong may or may not do with Renee Picard. They've all created such gigantic temporal fuckups that they're gonna have to go back in time another dozen times just to unkill all the people and undo all the stupid things they've done.

* Seven name-drops Janeway talking about why she didn't join Starfleet, so she's obviously still around and likely still an Admiral. But they didn't let Seven join because she was once a borg? THEN WHY THE FUCK WAS ICHEB ALLOWED IN? He was COMMAND too based on his uniform in the 1st season! He had visible implants and was assimilated for a long time just like Seven. Why was he allowed in? Why was Picard allowed to become an Admiral for that matter? Is ANY Starfleet officer who was assimilated not allowed to be in Starfleet? If so, then why are Janeway, B'Elanna, and Tuvok allowed to remain in starfleet considering they were all assimilated during the Unimatrix Zero episodes (the Doctor's anti-assimilation inoculation wears off and Tuvok even starts hearing the collective, etc)????? What about any number of other Starfleet officers that have been assimilated over the years. Were they all not allowed to rejoin after they recovered?

* Rios is able to instantly decipher and use the wall panel in the Watcher's apartment? Why? How? What? This can likely be explained away with any number of things, but the fact that they don't at any point setup why it is possible or give a clue in the moment as to why he can annoys the shit out of me.

* Where was the Watcher's transport tech the other 100 times the ship's transporter was conveniently on the fritz or not working accurately? WHERE?!

* All of the characters are completely content to allow the ""borg queen"" to get literally exactly what she wants. No objections, no ""WTF?!"" from Picard, nothing. She takes the ship, which is what she ORIGINALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, and leaves. The only way for them to get back. And everyone is fine with it because she ""saved Seven"" after mortally wounding her... Excuse me? Because she has never been deceptive before... at all. Right?!

* WHERE IS Q? Still hanging around somehow able to infiltrate the FBI, create advanced genetic medication that has a built in timer, and/or become an established government-associated psychologist WITHOUT HIS POWERS?

I could keep going, but I'm getting an ulcer.

Needless to say, I don't think there is any saving Picard. And I think they know that given the announcement that they are just saying fuck it and bringing EVERYONE from TNG back for Season 3 so they can wet everyone's whistles one last time who only care about nostalgia and don't give a shit about coherent storytelling, established universe, characters with established backstory, or plots that aren't made of swiss cheese. Fan service is the prime directive of Picard, and it is absolutely infuriating. I love me some fan service normally. But this is just Star Drek: The Next Paycheck to the writers. The lack of care and attention to detail is unforgivable at this point.

startrek,"The speed of the hologram would only be limited by the program and the emitters. With a mobile emitter that advanced, you wouldn't necessarily even need a human body shape, but if that was the most effective, alterring the speed and orientation of the fields should still allow for much faster ""movement"" because it's not movement of anything but light. An Emergency Combat Hologram would move a lot more like Neo in the Mateix than a physical peraon."
startrek,"Just rewatched TMP and it's impossible not to associate it with The Changeling episode, that's been speculated here and elsewhere. 

Memory Beta (non-canon Trek) also speculates some association between V'ger and the Borg (Spock even says, ""Resistance is futile"" in the movie).  What do folk here think about that?

I also had to mention Shatner's open-mouthed ""acting"" in the penultimate scene. The camera cuts to him three times with that same look of befuddlement and I literally laughed out loud. (Tried without luck to find a photo to link).

Also, possibly the worst uniforms in the history of the franchise. What's that black box where a belt buckle would be? the changeling, TMP, the BORG and Kirk"
startrek,"Discovery is very a modern show. It is in line with what contemporary audiences expect in terms of pacing, style, direction, acting, etc.. It has mostly new characters, and lean as heavily on a familiarity with Trek as Picard and Lower Decks do.
I think the show has been successful is expanding what Trek ""is"". As a result however, it doesn't feel indicative of Trek as a whole. It does not feel like a successor to the Star Trek of old in the way that TNG did or even Voyager and Enterprise. While a good recommendation for a show, all this makes it tough to direct folks to watch when they are looking to get into the franchise.

Nearly 30 years after its release, TNG is still the best entry point to the franchise and giving a sense what it is (largely) all about. That said as much as I love it as an entry point for new fans it is not without its flaws. Like all entertainment(Discovery included), it is a product of its time. The style, acting, pacing, effects, directing, etc. can be a barrier for some. As much as it bums me out, there are plenty of people out there who just can't get into older shows. Of course, there is also the issue with the first couple seasons being weak and especially dated. Its hard to explain to folks that they should start in a specific season, or even a specific episode.

Enter Strange New Worlds. It promises a return to form in terms of classic Trek stories and episodic storytelling. On the other hand, from all I've seen it is also an unmistakably modern show. Something to carry the baton of TOS and TNG. It has iconic characters and settings (Spock, the Enterprise, Uhura) that general audiences are familiar with. It allows them to go in feeling like they have some degree of comfort and familiarity, without feeling like they need to have seen another show to enjoy. If all of these elements are executed well, it had the potential to be ""the best of both worlds"". Here's hoping!

tl;dr : A show which looks to present a sense of what quintessential Trek ""is"", in a highly accessible and modern package. Prediction/Hope: Strange New Worlds will be the best new entry point to the franchise."
startrek,"How is the distinction between universes vs timelines drawn?

I would've thought that the existence of a multiverse means it's just an endless web of different universes spawning from every choice being made differently.

Like the mirror universe spun off when Z.C. shot the first contact Vulcuns rather than greeting them (or diverged before that at whatever point made Z.C. the type of person who'd do that). 

But then you see all sorts of examples in Star Trek, without spoiling anything going on recently, of ""they changed our timeline"". Like the Borg going back in First Contact leads to earth changing for the Enterprise while it's stuck in the temporal wake. Mean, the Kevlin timeline seems to be a new universe created by a trip from the Prime timeline going back into its past and its arrival being the start of this new branch universe. It didn't ""change the timeline"" so that Vulcun was destroyed in the prime universe.

How are these different perspectives on time travel and multiverses reconciled? I don't remember this being addresses in the physics of star trek though I read that 25 years ago when I was in elementary school haha. Different universe vs different timeline"
startrek,"El-Aurians and the Q are the same people, just evolved differently (would explain the truce). The first time we encounter the Borg, Q whisked 1701D to the Delta quadrant under the pretext that there were dangers out there that humans weren't ready for. We know the Borg destroyed the El-Aurians homeworld, so Q actually fears the Borg as they are attempting to duplicate what the Q achieved but through technology instead.

With the 400 year lead on technology now, they might have reached their goal and are killing off the Q. Q and the Borg theory"
startrek,Voyager is the one I pull up the most. I think it’s because it was the first tv show I really got into and would record on old VHS tapes to watch later. I really liked some of the characters and could see myself hanging out with them more than characters in the other series. Which series do you find yourself re-visiting?

startrek,"How come when the main ship loses weapons, they don't launch a couple and use them? Besides ending a story too quickly, I would think that would have helped out a few times. If shuttle crafts have weapons...."
startrek,"So something came to mind recently when I was thinking about Picard season 2, something no one's talking about. 

If the Borg Queen on the Star Gazer is Jurati, then there would be two Juratis at once since we saw one of them was on the bridge already. This is evidence that both the Federation and Confederation timelines will occur in parallel, since without the Confederation timelines existing, Jurati wouldn't have gone back in time and become the new Borg Queen. 

So what I think is gonna happen is the Sirena crew will cause both timelines to happen in the finale episode. Then Q will bring them back to the moment before they self destruct the Stargazer, since he took them away from there in the first place. Even if they tried to go back to the 25th century through time travel, who knows what timeline they would end up in? That's why Q needs to be involved. 

Then the new Borg will join the Federation. Agnes will be alive as herself. Rios will be there at the captains chair even if he stays in the past. Elnor will be alive at Starfleet academy. This is because the versions of those characters who stayed in the past or died were the Confederation timelines version of themselves, simply made lucid to both timelines by Q. 

What I don't know is how they will handle memory. Will Rios and Jurati somehow remember the events that played out in the past? Will Elnor remember dying? Theory: Why the Sirena crew don't need the ship to get home. And why all the main cast will be alive when they return to the 25th century."

startrek,"Personally, I think its Dr Polaski in season 2 of TNG. most attractive character in all of star trek?"
startrek,"I've seen people talking a lot about issues with plot megalomania and narrative pace in early Discovery and now Picard, and I count myself among them.

I really, really, really wanted to love Picard. I wanted it to be my all time favorite TV series. It just happens to be kinda... boring. The plot is grandiose and full of melodramatic conflict, it's action packed like an 80's movie, and still, I rarely feel engaged to it.

I think since the Abrams movies, Trek as a whole got dragged to a genre it doesn't really belong. The effort to reach new audiences with more action oriented plots is admirable, but I think it's fair to admit at this point that it didn't seem to work.

It got us into Space Opera territory, which is a great genre full of great stories, but when overimposed to Trek's traditional lore, it deforms it into weird shapes.

In my opinion, Trek's ""native language"" flows best in episodes focused on team mates cooperating to solve puzzles (independently of how bogus the science or challenge; it's the quality of their interaction and the innate pleasure of slowly watching something broken get fixed that counts) and the personal relations of a group of people who are among the best at their respective fields, and have to cope with the stress of the most high stakes job in the whole planet. While learning the Trombonne.

The exact mix of the crazy unpredictability of the challenges a crew of explorers may face in unknown space and the hardships of the everyday life of a high standard super professional is what makes the greatest Trek, imo. And those are the aspects that have been mostly absent in the most recent Trek.

There has been zero ""gossip at the buffet line"" scenes in the most recent Trek.

Nobody had to get ready to a Seminar.

There's been no stiff dates between socially weird science officers.

These examples may sound silly when compared with the kind of shenanigans going on in the shows, but I think that says lots about why Space Opera Trek doesn't captivate a large segment of Trek fans. It's just not as relatable. Trek doesn't work as a Space Opera, it shines the most as Procedural Sci-Fi/Workplace Dramedy"

startrek,"so we know of the Hybrid Queen  in S.1   so I guess we know she gets to that timeline with Juradi,  

but through out this while ""preventing the future thing""

&amp;#x200B;

 why is the Borg Queen wanting 400 years to PREP for the Confederation

and not contemplating on preventing it along with Picard and Co.

&amp;#x200B;

 I mean,  shes from a future where the Borg and Aliens are just Wiped out by the Humans.

being around Picard and CO (since shes plucked from her TIMELINE)  (she would be an anomaly / someone from a Future that no long exists) 

so far, how does she not  wonder what the TNG Prime Borg are like - because she'd have to assume, looking at the Romulan - and 7 of 9 That, perhaps the Borg of TNG are stronger and better.  because 7 of 9 is LIVING proof of this.   she  may not be Borg atm but she is in TNG timeline.    the Queen isn't the Last of her Kind there.

besides the wonder of how a ""confederation"" of humans only, wipe out the Borg. ontop of every non Human race in the Galaxy? but yet, this Queen doesnt think that somehow the Borg are still around in the TNG timeline?

if I were in that position ,   I would do all that I could, to prevent my future (just like Picard and CO are doing)  and I would  get my ass in the TNG timeline since I'd been plucked from my Future already - so I am an Anomaly. Id want to connect with this ""better Borg"" of the Primetimeline, instead of sitting 400 years prior and Prep for MY Confederation Future - that this WHOLE group is trying to Prevent.  and knowing the Queen was the Last surviving Borg.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean,  if you were from a crap future,  and some TimeLine Variants show up and Pluck you away to prevent it all --    why would YOU want to come back to YOUR Confederation Future.

knowing the Borg of TNG is alive -  would be a huge objective for me to contact. 

instead of trying -defend- my future inevitability . Question about ""Confederation"" Borg Queen and her.. Objective"

I find her to be disruptive and poorly written - I dislike her mainly. She is a minor antagonist at best.

I feel like her only affinity is for being a warmonger. A real piece of work who dislikes any form of diplomacy. She very rarely agrees with Burnham and when she does so, it's with dismay and pressure from others.  


Would you agree with me on this topic or offer a counter point as to why she is a good character who has a place on the show worth her time on screen?

startrek,"The Enterprise is arguably the most important cast member of TNG, and with the core cast of TNG coming back it raises the question.

Will the Enterprise be brought back as the main ship of season 3 of Picard?

It sounds like season 3 of Picard might not just be a finale to Picard itself, but to TNG as a whole.

It makes sense to put Picard back in the Captain's chair as he leads his crew to save humanity and the Federation one last time

So, assuming the Enterprise comes back as the main ship in Season 3, which one do you think they will use?

The iconic Enterprise-D that is still one of Star Trek's most famous ship?  Or the Enterprise-E which served the TNG crew well through three films.   Or maybe we get a brand new Enterprise like a F or something.

But what does everyone think?   Are we gonna see the Enterprise finally return in Picard Season 3? With the main TNG cast confirmed to return in Picard Season 3, do you think the Enterprise will return as well in an important role?"

First My Thoughts: So throughout this series we have dealt with Picard's inter-social issues and his past traumas.  Personally speaking, this is BS and it bogs the show down half the time in my opinion.  Picard is a strong man who like Kirk before him ""needs his pain"" to remind him of his Humanity; while he was anti-social on the Enterprise it was also justified.  He is the captain and as such its not professional or wise to pursue long term relationships or form attachments with the people under his command.  Over time its obvious in his own way that he cares for his people and he does show it more than once -he IS NOT traumatized from childhood and I don't think much of STP should be considered canon.  

\*\*So here we go, this is my ending for the series.  Please be patient.\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

Picard wakes up sweating and confused (perceiving strange computer noises) until he clearly hears Doctor Crusher speaking to him.  She is happy to see him awake and alert and explains that he has been doing very badly at a Starfleet medical facility she had him moved to in San Francisco.  During the end of TNG it was predicted that he would have ""Irumodic Syndrome"" that would cause delusions and essentially make him senile.  In the AGT episode it was based roughly around 2395, which fits with STP's time line.  There is still no cure and Picard sits back in his bed and contemplates his fate -that soon he may slip back into his dementia and never return to reality.  Shortly after the crew of the Enterprise returns to wish him well and essentially say their goodbyes.  Its at this time, with all that hes experienced in the STP episodes, he realizes that these people were his family and he tearfully wishes them all long happy lives knowing what lays ahead for him.  He knows this will be the last time he sees them. 

Geordi who is now a captain himself tells him that his ship is leaving orbit soon for a dangerous but fascinating first contact mission in unexplored space.  Picard is delighted and envious, wishing he too could be part of the adventure.  That's when Captain La Forge tells Jean-Luc that he is in fact the new skipper of the Enterprise-F (Odyssey Class from Star Trek: Online) and then asks Picard if he may have a memento to place in his new ready room.  Picard smiles and says: ""if I cannot be with you in body, at least I will be there in spirit.""  Geordi is visibly upset that his mentor is now too sick to continue on and seeing this Picard tells Geordi to ALWAYS, no matter what, ""Boldly go where no one has gone before...""  At this point the TNG music kicks up and we see Geordi beam to the Enterprise-F; a few minutes later a book or other keepsake is beamed to the Enterprise from France and Geordi looks at it fondly as he reclines back into his chair and the helmsman remarks ""course laid in, captain.""  Geordi smiles and says, ""MAKE IT SO!""  We then see the new Enterprise-F go into warp as the music drifts off into space and the adventure continues...  

I know this is a bit shortened, but its not a screen play just a rough outline.  I don't like this new Picard but it makes a lot more sense if you consider him mentally ill and delusional.  It would explain why Seven seems so dumb down on her capabilities and why the story lines seem so choppy and poorly written sometimes.  In essence each delusional character can represent a part of Picard that hes struggling with:

**Raffi:** An angry and impulsive person that is having trouble dealing with loss.  This echoes Picard's acknowledgement of his mental deterioration.

**Rios:** Picard's desire to be a young man and back in command again where he was happiest in his life.

**Jurati:** A smart but socially awkward person that is disconnected from others around her, much like Picard when he was maintaining distance from people in his life.  A part of him couldn't allow himself to connect with someone long term and its a regret that haunts him.  He wanted a connection with his crew, the people he cared most about, but isolation was his constant companion.

**Seven/Borg Queen:** A tie to his Borg past when he felt out of control and helpless; trying to fight back against the inevitable (his disease) while dealing with his guilt from Wolf 359.

**Q:** A reminder of urgent danger and struggle.  Something to focus on to keep him grounded and moving forward -much like Q did in the last episode of TNG when he was shifting through time to save the future.

**Dahj:** A reminder of Data's legacy and his strong desire to have Data back in his life after his painful loss on Shinzon's ship.

**Laris:** His desire to be with someone he loves and actually show that side of his personality without feeling vulnerable and idiotic.  A life he could have had if he hadn't joined Starfleet -its also possible she is real and living at the vineyard and a part of him does care deeply for her.

I know my choices may or may not be well received.  We Trek fans are a fickle bunch. haha  With the passing of Picard and the new missions of the Enterprise-F we see the realization of the saying: ""All good things must come to an end.""  That said, it doesn't mean that life wont continue on through others.  I'm tired of revamps and prequels.  Lets get back to the 90's Trek style of story telling that made Star Trek so good to begin with!  NuTrek could be good if the right writers/actors get behind it...  I fear if it doesn't happen, Star Trek may disappear forever and only be remembered for the new stuff and not the old. An Idea For The Last STP Episode"
startrek,"The three that come to mind for me are

* John Lithgow. Lithgow has some good dramatic chops and I think it'd be really cool to see him as Dr Boyce in SNW. He doesn't need to be a regular cast or anything, maybe just give him an episode for his retirement where he's mixing drinks and opining on how he's watched Pike grow over the years.

* Jamie Clayton. I don't actually have a specific role in mind for her, I just really like her work and want to see her in Star Trek.

* Lamorne Morris. I loved Morris in New Girl and Woke and I think he could really bring something to any series he'd be in. I think like James Avery, he could do a lot of really good episodes from the fun and goofy to hard allegories. What actors would you like to see join the franchise (either as one-offs, recurring, or main cast)?"
startrek,"I would love it if they explored this time. The writers would have full opportunity to play on the range of different emotions that Vulcans would have more readily as opposed to the Vulcans we're familiar with. We could also dive into the ""first"" Romulans during the schism and how they started out. Thoughts on a show that solely focused on Vulcan during Surak's time?"
startrek,"I'm a TNG guy at heart, that was my Trek (was 10 when it started in '87). I grew up with it, so when they announced *Picard* I was really pumped.

Overall, I don't hate it, but it's definitely not (to my mind) as solid as the original series in terms of writing, ensemble cast, etc.

When *Discovery* came out, I *wanted* to like that show. I watched as much of it as I could stand, but aside from the issues that have been repeated ad infinitum here, the thing that most pulled me out of the show was that characters *regularly* would have deep, meaningful conversations about their emotions and other things in the middle of pitched action sequences.

Discovery didn't have *any* downtime from the action, but they wanted to be a drama and have characters that the viewers were supposed to care about. But with no time for character development between action scenes, they ended up shoehorning in these deep conversations when the world was coming down around the characters' ears. And in turn, that ruined (for me) the actual scenes. If you're in the middle of an action scene, but seem to have time to talk about your feelings while staring deep into the other character's eyes, do I really believe there's anything actually at stake?

*Picard* is now doing the same thing. I counted five separate instances of that in Ep. 09 while I watched last night-- characters in time-sensitive action sequences, and they're stopping to tell other characters (who are stopping to listen) all about their feelings, hopes, dreams, memories, etc.

I suppose this is a weakness of the format. We have a show about characters who (mostly) are supposed to be known to us, but for those who haven't seen the source material-- and for the sake of new material-- they want to have character development. But they have no *time* for character development.

I find that to be a real weakness of the modern Trek, and I hope that SNW doesn't make this mistake as well. Maybe it's the distilled story arc format that these miniseries follow, and maybe the return to something like episodic TV will help with that.

But I'm not optimistic... Watching Picard last night solidified it for me; it's got the same pacing / drama problem that originally turned me off Discovery. (no spoilers)"
startrek,"Borg Queen Jurati drops this line like the Borg were invented during their first encounter with the Enterprise D... And this isn't the first time it's been implied this season, although I'll admit I can't remember exactly when.

I'm fairly certain the Borg existed for millennia and are still expanding their drones as they speak. Then I thought it might be a reference to assimilating Earth but the Queen specifically mentions travelling to the Delta Quadrant to do it.

Maybe the Queen means they need to expand even faster than they already are. What about all the people with guns who have Borg nano probes in their blood? Surely someone discovered them in the wall at some point before the D encounters that first cube?

Then the end of the episode happens and I'm like... Did they just do a Borg origin story?

I think I'm just tired of them continuing to neuter the Borg. Jurati just talked the Queen down. It's not a new take, but they should've always been just a mysterious force of nature that would show up outta nowhere every now and then to fuck shit up then leave. ""We have 400 additional years to expand the collective""... What?"
startrek,"Hi peeps.

startrek,"My prediction is:

\*How many more times must we &gt;!meet another corrupt Soong family member?&lt;

\*If the Borg are all-powerful, &gt;!why must they bother with inferior ships and tech? For that matter, why don't they just visit Earth in the 1150s, land on some castle and be like what up&lt;

\*&gt;!Why did Seven's implants disappear when going back in time? And if the explanation is that we are seeing her in a separate timeline where she was never assimilated, then why do the implants get restored to the same spots on her body when she is healed by Jurati/Queen&lt;

startrek,"This came up In the thread from the other day and I just rewatched it. I totally forgot about their last ditch effort to launch that probe with their logs in it that failed and was destroyed at the last second.

I wish they would have let them contact the other voyager it at least reference the goo voyager as the real one caught up to them. “Haven’t we seen you before” “oh those were out doubles”. But I guess that would violate the no multi episode arc rule.

startrek," Ok, so, hear me out, and correct me if I view things wrong.

So far I've enjoyed DIS(Season 1-3), ENT (all of it), TNG (currently S6) and VOY (all of it), and I'm currently viewing the second season of DS9.

First of all, I have really enjoyed Star Trek thus far, but in each series there is a mayor nasty (for lack of a better word) quirk.

&amp;#x200B;

What follows are some examples of those quirks (again, I really enjoyed these series):

**Enterprise**

(spoiler series finale)

&gt;!At the end of the series, Trip dies. which in my opinion didn't really contribute any content to the series...!&lt;

**TNG** (spoiler around end season 1)

&gt;!around the end of season 1, Tasha Yar dies quite abruptly!&lt;

**VOY** (spoiler S4E2)

&gt;!Kes leaves and for some reason Voyager is launched a few years closer to home!&lt;

**DIS** (spoiler end S2, and to be honest a really big rant)

&gt;!Discovery season 3 greatly frustrated me because of the time travel to the future, first of all because it constrains (real-time) future star trek series by for example changing the name of Vulcan. Not to mention they overhauled the whole star trek ideology in that season  by creating a dystopian future where the federation is greatly limited (in contrast to for example TNG which starts writing stories from a utopian point of view). My frustration may be displaced because the series got removed from Netflix about a week before the release of season 4 and I live in a country where Paramount+ is not available.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**My point**

While I like to categorise ENT, TNG and VOY as great series inside the Star Trek universe, I find it weird that all of these series have a nasty 'quirk' like I mentioned in my examples.... so... do all great Star Trek Series have a 'quirk'? (I am scared for this possible 'quirk' inside DS9) 

Are there any more experienced Trekkies who could confirm/correct my theory?  
Thanks for reading this far. Do all great Star Trek series have a nasty quirk?"
startrek,"I've been extremely disappointed in Discovery &amp; Picard. I had high hopes for both. IMHO, they are missing many of the storytelling components that I've loved about Star Trek over the decades. I know many fans enjoy these shows, and to them I say, IDIC.

I was cautiously optimistic about Lower Decks before it premiered. After the pilot episode, I felt like it was just a silly cartoon with a bunch of Star Trek references. But, as the first season progressed, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. The show has depth, character development, and it is very funny. After two full seasons of Lower Decks, I'm hooked and want more.

I did not have high expectations for Prodigy. I though it might be watchable but didn't expect to really get into it. I *really* did not like the two-part pilot and was afraid the entire show would be terrible. The next episode didn't impress me much either. But then, it kept getting better. By the mid-season break, I was shocked by how much I was enjoying the show. It successfully mixes a serialized storyline with strong standalone episodes and keeps building upon mysteries which are genuinely intriguing. I cannot wait to see the rest of the season.

I never would have guessed that, out of four new Trek shows, my two favorites would be animated. 

Fingers crossed for Strange New Worlds! Lower Decks &amp; Prodigy FTW"
startrek,"im being curious about this..

like i dont think its being a big deal lol but im wondering what is the reason for this being in the first place why this was happening..

i was hearing some thing on this sub reddit about their being a explanation in the show but im wondering what that explanation was being and im wondering what the explanation in real life-like not in side of the show- was being for why this was happening..

picard is my favorite character and tng is being my favorite show so im not having any problems or being complaining..just being curious.. Why was picard being cast with french name and britain accent? Was there ever being a explanation for this?"
startrek,"Just like season 1: they set up characters and a mystery for a big payoff, then seem to just run out of episodes and skip logic and continuity to wrap it all up. They could take a lesson from Lower Decks which makes a point of tying loose ends and maintaining continuity and plot element payoff. ST:P stops making sense in the last 2 episodes"
startrek,"Just a bit of idle curiosity.

You get a ship.  Any ship you want.  Which do you take?

Personally?  I think I'm going for a Rhode Island class (the refit Nova).  I don't need a floating city like the Galaxy, and I don't need a full on war machine like the Defiant either.

Always loved the Nova, and the Rhode Island class is a Nova with her problems fixed and whoo boy, sign me up! What Ship Would You Want?"

startrek,"I want divide the room-level opinions. 

For me, DS9 *far and away* has the best roster of characters in any of the series. I'm including TNG and TOS. Some of individual characters may be cooler than others, but as a whole cast, nothing has topped how singular, interesting, and 3-dimensional DS9's cast was. What are your spiciest takes on the franchise?"
startrek,"I know SPS balded hella early, but is this also true for Picard? Is Picard balding early canon?"
startrek,"- The episode title, “Hide and Seek”, of course refers to the children’s game, which has been referenced many times across Trek, and is apparently cross-cultural, as Rom jokes, *“Now you go hide and I’ll search for you,”* in “The Magnificent Ferengi” when Quark claims he’s been looking for Rom all over the station.

    - We actually see the game played in “Fortunate Son” and “True Q”

    - Q’s second appearance was in the similarly titled, “Hide and Q”, which actually has very little hiding, an adequate amount of Q, and more animal like soldiers dressed in 18th century French uniforms than you might expect.

- Queen Jurati dons the Borg Queen’s exo-skeleton, something we’ve seen happen previously in “First Contact”. Of course, that iteration of the Queen appeared to only have meat bits from the shoulders up, and Jurati appears to still be mostly intact, more or less.

    - The brief shot of the Queen’s corpse after Jurati absorbs the exo-skeleton torso does appear to have been hollowed out.

- Tallinn’s weapons are a disruptor pistol, and a disruptor rifle, both Romulan make matching the ones the Tal Shiar death squads were using in season one.

- *”So myopically linear.”* The Borg Queen has a habit of deriding others for not have an expanded perspective, as established in “First Contact”.

- The *La Sirena* is able to create an Emergency Combat Hologram based on Elnor, despite the fact that Elnor was only alive on this Confederation iteration of *La Sirena* for only a few minutes at best before being killed.

    - The Emergency Elnor Hologram comes pre-equipped with a mobile emitter, which also seems to be a hologram? In the unaltered timeline, the mobile emitter was at least derived from the technology of a 29th century timeship, if not a product of the 29th century flat out. No indication of how the Confederation would have managed to develop identical technology.

- *”Those aren’t people out there, they’re Borg.”* Add Seven of Nine, former Borg Drone, to the ever expanding list of people in Star Trek who need therapy, but clearly refuse to get help.

    - Seven’s sentiment does match Picard’s in “First Contact”: *”You may encounter Enterprise crewmembers who've already been assimilated. Don't hesitate to fire. Believe me you'll be doing them a favour.”*

- Young Picard has models of a Reliant-class starship, the Promellian battle cruiser in a bottle that was mentioned in “Booby Trap” and seen earlier this season in adult Picard’s study, and what appears to be a Columbia-class refit of the NX-class starship which was previously exclusive to beta canon.

- The ground combat with the Borged out ex-special forces goons does not seem particularly dangerous, though the threat of the Borg has never been their combat prowess as opposed to their ability to keep throwing drones at a situation and adapt.

- Seven reveals to Raffi that she attempted to join Starfleet after the *USS Voyager* returned to Federation space, but she was denied due to her status as a former Borg.

    - Janeway threatened to resign to get Starfleet to reconsider their stance, similar to Picard resigning to pressure Starfleet into continuing the Romulan rescue mission.

    - We know that Icheb did manage to become a Starfleet officer. Not only was he Borg for a shorter period of time than Seven, presumably Janeway advocated for him as well, even after Seven decided to go *”Full ranger.”*

- The Emergency Elnor Hologram implies that he has some of Elnor’s last memories and emotions, but not all.

- Seven transports the Borg into the walks fo the catacombs beneath the Chateáu Picard. In “Strange New World” we saw a member of the *NX-01* crew merged with rocks, leaves and other debris blowing around during a transport in a storm, and we saw a Starfleet officer embedded with a corridor floor in “In Theory”, in a somewhat disturbing scene that may have stuck with some younger viewers at the time well into adulthood.

    - This does raise the question of whether or not the Borg are still stuck beneath the Chateáu centuries later. Obviously we don’t see them in any of Jean-Luc’s flashbacks, but we know his explorations of these catacombs were limited. On the other hand, someone may have 

- *“I’m proposing that what you’ve written off as weakness is actually strength. Cooperation.”* Chakotay encountered a co-operative of former Borg in “Unity”. They briefly used him to re-establish their collective.

    - At the end of the episode, “Temporal Edict”, we were given a glimpse of a classroom at some unknown point in the future where Borg toddlers were learning about the history of Starfleet, along with humans, Ferengi, and Caitians.

- Queen Jurati reassimilates Seven to save her life, giving her…exactly the same implants as she had before? No indication of how much of Seven’s internal implants have reappeared, or the replacement eye seen in the alternate future of “Timeless”.

- Picard tells Tallinn he *“used to imagine seeing her, older, offering [him] a cup of tea.”* We saw one of those imaginations in “Where No One Has Gone Before”.

- Young Picard’s tie has the same knot that he wore last season in “Remembrance” during the Federation News Network interview.

- *“Too succeed there must be two Renées, one who lives, and another who dies.”* Star Trek has many ways to create a duplicate of someone, including:

    - Transporter accident

    - Android duplicate

    - Mirror universe doppelganger

    - Holographic double

startrek,"So finding out that the Borg Queen we see in episode 1 of season 2 of Picard is probably Jurati was a completely off the wall discovery and I never would have been able to guess it was her. If you guessed that it was Jurati, what on earth led you to make that crazy f-ing guess? How did you know the Borg Queen was Jurati"
startrek,"I just finished watching ""Hide and Seek"" and I'm absolutely shocked. How can Picard's father be displayed as ""the good one"", when he's the one who locked up his mother in her room denying her of professional help? Her suicide is in no way Picard's fault.

Near the end Picard says that he imagined her as an old woman implying that she would have survived if they had kept her locked up most of the time for the rest of her live.

I've learned a few interesting stories about how different characters got their names. I'm wondering if anybody else here has anything else to add.  Stories like:

* Montgomery Scott was named after James Doohan's grandfather
* Christine Chapel is a pun on the Sistine Chapel
* William Riker is almost a direct copy of William Decker (since Riker was pretty much a recycled conception from the Phase II/TMP development process)
* Odo was deliberately named with a palindrome, to reflect his ""inscrutable"" personality (the Cardassian ""nothing"" explanation was invented later)
* Morn = Norm
* Jonathan Archer was originally going to be named ""Jackson Archer"", until a public records search revealed there is \*exactly one\* real person named Jackson Archer in the US, and they wanted to avoid any possible legal accusations that the character was named after one person specifically
* Khan Noonien Singh and Noonien Soong were both attempts by Gene Roddenberry to reconnect with somebody he knew from his Air Force days.  (And now we have another character from that lineage in the SNW cast.) How characters got their names"

""Lets make everything dark and gritty and more gothic""  Picard falls back and is not the same character from TNG.  He doesn't follow his same morals.  Like I said, I'm torn because I want to like it, but the further it goes on, I don't.. 

Discovery is doing the same with the ""lets add a ton of CGI and make it darker"".  But that is at least a new cast/story/ship/etc...  So I can chose to like it.  I hope Strange New Worlds does not follow this and goes back to the original star trek look/feel or TNG at least

Trill memory?"
startrek,"I've watched all of Discovery, mostly enjoyed it but have a laundry list of critiques. They haven't stopped me from watching it, though. 

The new season of Picard, though? It started off so strong but the last two episodes have been awful. I see a lot of fan theories justifying how things happen, which is fine, but we shouldn't have to fill in these sloppy gaps from just legitimately awful writing. 

Deep breath:

\-How did Soong get a small army of mercenaries within 24 hours?  
\-Why did Soong accompany them on the mission when he isn't a combatant?  
\-Why do they have green lasers after being assimilated?  
\-How does Jurati-Queen assimilate someone's consciousness without Jurati having any visible upgrades / the Queen is just running around in her neuropathways? A human couldn't do a mind mild and this shouldn't work either  
\-Why the emphasis on action in almost every episode with guns and explosions? If this was true to TNG, the episode 9 would have been Picard and Q negotiating with the Jurati-Queen and it would have been a philosophical fight, not Seven and Raffi sprinting 50 yards with a corkscrew and somehow surviving 12 mercenaries with laser sights  


Q and Guinan are painfully underutilized. Introducing them and then not having them be in the majority of the show is worse than not having them at all. 

There are still some great character moments and fleshing out Picard's backstory is fine. The tragedy of his mother provides a ton of context about who he is as a person (and his vision in Season 1 of TNG where he sees his mother as an old woman). I actually like the idea that the Borg Queen, in isolation, could be persuaded to be less ruthless / better. But do we have to wade through so much nonsense to get there? People hate on Discovery, but the most recent episode of Picard (S2E9) is maybe the worst writing from any modern Trek I've seen."

startrek,"I'm watching ""Strange New Worlds: Inside the Series"" on Paramount+'s youtube channel... Producer Henry Myers is talking about Uhura and stated, ""With approaching Uhura, we felt it was really important to show a different perspective. And we had this unique opportunity to show an Uhura who is different from any Uhura that we'd seen before: Someone who is young, who is good at what she does, but not the assured future captain that she will eventually become.""

Add to that, in Picard Season 2, we see a reference to a ship that Uhura would eventually captain. Until that, I always assumed that Uhura retired at the rank of Commander after the events of STVI, but the placard that was made for Picard gives Uhura's career another *40 years.* Uhura's birth date was never firmly established, but the date that's been suggested implies she doesn't retire from the captain's seat until her mid-90's (for reference, Nichelle Nichols is currently 89 years old). It's almost like they wanted to leave the door open for Nichols to make a cameo appearance.

The placard shown in Picard states that Uhura got her own 5-year mission in 2301, and she participated in over 100 first contact missions during that time. Uhura remained in command of her ship when it became an Academy training vessel in 2317. Ten years later, Captain Uhura was still commanding when Cadet Jean-Luc Picard had his first faster-than-light experience.

I'm super excited to see Uhura's character developed in SNW, and I can't wait to see where they take her character. Is there a Captain Uhura series in the pipeline?"
startrek,"Hello,

I finished the TGN (for the second time) and I've never seen any other Star Trek. I enjoyed TGN immensly.

I  tried a few episodes of Discovery but damn. DAMN. I don't know the  words to describe the abomination. How can they pour money into  something so incredibly stupid? I tried thinking about it as an ""LGBTQ+  fan finction from a gender neutral lesbian that read about ST on  wikipedia"" sort of a deal but at 5th episode I just gave up.

I prefer the ""one story per episode"" sitcomy kind of storytelling.

I'm afraid Picard will ruin TGN for me so I'm steering clear for now.

For those who are fortunate not to know, Paramount Plus doesn't stream in the UK, nor have they announced a date for which they will become available. They have also not gave any indication on how people in the UK can watch SNW. I know its not just the UK this affects, so there will be a huge chunk of fans who cannot legally watch a major new ST show. Which is going to hurt the franchise as a whole as so many people will have see spoilers months or years before they can see the show. That also means people like myself will have to stay away from Star Trek subreddits and other places in which fans get together to share theories and talk about the show.

In Family, Robert says something along the lines of how Jean-Luc monopolized Yvette, which made him identify more with Maurice.

So why is Robert not in the flashbacks? Because Jean-Luc either doesn't remember Robert being there or his memories of his mother have written him out of them.

If we were to see the objective past of what happened with their mother, yes, Robert would be there, but we're seeing subjective memories. Why we don't see Robert in Picard's flashbacks."

startrek,"**TLDR; Picard and Q split the universe in two in order to prevent a paradox.**

Episode 10 airing on May 5th will close out season 2 of Star Trek Picard, and they will have to wrap up a lot of arcs. Here are my predictions for how the show will finish, and potentially set up the final season of Star Trek Picard.

Queen Aggie has flown off on the Confederation version of La Sirena to start her new 21st century ""Cooperative,"" but left Picard a tantalizing clue as to how the future could be saved. ""*The mission must not be postponed. To succeed, there must be two Renées. One who lives and another who dies.*""

Q himself also left a clue in episode 2 ""Penance"" -- ""*Show them a world of their own making and they ask you what you've done.*"" If what Q is saying is true, Picard and his crew created the conditions that developed into the Confederation. Because we're dealing with time-travel, Picard and his crew **WILL** create those conditions, but haven't done it yet. 

A lot of things have already been set in motion and we're barreling towards a predestination paradox. In Penance, Q tells Picard he ""intervened"" during the explosion which destroyed the Stargazer. I propose that the predestination paradox began when the Borg ship emerged from the subspace rip. Here's where it gets tricky.

That borg ship in the 25th century belongs to Queen Aggie of the new Borg Cooperative. Behind that clockwork mask is the smiling face of Agnes Jurati. She survived from the 21st all the way to the 25th century, but she lived in a universe very different from Picard's own.

In her Universe, Renée Picard died. She had to, because the Queen's lineage was that of a Borg who was nearly completely decimated by the Confederation. Her assimilated La Sirena came from the Confederation. In order for her own existence to be secured, the Confederation must exist. Adam Soong must be able to save the Earth, and Renée Picard has to die.

But her existence also relies on Agnes Jurati and Jean-Luc Picard from the Federation. They too, must exist. The only way for the Federation to exist is for Renée Picard to live and to succeed. So how can both seemingly contradictory events occur?

""*To succeed, there must be two Renées. One who lives and another who dies.*""

""*Show them a world of their own making and they ask you what you've done.*""

Picard and crew will have to create a situation where their universe essentially splits. One where Renée  makes it to Europa and the Federation evolves appropriately, and another where she dies and Soong becomes the savior of a xenophobic Earth; two Renées. 

They lack the power and ability to split the entire universe into two independent versions. You know who does? Q. Sure, his power is failing, but maybe it's not completely failed. Q himself said, ""*Can a single act redeem a lifetime?*"" Q will summon nearly everything he has left to create a schism that will allow both universes to exist simultaneously. In one, Renée will go on to succeed in her mission and the Federation will live on. In the other, Renée dies and the Confederation also lives. 

Two Renées, two universes, no paradox.

Queen Aggie, the physical embodiment of both universes, won't wink out of existence and will return, the long way, to the 25th century where she will set things in motion. How will Picard and crew return to the 25th century? Perhaps through Tallinn's technology? Maybe a final act of humanity from Q? It's a McGuffin either way. 

Season 3 begins with a seemingly restored Federation and everything is fine and dandy. Except the Confederation now exists and, having defeated a Galaxy's worth of foes, witnesses a Borg vessel rip through subspace into a ""neighboring"" universe. That universe teems with humanity and alien-life intermingling and ::shudders: interbreeding and simply can't allow that to stand. Watch out, Jean-Luc -- they are coming for you.

Just thought I would tag that because the setting of Picard's flashbacks is intentionally Victoriam feeling (in keeping with how he has viewed his past and his alternate future in the Nexus) and but he was born into a wider universe and that's also part of his character. in the early 2310s while the Picard family tragedy unfolded,"
startrek,"I was surprised at how this wound up for me, especially at the top and middle of the list. Definitely didn't line up with my recollections:  


1. ***First Contact*** \-- This is an *incredible* film. The plot involves a ridiculous number of threads: the Borg, time travel, first contact, Data and the Borg Queen, Picard and Lily. But it manages to handle them all clearly so you always know what's going on. Jonathan Frakes' direction keeps the pace up so it doesn't collapse under its own weight. It shouldn't work, but it does in a way that reminded me of what *Infinity War* and *Endgame* will go on to do (in their own ways and arguably not as well). Features the best work by performers outside the main cast, with Alfre Woodard and Alice Krige's being the #1 and #2 best guest spots in a Trek film. Plus Adam Scott shows up for like five seconds.
2. ***The Voyage Home*** \-- On previous viewings, I liked, but never loved, this one. I thought the humor went too far. But I really liked the lighter tone and fun of it all this time. Though others have remarked on it going back to the first reviews, I also really appreciated for the first time how this film manages to create tension and stakes in spite of there being no villain.
3. ***The Undiscovered Country*** \-- A good, old fashioned political thriller / mystery story. Engaging, well-structured and fun. Christopher Plummer is having a great time chewing the scenery and quoting Shakespeare. A fitting send-off for the original cast.
4. ***The Wrath of Khan*** \-- This one fell lower in the rankings than I expected, though it's still quite good. On this rewatch, I was surprised at how cheaply made it feels, even by the standards of the time (and, indeed, it was). It tries and mostly succeeds at tackling big themes, but comes off more depressing and on one note than I remembered. Still, Khan is a great villain and the nebula battle / Genesis countdown / death of Spock sequence really holds up. Also has the best score of any film in the franchise.
5. ***Star Trek Beyond*** \-- The only one of the Kelvin timeline films that feels even remotely like Star Trek, and the only one that doesn't feel like a relentless assault on the senses. A fun, well-made popcorn flick.
6. ***The Motion Picture*** \-- Feels the most dated of any of the films (it is the oldest, after all) and could have used a polish on the script. But a true Star Trek story about pushing the boundaries of human experience. I watched the new 4K version of the Director's Cut, which is a substantial improvement in pacing and visual quality over the theatrical and earlier home media releases. Raises questions about what the franchise would have been if it had embraced this more stately, epic, 2001-esque style of this film.
7. ***The Final Frontier*** \-- Most people think this is the worst film of the franchise, or at least the worst with the original cast. It's certainly the most inconsequential with a silly plot and laughably bad special effects. Mediocre, but at least the cast look like they're having fun and somehow the movie managed to entertain me. Maybe I have a soft spot for campfire singalongs.
8. ***The Search for Spock*** \-- An even more somber tone than *TWoK* but without any of that film's redeeming qualities. Never quite hits its stride. Fell flat for me on this viewing in spite of many moments that should be affecting.
9. ***Generations*** \-- Picard is a wreck after a family tragedy. Data gets his emotion chip. Destruction of the *Enterprise*. The death of Kirk. But somehow the movie feels like less than the sum of these parts. Overall impression: it's trying too hard.
10. ***Insurrection*** \-- It does tell a Star Trek-y morality story. And the characters act consistently with their established characterizations, more so than in any of the other TNG films. But the stakes never feel high enough. The premise could have sustained a single episode, but not a film. Not offensive, but a forgettable snoozer.
11. ***Nemesis*** \-- It's interesting how this movie anticipates the worst trends in many different franchise reboots and revivals that will follow it. Plot points lifted from prior (and better) entries. Characters who behave in ways that conflict with their established characterizations (what's up, reckless dune buggy Picard?). Predictable, generally dour in tone and adds insult to injury with the death of a fascinating and beloved character.
12. ***Star Trek (2009)*** \-- Embodies everything we've come to know and dislike about JJ Abrams as a franchise filmmaker, and all the worst things about the recent incarnations of the Trek franchise. Add to that tons of ludicrous plot points and vertiginous, impossible to follow action sequences. For some reason everyone behaves like they're idiots. Completely misses (or more likely dismisses) the point of Star Trek and fails to substitute anything coherent in its place. Almost unwatchably bad.
13. ***Star Trek Into Darkness*** \-- Combines (and amplifies) all the things I dislike about *Nemesis* and *Star Trek (2009)*, except this time everyone behaves like *hateful* idiots. Seriously: why is every character -- including the heroes -- unnecessarily rude, obstinate, deceitful or sullen? This film and its predecessor make me despise every member of the main cast, all of whom I like, or even adore, in other things (except Anton Yelchin and Bruce Greenwood, who can't help but be endearing). The pits. I rewatched and ranked all 13 Trek movies"
startrek,"Okay, so look. I know how this is going to sound and I know what you're going to think I am. But this isn't that. I'm not one of those fans that's hyper obsessed with canon and thinks new Trek is somehow ""too woke"" (whatever that even means) or anything like that. I'm just a Trek fan. But *boy* am I at about my limit with these new shows. 

To this point, I've resisted criticizing Kurtzman Trek because it's young. Trek is a franchise that's always needed time to find its footing every time out. No one ever quite nails it right out of the gate. So I let it slide. I partook in the ""maybe next season they'll figure it out"" cycle. But I think it's finally time to just call this for what it is. 

The new crop of Trek writers are incapable of creating new, meaningful, relevant stories that have any point whatsoever. They all just meander and act like they have some deep insight about society but it never goes beyond ""things sometimes bad."" It's all hollow. It's a scam. 

I have never seen a franchise so dependent on fan service as this. They somehow both want to pretend like they're brave enough to buck canon while simultaneously relying on cheap flashes of it to keep viewers engaged. Every episode resorts to using some cheap musical cue for nostalgia or is some play on an iconic plotline or has some funny spin on classic dialogue. They have not managed to create a single lasting pop culture moment since their era of television began. 

For as big a budget as they give these shows, they have this kind of cheapness about them. And it's been bothering me trying to figure out what it is. But it's absolutely the writing. Characters just talk and talk and it's never about anything. It never even feels like real people talking. 

Nothing about these shows has felt like a real, tangible future that we can someday get to because it's all just window dressing for a sci-fi action show. They have no interest in fleshing out this future world and society and how people act in it. Every character from this new era, with maybe one or two exceptions, feels like a human being from today. It's *so* weird. 

It's like they forgot the point of making a show like Star Trek and are just going through the motions. It's weird to say but there's no sense of space in these shows. I've never gotten that sense that there's this great big universe out there with all these civilizations doing their own things and that they all matter. It somehow feels more planet-of-the-week than Trek ever has without even capturing the charm of that format. 

The visual language of the show is a hot mess. Things exist in this universe because they look cool. There's never any rhyme or reason to what technology they have because they don't want to think about it for more than 5 minutes. It creates this almost fantasy-like quality that totally removes that desire to attain a future like they're presenting. Everything is all dark and shiny and holographic and weirdly angular and it just looks messy. 

It all just looks really, really bleak right now. I can't imagine that these's some switch they flip and suddenly it all gets better. The writing pedigree of these people does not inspire tremendous confidence. I think more than anything, I just want them to know that. I want them to know that I was that fan that was onboard with a new, bold take on Trek and that they have utterly failed me. There's nothing brave about what they're doing. It's cheap and hollow and I'm done with it.

startrek,"1.  The line by Borgati said ""There are two Renees, one who lives and another who dies.""  -- Laris can shapeshift, she will be the other Renee, Soong will kill her thinking it's the Real renee.

2.  Q is going to sacrifice himself, in some way to save the future.  His last words to Picard will be, or his last bit of power to send them back to the future: ""Je t'aime mon Capitan, Au Revoir"" (I love you, my captain, goodbye."") in French

3.  They will go back to before the self-destruct and Picard will not activate it.

4.  Borg will join Starfleet, and Seven will too. (ALA Star Trek Online)

5.  There is going to be a HUGE cameo at the end.  This is highly possible as Season 2 and 3 were filmed back to back.  Setting up for the next season. I am also saying a huge cameo, in both SHIP and PERSON.

6.  Rios is going to stay in the past with Thresa (As hinted when she said ""How do you know your future is not here?""

The finale is going to include everyone: Including Wells, Guinan, and Not-Soji. Some theories I have for the finale episode of Picard. Please join in if you wish. (spoilers)"
startrek,"Now that the cat's out of the bag, and we all know that the new type of Borg Queen we saw in Picard S2 is actually Jurati + the Confederation Borg Queen, who learned that *their* resistance against Federation is futile, and it is them that needs to change strategies.

A show about the Legion wandering in the Delta Quadrant building their collective over 400 years would actually be quite interesting.

Before you think that a Borg redemption arc is stupid, hear me out.

Trek had rarely explored what a hivemind really is, except episodes like Unimatrix Zero, in which we saw how some individual minds in the Collective could still communicate through dreams. Picard S2 has been interesting in that aspect in the way that we could see how it actually works in the struggle between Jurati and the Queen.

Imagine in the beginning it's just Jurati and the old Queen on La Sirena trying to flesh out who they should assimilate. They will be truly bootstrapped like Voyager, except it's an army of one instead of a crew complement of 152. They cannot assimilate in mass anymore, but instead, each new recruit needs to be vetted. And as the collective grows, each of them would still have their individuality, so they can all talk to each other, yet also access each others' skills and control each others' bodies.  
(Oh wait, I just described Sense8 in Voyager.)

As they don't have abundant power, they will need to carry out high stakes alien heists to get what they need. They may attempt to steal warp cores. Or salvage destroyed ships in the trail of the Borg. And they may attempt to assimilate a Doomsday Machine for power (which was what the designer of the Borg ship suggested). And of course they also need to hide under the radar from the Borg. They might even get captured by the Borg but they would manage to liberate a few drones from Unimatrix Zero.

(So I guess that is Sense8 in Voyager in the Matrix.)

We will also get to see empires being expanded over the decades and century - a traversal of time periods we had not seen in the Trek series. The writers can do as many time skips as they like. Each season can be an entirely new time period. The crew may be able to observe early Federation from afar (and may even be able to assist old Archer). And they can travel across timelines and escape from time cops. We can also see what it's like to have a crew of one, a crew of 8, a crew of hundreds, to a collective of thousands, and millions. A show or a novel about the Legion would actually be quite cool."
startrek,Does Starfleet have a way to commission other than the four-year university program at the Academy? Do they have something akin to Officer Candidate School or Direct Commissioning Program that modern uniformed services have for people who study elsewhere but want to commission after their college? Starfleet Officer Candidate School?
startrek,"Jean-Luc Picard has been through more mental stress in his lifetime than I can fathom. He has traveled time repeatedly, lived an entire lifetime as another person, lived in a time loop (for a few weeks if I recall correctly), jumped between time periods at an increasingly frantic rate, been trapped inside a holodeck without realizing it, been reverted to a child, re-lived his 20's, merged with a collective consciousness (then un-merged), and I'm sure I'm missing other things.

After all of that, the mind would be so fractured and your sense of self and reality so damaged, I'm surprised he can even put on pants. How Is Picard Not Insane?"
startrek,"I grew up on Star Wars. The only Star Trek related thing I saw until 2009 was Galaxy Quest (I know not officially Star Trek but I did my research on how you all love it.) Then the Kelvin timeline crew became my first introduction to the franchise and I saw all of those in theaters. That was about the extent of it because after all, I grew on Star Wars. Admittedly I didn't start watching anything else until late 2021 after rewatching JJ's stuff again. Suddenly I wanted to know more about Kirk and Spock. The idea of Starfleet intrigued me. 

I decided to go in chronological order starting with ENT and ending with VOY (including all movies). My goal was to finish before SNW drops. Wow. What an incredible experience. I've been seeing other people on this sub mention them going through everything for the first and couldn't wait to share my experience. I learned a few things. First, ENT is awesome. I wish they would have had 7 seasons, it was just getting good and I loved the idea of the first Captain figuring things out as he went along. Second, I didn't think I'd like TNG because I genuinely loved the classic Kirk/Spock dynamic but TNG ended up being one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. DS9 was ahead of its time and had some of the best episodes of the franchise IMO. VOY had the coolest premise and I connected emotionally with the simple story of just trying to make it home. 

Despite all of that my favorite crew is still the Kelvin Enterpise crew. It's hard to forget your first contact. But as for favorite show it's between TNG and ENT. I say ENT because it was the first show I started and the theme song really slapped. Currently I catching up on Picard before Season 3 and then I need to finish seasons 3 and 4 of DISCO. Fan for life. I'm just really sorry I waited so long to be assimilated 😉

Thanks if you've read this far. I think this is one of my first posts on Reddit. Hope I did it right. 

TLDR: Resistance is futile. Watch Star Trek or be destroyed. Decided to watch everything in chronological for my first time experiencing the franchise as a whole. Fav crew: Kelvin Enterpise (twas my first contact). Fav show: TNG or ENT. *Bonus* fav movie: toss up between TMP Directors Cut, First Contact or Star Trek 2009. Can't believe I held out for so long."
startrek,"The original broadcast of ""The Measure of a Man"" was 44 minutes, like all TV of the era, with space for 16 minutes of commercials.

Sometime later, an ""extended edition"" of the episode was found in the possession of writer Melissa Snodgrass, which was later released in 2012 (including on Blu-ray). This version is 57 minutes long; 13 more minutes than the broadcast cut.

What I'm wondering is -- why does this even exist? It's not unusual to film a little extra for TV and then trim for time, but 13 whole minutes? Entire additional scenes exist in the EE that are not in the broadcast version. TV is expensive, and TNG was an exceptionally expensive show, so why would the creators even make this thing?

The only thing I can think of is that it was intended to be ""a very special episode"" of TNG and be broadcast over a 90 minute timeslot (which would seem appropriate for a 57 minute episode) -  but for some reason that didn't pan out so they had to cut it down to the standard 44 minutes. But I haven't seen any source to back this up; it's pure speculation on my part.

If you haven't seen the EE of this episode, do seek it out. It makes a great episode even greater, in my opinion. Why does there exist an extended edition of TNG 2.09 ""The Measure of a Man""?"
startrek,"Jurati joining with the Queen and becoming ""something new"" is so much like that ending. Anyone else get Motion Picture vibes from the latest Picard episode?"
startrek,"Throughout exploration(at least in TOS and TNG), the Federation took initiatives to terraform otherwise lifeless worlds in to Class M habitats.  The Prime Directive is supposed to regulate noninterference into other cultures and lifeforms.  It seems humanoid-centric to think that only sentient life can be interfered with.  Shouldn't the Prime Directive be extended to include non-interference of the natural state of planetary habitats?  Thank you. Does Terraforming Violate the Prime Directive?"
startrek,"https://twitter.com/AventineIss/status/1519714026736930816

startrek,"But would the series look better to me, all this time later? I doubt it.

I never liked Kate Mulgrew. There was, and is, something about her persona, and even her voice, that just sets my teeth on edge. It's hard to give a show a chance, if you don't like the lead actor or actress. In contrast, I liked *everyone* on DS9. 

I thought the characters were photocopies of photocopies. Thin little characters punched out of a slot, with stock ""features"" to make each one seem different. Compared to *Voyager*, even the animated characters on *Lower Decks* are dazzling in their complexity. In comparison, nearly everyone on TNG and DS9 were developed in interesting ways.

I thought the show kept introducing interesting ideas, then almost immediately dropping them. A Starfleet crew forced to team up with a rebelling faction, in order to survive and get home? Cool! Then two episodes later they're all getting along jolly fine. I can't recall more examples, but it seemed like I remember a lot of ""Hey, how about...? Naah, forget that...""

(At some point I heard that Janeway and Tom Paris briefly turned into giant sea-slugs and mated, and I just sighed. All they needed to add was Jonathan Harris as Zachary Smith.) I Never Liked Voyager."
startrek,Obviously you guys and girls are getting the pilot next week but any idea on how uk people are seeing it yet? Strange New Worlds Uk Date ?
startrek,"Im watching it in chronological order. I loved enterprise, reminded me of the star gate series. T'pol was my favorite.. lol. Loved archer.. trip.. all of then.  Great way to dive into the  star trek universe.  (I'm 33) so I've been aware of star trek for along time. Thought it was  boring when I was younger in my teens. Anyways I watched discovery seasons 1 and 2 and couple of episodes in season 3. It came off really ""woke"" at first.. all of a sudden everyone's gay.. lol what ever if you agree it's woke or not.. it does have that vibe to it..I still enjoyed it and want to finish season 3 and 4 and not go in chronological order.. the original series was harder for me to get into.. especially the first episode.. but the remastered rendering is amazing it looks like it was a camera from 2022 that filmed it.. I got halfway through season 1 when I had to try out some star trek tge next Gen. Now I'm halfway through that first season.. i guess it doesn't matter the order I go in.. I cant wait for the other series.. I love star trek so much now. I used to think of star trek fans as nerds lol I always pictured them in cosplay and anti social and weird people.. but that was wrong syar treks awesome and I could see how anyone would like it.. I love star trek! Can't believe I waited so long to watch it"
startrek,"There have been a few books and comics written about this already, but I would dig a Trek series about Khan and crew set in the period between being left by Kirk in TOS and being rediscovered in TWOK.

I'm not sure if any have seen it, but I imagine something kind of like ""Raised By Wolves"" (a pretty cool scifi show about a group of people trying to settle a dangerous alien world).

There could also be flashback of Khan and his crew on earth and the events leading up to the Eugenics Wars and having flee.

There's just 1 question: who would you cast as Khan? I would dig a Ceti Alpha V limited series"
startrek,"Okay, what is the point of it at all? We are almost over S2, and if you would have seen the whole season with these scenes cut out you would have lost zero extra context regarding anything else. This would be still okay if it would provide valid, important and needed characterization, but I think it's not the case. I mean the connection for Picard being a loner/etc and the things that has happened in the scenes seems very forced. Not to mention it feels to me that the characterization we received during TNG actually contradicts some things here. [SPOILER PIC 2x09] The meaning of the Picard childhood subplot in PIC S2"
startrek,"Does it get any better?  


I wanted to like this show. I just got access to it and to be honest I have despised the fan boys I hear laying into this show using sexist, racist and other crappy bigotries. I have hated the haters long before I had the ability to watch Discovery.   


Problem is I don't feel like I am watching Star Trek. The only episode in the entire season that felt like I was watching proper star trek was the one with the time loop and that was a fantastic episode. I think it might be the Klingon plot that bugs me. Regardless of how I feel about the changes all the actors look uncomfortable and have obvious trouble talking. Like they're under so much makeup the actors look miserable, and it comes across.  


I just needed to get this off my chest.  I spent years wanting to really like this show I am going to continue but I am not enjoying this like Picard, Lower Decks or Prodigy. Long time fan just watched Discovery season one and i have a question."
startrek,"In this episode, when Dr. Bashir was talking with Major Kira, he told her that the Yalosians cannot see the red/orange part of the color spectrum. That got me to wondering about the Bajorans who wear the red/orange uniforms…          
Would the Yalosians just see a bunch of floating heads walking around the station?? DS9 (S3E20) “Improbable Cause”"

startrek,Why couldn't Data's conciousness have been uploaded to a holo-program? They already have the tech that allows holograms to leave the holodeck with an arm band. Then it could be programmed to update in age and Brent Spiner could play Data as long as he wanted. Why couldn't Data have become a hologram?
startrek,"1. Which single moment in STD makes you think the franchise doomed?
2. Which single moment in STD makes you think the franchise is worth sticking with?

For me it's two moments in Season 2 Episode 2 - New Eden 

Doomed Moment: Tilly being a complete moron acting like a teenager with the sudden appearance of an imaginary friend.

Saving Moment:  Captain Pike is explaining to a man in the basement who and where he's from and then seeing video of the Red Angel in the church - on the surface it's a retelling of the Voyagers 37s episode but, the appearance of the Red Angel actually makes me actually want to see the next episode: To enjoy the story and NOT just to witness a slow-motion car crash.

Thoughts? Which ONE Star Trek Discovery moment?"
startrek,"I've heard Rokeg Blood Pie mentioned on a few different episodes. Apparently, it was one of Worf's favorite foods as a child. And I've found lots of interesting recipes with which to make an earthbound facsimile of it (some sweet, some savory).

But what is a Rokeg? If it has blood, I would assume it is an animal, but we have ""blood oranges"" that are just red fruits, so it could be just about anything... What is a Rokeg?"
startrek,"Now that Queen Jurati has peaced out with the Confederation La Sirena, Picard &amp; Friends are stuck in 2024 without a ride back to the 25th century. So, how are they going to get back?

Speculation!

**1. The game never truly ends, Mon Capitaine -** Once Picard sorts out whatever's got Q going through the big sad and gets the timeline back on track, Q snaps his fingers and everyone is back where they belong. Except, y'know, Jurati is off forming a new Borg Cooperative, and Elnor is now a hologram.

**2. Who Watches the Time Travellers? -** Much like she's got Romulan disruptors, padds, and neural stimulators stashed away, Tallinn has a Romluan time travel device collecting dust in her apartment. 

**3. Once More Around the Sun -** in the process of making sure the Europa Mission launches, the Picard &amp; Friends stow away on the Shango and take a slight detour around the Sun. Seven, now Borged up again, no longer has any excuse why she can't do the time travel math. Afterwards they wipe the astronaut's memory and put them back where they're supposed to be.

**4. Sir, Do You Know What Time Period You're In -** Now that the timeline has been restored, Agent Wells' descendant, Captain Ducane of the USS Relativity shows up to collect Team Picard before they can make a real mess of things.

**5. Took You Long Enough -** Picard and company hangout in 2024 until the Bell Riots and the USS Defiant is able to locate Sisko, Dax, and Bashir to rescue them. Tallinn piggybacks on the transporter signal, and the Picardies stow away until they get to 2371, at which point they're able to find a way to return to 2401.

startrek,"not much to elaborate on. It just occurred to me and I didn’t think to ask anyone about it. When I was in high school, the teacher said that Gene Roddenberry had a computer with programs written in a code he invented and we hadn’t deciphered yet. Has anything changed?"
startrek,"It’s the 24th century and she was treated like someone would be with mental illness in the early 1900s. It seemed his father made the situation worse and saw her mental illness as a means to control her. The whole storyline made me uncomfortable, especially the way they portrayed mental illness through his mother. In addition episode 9 made me upset. The S2 storyline of Picard’s mother really bothered me"
startrek,Is Star Trek Picard going to utilize a Deus ex machine to drive the ending to the plot.  That would suck.  It’s also considered by some to be lazy writing.   What do you think ? Deus ex machina
startrek,"I'm watching every series in production order, and after having recently finished DS9 I'm just cracking Voyager.

I'm having an issue with Voyager of sorts, and that's in the fact that the Delta Quadrant is so radically different and uncharted. Every species is new, so many unfamiliar technologies. I had a moment when the Voyager made first contact with Neelix where I thought ""how are their hailing technologies even compatible?""

The more I think about it, I guess this would also be a consideration for contacting new species in the alpha and beta quadrants, and in DS9 the heroes were able to interface with Dominion technology. I really appreciated in DS9 how they showed the crew learning how to operate a Jem'Hadar ship and not being very good at it at first.

I know, it's Star Trek. It's sci-fi with a fantastical element. Not everything needs a logical explanation. But the Voyager seems pretty well prepared to interact with an entirely foreign environment 70k light years from Federation space. The civilizations of the Delta Quadrant surely developed their technologies entirely independently of the alpha/beta quadrants, so I guess I'm just fixated on that. Starting Voyager - having trouble suspending disbelief"
startrek,"I don’t care what people have to say about Kurtzman, “nu Trek” or whatever else, season 2 of Picard is the best Trek I’ve seen ever since the end of DS9 and this week’s episode ranks among my top 10 episodes of Star Trek period. If the current showrunners of Picard stay involved in Star Trek then Trek has a bright, bright future ahead Ignore the hate, Star Trek Picard season 2 is good Star Trek"
startrek,"They say the cast is reuniting as if all of their characters are returning. Yet we know Data's ""consciousness"" was erased. So do you think they'll try to bring back B4 or Lore they were part of the original TNG cast? Or do you think they'll just do another Soong such as they did Altan in present day, or currently Adam in this past timeline? Or a new Soong altogether?

Also Speculation on Worf? If Dorn is back and we know Worf left Starfleet and is or was on the high council in lit reasons that the Klingon Empire will be appearing in S3. Martok too maybe? So with the announcement of the TNG cast reuniting for Picard S3, we all know that includes Brent Spiner again. So, my question is, who do you think he'll be playing?"
startrek,"Jean-Luc Picard is a very knowledgeable person, to say the least. As the captain of Starfleet's flagship, he has access to all types of information, public and classified.  He also has a passion for history and is an amateur archeologist.  He mentions what happened to his family during WWII and Chateau Picard.  How does he not know about Renee Picard?  I mean it is not like she is some random person in history.  She is supposed to lead a mission to another planet's moon...that is pretty significant for 2024.   


It just seems implausible that Jean-Luc wouldn't be familiar with any of this history. Why doesn't Jean-Luc Picard know anything about Renee Picard and the Europa mission?"
startrek,"Mine was the meeting between Sisko and Picard in DS9 S01E01 Emissary.

Sisko lost his wife in the battle of Wolf 359 of which Locutus was involved. So he wasn't a fan of Picard.

For me, Picard was held on a pedestal throughout the galaxy - including in my eyes. Now for someone to hate him, which also made me realise a lot of other people would hate him, was confronting.

Picard is clearly upset with the challenge from Sisko but his professionalism kicks in when he orders Sisko to stop being a bitch and to do his job.

This wasn't the first time Picard had been confronted by someone through Locutus' actions at Wolf 359. It won't be the last. [Potential Spoilers] What is your favourite Star Trek scene of any franchise?"
startrek,"Maybe someone more knowledgeable about all the different alien species can help me out. Besides Ferengi, Orions, Yridians and Nausicaans what other alien races are commonly thieves, rogues, mercenaries for hire or otherwise part of the criminal underworld in the Star Trek universe?  I’m looking for non-Federation races that would have a presence in the alpha and/or beta quadrant and are not a major military power in their own right like the Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, etc. Criminals and rogues of the STU"

startrek,"As per https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/error#Appearances

This obviously isn't a completely fair comparison, since TNG features a number of holodeck episodes essentially set on Earth, but I think it's still pretty striking. The TNG showrunners clearly were invested in expanding boundaries of the Trek universe and showing new and unique locales, whereas PIC has been far more content to tread familiar ground and established locations. I think it's disappointing that rather than ""boldly going"", the show opts to stick with Earth for so much of its runtime.

As an addendum, both VOY and DS9 also had more appearances of Earth than TNG, despite both shows being premised on their distance from Earth. ENT also had more appearances in 4 seasons, although in that case I think it makes a bit more sense since the premise of the show meant the ship was somewhat more tethered to Earth. Fun fact: PIC already has had more episodes set on Earth than the entirety of TNG"

startrek,"Watching a convention panel with Gates McFadden and Nina Visitor and the topic of pregnancy comes up: [link to part of video with that discussion](https://youtu.be/nag9fejLSpY?t=2234) (37:14) The discussion leading up to it are pretty good too, as she talks about how she sought to defy tropes about women in the way she performed Kira.

Nina mentions how she was scared she'd lose her job on the show for being pregnant, Gates is fully understanding and nodding so I looked it up and according to wikipedia she was pregnant during TNG but it was hidden: ""Her pregnancy was not written into the fourth season of TNG; instead, her character wore a laboratory coat over her uniform to conceal it."" I had no idea.

But my next admission is a little embarrassing. I'm currently watching DS9 for the first time and my dumb ass was thinking the other day: ""man, they're really beating this pregnant-Kira storyline to death. How many episodes is this going to go on for?? I bet she's sick of wearing that silicone belly"". Oh dear. Nina Visitor and Gates McFadden discussing pregnancy in Star Trek"

startrek,"This is the episode where a gentleman named Fajo captures Data to be a plaything in his collection of rare acquisitions.  In order to force Data's cooperation, he is even wiling to kill his own people.  Right before Data's escape, Fajo taunts him to shoot him citing that he cannot due to Data being unable to cause harm to another living being.

There is a moment where Data clearly and concisely considers the proposition and then he says he must put a stop to this.  He pulls the trigger like a stone cold MFer and was definitely going to kill Fajo.  But right at that moment, Obrien beams him off Fajo's ship and is spared.  Obrien comments that there is a weapon in the transport that was discharged and that he is deactivating it.

Now, Data even said himself that although he cannot purposefully harm another living being, he is very capable of employing deadly force if it is in the defense of life.  So I understand exceptions can be made, and that he decided that offing Fajo would be deadly force employed in the preservation of life since Fajo clearly had no qualms about killing even those loyal to him.

But Obrien and Riker question him on this and this is what got me as I re-watched this today...  Data straight up lied and suggests that something must have occurred during transport.  Now that could be, but I damn well believe he pulled that trigger on purpose and then deflected this fact when he arrived on the Enterprise.

I love that this is something we were meant to debate with ourselves.  I love that this show had constantly dropped little hints that Data was slowly and inexorably becoming more and more human-like as he progressed and maybe he was always closer than we were led to believe, and maybe not.  But it was up to us to try and decide for ourselves. Damn Data, that's some stone cold $#!^... (The ending of TNG S03E22 - The Most Toys) (spoilers if you're going through TNG for the first time)"
startrek,"So I'm a new fan of Star Trek. Absolutely positively adore Star Trek, all of it! I haven't watched all of the series yet but I did complete TOS and TNG, and I'm on season 3 of Star Trek DS9. Every once in awhile I'll do some research on the internet and so far all I've come across about the romulans is that their homeworld is destroyed by a supernova, and then for some reason Mars is attacked where I'm guessing most romulans were resettled, unless I've got something backwards here? But what ultimately happens to the Romulans? Are they able to create an empire again? Or are they just scattered all over the Galaxy? Why does it seem like the writers of Star Trek want to completely obliterate the Romulans? I love the Romulans, and I hate the Star Trek seems to be against them for some reason?

startrek,"I was watching DS9 and there's a scene where Quark says ""humanoid"" with out the usual Ferengi ""hoo-man"" pronunciation.

So here's my theory- Maybe the word ""human"" sounds similar to a Ferengi word (Hu mahn?) that is crude, nasty, or insulting. So when Ferengi first heard the word ""human"" they got a giggle out of it, and call humans ""hoo-man"" as an inside joke. The Universal Translator thinks it's an accent and uses the word untranslated. Humanoid Not Hoo-manoid"

startrek,"I will admit Entreprise has become better in the second season than the first. Carbon Creek and Minefield come to mind. I watched Singularity last night and I liked the idea of the Triary star system with the black hole. The crew developing symptoms silimar to OCD, I wasn’t a fan of. I personally suffer from OCD myself, so I was very interested to see how they handled it. They didn’t explicitly mention OCD in the episode but it was obvious with them constantly redoing tasks and not being able to focus on anything else was meant to match it. Even the description of the episode on Wikipedia talked about them developing a silimar condition to it.

Well I appreciate it being a little more nuanced than other portrayals I’ve seen about OCD, beyond repeat hand washing and being tidy stereotypes, I still wasn’t a fan. OCD is so much than repeating something over and over, it’s about instrustive thoughts and not hyper focusing on a task. You do it to relieve anxiety. Anyway, I know it’s an episode from a cancelled T.V show from over 20 years but I was curious to know peoples thoughts on this episode Star Trek: Enterprise Season 2, Episode 9: Singularity and portrayal of OCD"
startrek,"I was watching “A Piece of the Action” and heard a particularly striking line of dialogue, ""The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man. And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to be co-operating."" Any other examples of great lines from episodes that aren’t considered to be in the pantheon of great trek drama episodes? Best Line from a Goofy/Fun Episode"
startrek,"Star Trek Enterprise was the best Star Trek series was the conclusion I came to. Here is why, and hear me out before you judge!

•It paid so much homage to TOS. From the sounds of the ship, to bringing up tribbles, to archer fighting like Kirk would, and obvious in a mirror darkly part 1&amp;2 in season 4.
•TNG didn’t get good until season 3. Neither did enterprise some say. But TNG got a fair shake, enterprise didn’t.
•Archers character arc. 
When the series first started, there were questions as to why a ship would even need weapons. Archer was a happy go lucky explorer in season 1, but by season 4, had become battle hardened, and had seen so much. We see a man get torn down, and the idea of exploration gets soured by constant threats.
 •Archers crew didn’t have the resources that future captains had. Going into the unknown, in the dark, was truly something in this show. There was no prime directive, no real guidelines, and little assistance if anything. Just look at season 3 with the expanse. There was little data for anything, not a lot of ships to even assist. NX-01 wasn’t a battle ship, but it sure as hell got treated like one. 
•The main cast as a whole was amazing. It worked extremely well.
•Archer had a different captain style. We saw the crew of enterprise get their asses kicked, but we also saw them succeed just as much. Archer did a damn good job as captain. Especially in season 4. He wasn’t so “official”. He had a more relaxed way of leading, and letting those on the crew do what they do best. Of course archer had to be tougher on occasion. But if I had to choose as my captain. It would either be Archer, or Kirk. 
•The show gave us answers to questions we had. Such as how the Vulcans came to be in the other show that take place later. Or why the Klingons looked more human like in TOS.
•There we’re episodes that threw what was right, or wrong in your face. If you’ve seen the “cogenitor” episode you know what I mean. Think about a time when there was no prime directive. How do they manage. Watch the “cogenitor” episode. 

I could go on! I love every Star Trek series, from TOS to Star Trek Picard(season 2 is better than 1). I don’t like discovery though. Not trying to offend discovery fans.

startrek,"Augmentation, eugenics, all in the future? No, it's happening right here right now, just not on an industrial scale.

Think of those prestigious schools that rich parents send their average kids to in order for them to succeed, and the parents to then bask in the reflected glory of their offspring's achievements. Of having the shame of a 'slow' child erased by money. 

Dating services today advertise for Tall, musically gifted, athletically built, mathematically inclined mates in order to have their 'perfect' child, which they hope will be better faster more intelligent and more predisposed to success and therefore richer than average. 

The writers may not have realised that what they were writing was close to the truth, or that people would draw their own conclusions about the story.

startrek,"What was that whole mini-arc in the show about Picard and Guinan being arrested?  
They spent almost a whole episode on that and then they just let them go??

This seems to be something that is popular with a lot of the streaming mini-series that are out/coming out.  They waste a ton of time on things that do not really contribute to the story.

Maybe if that FBI/CIA/NSA/whatever agent returns in a later episode and makes more trouble for them then it might be worthwhile, but I bet he doesn't.

&lt;/rant&gt; So what was that anyway?"

startrek,"It's so rare for me to anxiously await for show releases. I liked S1 but it just didn't give me the same fix that has drawn me to Star Trek for 30 some years now. It was smart to go so heavy bringing the old fam together. It was almost like they hand held me into a new format. I can dig a Star Trek movie every year 😂. Feel like this should have been S1 though. 

The aging issues where handled AWESOMELY! I know a lot of the cast when asked were concerned with that.  [J](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/de-lancie)ohn De Lancie had used it as a reason why it wouldn't make sense for him to come back. But flipping it into him basically mocking Picard was perfect. I don't even really like the whole travel to now story lines most of the time.

I like how it uses Timicin’s home planet requiring he be euthanized as a statement to how the younger generation treats people when they get older in the real world, but also  it has some incredible acting by Majel Barrett. Like seriously, her acting was so good that I couldn’t look away from the tv.

I like how they showed more of Lwaxana’s character though, hopefully we see more of her now that she’s more fleshed out. I still have 3 seasons to go! And yes I’m loving it so far. TNG: Half a life"

startrek,"We have seen him fight so many times, but we’ve only seen him use his abilities (while he was a changeling) when in a fight like only 3 times. Off the top of my head I can really think of is in the first episode where that thief dude throws the spike flail at him and it *goops* through his head and when he links/disrupts that other changeling trying to destroy the defiant. There’ve been more than a few times where I wanted to see him turn his fists into iron bars and knock out a couple Klingons or Jem’Hadar. I know it’s not really in his character, but things like that would’ve made him so much cooler than he already is. What do yall think? Odo not using his shapeshifting abilities defensively/offensively."

What if there was a Star Trek show for audiences younger then prodigy?"
startrek,"The mirror universe episodes have always bothered me because for the same people to exist during TOS, DS9, Enterprise and Discovery they would have to have an identical evolution. The chances of evil versions of characters existing at a given point is one thing, but for that to continue to perpetuate through time is a ridiculous notion to happen naturally. This has always made it difficult to suspend disbelief for these episodes. The conditions and timing necessary for a couple to meet and produce offspring that are identical, yet evil versions of themselves in each iteration are impossible.       
This has perplexed me for too long so I finally had an idea. What if the mirror universe isn't an alternate universe, what if it is a simulation that is activated and spins up a mirror version of you everytime you enter it?        
If we assume that we live in a simulated universe then of it more believable that our consciousness can be transferred to another simulated universe or to another real one that makes zero sense?     
I rather like this idea. I think it's more grounded and makes more sense. I think it would be cool to have an episode explore this idea. The mirror universe paradox and a possible explanation"

I found the it  wide i had to make sure I was looking at both sides of the TV not to miss anything. Watching Prodigy on Nickelodeon UK on TV.
startrek,"In ""Facets"" (DS9 S3 Ep. 25), Jadzia goes through her Zhian'tara ritual and speaks with the consciousness of previous hosts and learns that the reason Curzon was so hard on her was because he was in love with her. But if Jadzia had the same symbiote that was within Curzon, wouldn't she already know this? I thought she had the memories, knowledge, abilities, etc. of all previous hosts, so how would she not have known this? Am I misunderstanding something about the relationship between the symbiote and the host? A question about the Trill and the host/symbiote relationship."
startrek,"Shatner is somewhat disliked for his ego, but he never bullied anyone. By all accounts, Kate was an absolutely nasty person who made the whole cast uncomfortable in her treatment of Jeri, yet she seems to have been entirely forgiven by the fanbase.

Resistance is Futile

1. tlhIngan Hol only permits syllables to end in a single consonant, or in one of three consonant clusters, those being -w', -y', and -rgh. I figure ""borgh"" fit best, but if you speak a non-rhotic accent (one where Rs after vowels aren't pronounced), then you might find ""boq"" fits better  

2. Technically, porghQeD is biology/anatomy, as in ""body science."" I thought perhaps ""porgh mIw,"" ""body function"" worked better in this context. SIr is a verb that means ""be unique"" that is acting as an adjective here. 

3. 'om - resist (ohm, hehe), -lu' - unspecified subject ('omlu' - someone resists), -ghach - nominalizer (hopefully, 'omlu'ghach would be ""resistance"". qey - futile/be in vain. The prefix for a 3rd person singular subject (resistance) without an object is no prefix (or a null prefix, rather), so technically an accurate translation might be like, ""Someone resisting is futile."" Could phrase it like *'omlu'DI' reH qey*, ""When someone resists, it is always futile."" 

Maybe they'd add one of the suffixes that mean they're sure of it or they think it's obvious, like *qey 'omlu'bejghach'* or *'omlu'Di' reH qeyba'*, ""Someone resisting is definitely futile,"" ""When someone resists, it is obviously futile."" I tried to translate the Borg hail to Klingon."

Has anyone seen any statements from interviews/trade press/etc about how Paramount execs judge success for The Ready Room?
I know the show is available at the very least on Paramount+, YouTube, and it looks like there are excepts on StarTrek.com


Does anyone have any insight into which (if any) of these media channels are viewed as more important internally, and might help the show be viewed as a success?  

For example, I could see an argument that it might help with user-engagement and ""virality"" metrics if their YouTube views were high, or it might be better to have an increased watch time inside the Paramount+ app.

And yes, I know that I'm overthinking and it doesn't really matter - It's all in good fun.
I just want the show to be viewed as a success and be assigned the best resources it can be going forward :) Does Paramount care where one watches The Ready Room?"

startrek," Watching the movies, series and reading some Star Trek comics, I realized that Starfleet and its members don't have the habit of using any kind of technology for personal flight, be it gravity boots, by air jets or otherwise.

With antigravity, flying is commonplace, we see its use even on hospital stretchers and I believe the use of these flight technologies would facilitate some missions, give more dynamics in hand-to-hand combat on land, it would be an added advantage.

startrek,"It would be set on a planet that's 90% Ocean, it would be like DS9 where they rarely leave the facility.

It would mostly take place in a federation science facility hundreds of miles beneath the Ocean, most of the characters would be Federation (&amp; ally) scientists studying the Flora, Fauna, and ancient alien ruins on the planet. There would be a Benzite city on the surface that they're constantly getting into property disputes with; There's an anti-federation terrorist cell amongst the Benzites and they would be a recurring antagonist.

Since the planet borders Klingon space, Alexander Rozhenko would occasionally appear as a Klingon 'diplomat' dent to ensure the Federation doesn't step on the Empire's toes with their operations.

There would be an ancient vault that they are trying to open, but it's millennia old and they don't want to destroy it, at some point there would be a plot twist where the discover it was made by the Ancient Humanoids who seeded all life in TNG and that this was their homeworld. The series finale would be them opening the Vault to discover an ancient computer library with millions of Terabytes of information left behind by the Ancients.

startrek,"The original subtitles aren't particularly accurate, but the remaster has brakes that are cut different lengths so you can't just use the subtitles from one on the other.

I've made super accurate subtitles for several other fandoms, and I can usually find someone else who's done the same before doing it myself.

Oh and the reason I watch the standard definition version is because when they did the remaster, they redid All the special effects and it fucks with the nostalgia. I also know there's a version out there from the Blu-ray where you could cut back and forth between the remastered video and the old special effects, I'm still working on tracking down a copy of that. has anybody taken the really good Blu-ray subtitles and synced them to the original release?"

startrek,"I feel like Discovery tried very much to take on trek and tell it in a different way that was experimental than the shows before. The first season visually and narratively took risks that I felt made it more interesting. A dysfunctional ship with different character archetypes really made it more interesting because you were invested in the relationship Michael had with others. When Lorca was founded out to be from the mirror universe and Saru was active captain the show became more vibrant as the ship became more functional. Building the world of old Trek in a newer way helped bring so much that I wondered how can they tell old concepts and play with it? Then season two came along and even built upon even more older concepts and played with it in newer ways such as bringing in Captain Pike which arguably was the best part of the season and having a concept of exploration in different parts of the universe that explained many different elements of the season long arc. But around season three the entire show for me took a left turn as the show went 1000 years into the future and basically in a broken galaxy where the federation was almost no more. The concept for the season was great but the character archetypes in place from the first season was flipped on its head. For example Saru became this incompetent captain when we have seen before he was able to navigate through a totalitarian universe. Tilly became a new first in command after she has been shown to be someone who had issues with her own self esteem and was on a journey from being a cadet to this. Then other characters such as culber, staments, and even the support bridge cast members were all trying to be this sort of traditional trek in a t.v landscape where it barely survived. The show really seemed like it was trying to please the nay sayers who claimed this wasn't trek even though this show to me didn't need to be traditional  trek in order to be good. Around the fourth season the show had another interesting concept of dealing with a force that wasn't understood until the end of the season but even still the character archetypes that was flipped on its head in the third season didn't help much and the season felt more dragged out even though it was shorter than the first two seasons. The show in the later half feels like its being more so like a traditional trek show with a story structure that won't allow it. 

I feel as if trying to tell old concepts, in a new landscape, while presenting it in an old fashion way is making Discovery for me less interesting, and to top it off taking out the character archetypes that made the show interesting even makes it less fruitful and genuine than it was before. Even though we aren't in the old episodic days of 90s trek one thing is for certain with all trek shows is that the characters make is worthwhile. TNG wouldn't be TNG without the drama story lines with is characters, Voyager became more interesting when Seven of Nine came on and her relation to the crew made them more interesting. The characters in ENT became more 3D when they were forced to be put to the test that challenged the traditional trek formula. In this new streaming landscaping it is vital to try and make each season as experimental as it can possible be. I don't want NuTrek to resemble old trek I want it be more as there is freedom now to do more with it. I think Discovery's First Two Seasons Was Its Best"
startrek,"To me, “Waltz” is a great episode that shows how power can really bring out the worst in people. In this case, Gul Dukat and his power-complex.

Dukat was put in a power through a corrupt, evil system to order to control a group of people (the Bajorans). He was desperate for their approval and tried to make a bad situation better (gilding a cage). Thinking of himself as a god-like figure with the Bajorans interests at heart, Dukat was convinced he was doing them a favor. He craved their praise and respect. Instead, the Bajorans spat in his face and he couldn’t understand why. Because of this, Dukat began to secretly loathe the Bajorans, but could never come to terms with this hate. 

Dukat would bottle these feelings for years while still convincing himself he was in the right. He hoped one day he would come across someone that would approve of him. After regaining and losing control of the Bajorans for a second time, as well as his daughter, Dukat had to face his demons (literally) in “Waltz”. 

While both marooned, Dukat pleaded for Sisko, a non-corrupt individual in a position of power that is worshipped by the Bajorans, for his input on him. He was desperate for Sisko’s approval, despite being allied with the Dominion and his past actions, to the point of holding Sisko hostage. When Sisko finally allowed him to present his case, Dukat admitted he believed the Bajorans were confused ingrates he grew to hate. Doing so, Dukat finally realized no one who opposed him would ever respect him. He escapes with the intentions of “destroying Bajor”, coming to terms with his demons and solidifying Sisko’s judgement that Dukat was truly evil.

Overall, Dukat’s ego and actions are not unlike corrupt politicians, authority figures, or even that one manager you had when you worked at the local grocery store. Someone who believes they have your interests at heart, but will go as far as literally destroying you if you don’t approve. That’s what a power-complex can do to someone. 

Curious if anyone else here felt this way or has similar/dissimilar thoughts when watching “Waltz”! DS9’s “Waltz” on having a power-complex"

startrek,"I was thinking about this on my walk from the gym and I was thinking how would you pitch another Star Trek show set in another galaxy. I know it may sound like a terrible idea, but you could explore the Andromeda Galaxy with the Kelvan Empire (despite the fact that the place will die in 10,000 years supposedly from radiation, but only for their species) and what if the Empire finally collapsed. You could tie in the Iconians somehow with other things. You could also make it a New Frontier-style show with Calhoun dealing with the destruction and fall of an empire and they go around exploring the aftermath of it, and maybe that's how you finally make him canon. I'm just spitballing here, but I'm curious on how other people who set this up. You can tie in a lot of unresolved cliffhangers from all of Trek, such as the Planet Killers, V'Yger, the aliens from Schisms, the whale probe and so much more. How would you pitch a Star Trek show set in another galaxy?"
startrek,"I just finished the first ""Picard"" novel, ""The Last Best Hope"" and...thought it was pretty great, actually. Great enough that I thought I would write a ""book report"" summarizing the things I learned. This is just a summary of things I found insightful or interesting, and I highly recommend reading the entire thing to see what I left out.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Romulan Supernova**

The thing I'm most grateful for is the way the novel was able to emphasize the sheer scope of the disaster, and the subsequent evacuations. Starfleet first becomes aware that the Romulan star is going to explode in 2381, six years before it happens. At that time, they estimate that the radius of the blast will be 9.7 light-years. In time, they refine their modeling, and realize that the supernova will expand much more quickly than they had realized, and the blast radius will be far larger, affecting far more worlds than orginally anticipated (more on this later).

It's suggested more than once in the novel that the supernova is unnatural, and may have been manufactured or caused deliberately, perhaps in an attack, but no significant progress is made toward uncovering who or what may have caused it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Mission**

The Romulan government is extremely reluctant to accept Starfleet's help - this is generally attributed to the secrecy of Romulan culture, and a desire to save face amongst the Romulan officials. Initially, they agree to allow Starfleet access to some of their outlying systems (that are within the blast radius) to relocate the inhabitants to safe worlds in Romulan space. Access to the core Romulan worlds is flatly denied. Even this relatively small-scale operation is estimated to involve the relocation of 900 million Romulans, and require thousands of ships, personnel, and ground infrastructure to resettle the refugees. It will become Starfleet's core mission for at least the better part of a decade, and virtually all exploration grinds to a halt as ships and resources are diverted to the evacuation efforts.

And that's all before the revised modeling reveals that the radius will be larger than they had realized, and that worlds they had previously regarded as safe destinations also need to be evacuated.

Overall, the book emphasizes the magnitude of the operation very effectively. This evacuation is now Starfleet's primary mission. Civilian researchers like Bruce Maddox are pulled from their careers and re-deployed to assist. It's truly an all-encompassing endeavour.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jean-Luc Picard**

Picard is hand-picked by Starfleet and promoted to lead this mission - however, one of the conditions is that he must do it without the *Enterprise,* as the Starfleet flagship wouldn't exactly be a welcome sight from a Romulan point of view. Picard hand-picks Worf to replace him as captain of the Enterprise, arguing against Kirsten Clancy's objections - she was citing Worf's actions in ""Change of Heart"", and Picard argues that his record since then has been spotless. Picard never returns to the *Enterprise*, and his belongings are shipped to him.

Obviously, Picard is the primary focus of the novel, and he's consistently portrayed as driven to save as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible. He devotes everything he has to his mission, and is completely unconcerned with the politics of what he's trying to achieve. This comes to a head when the revised modelling comes out, and Picard makes the decision to transport some refugees across the Neutral Zone to a Federation world that's willing to take them in, essentially unilaterally destroying the Neutral Zone.

His single-mindedness is his greatest virtue in the novel, and it's probably his greatest flaw as well, as he is ultimately blindsided by the changing political climate in Federation space, choosing instead to focus on his mission.

&amp;#x200B;

**Geordi La Forge**

As the only member of the *Enterprise* crew requisitioned by Picard for the mission, Geordi is a relatively minor character. He's placed in charge of the shipbuilding operations on Utopia Planitia. For the most part, we see him dealing with the resentment of people who have been pulled away from their careers to build the refugee ships, get them on-board with the mission and sort out the many, many logistical problems. The most significant issue is labour, which is eventually solved when Geordi contacts Bruce Maddox.

When the attack on Mars eventually happens, Geordi is on a shuttle en route to Earth, so he's safe (albeit dealing with significant survivor's guilt).

&amp;#x200B;

**Raffi Musiker**

When we meet her, Raffi is a Starfleet intelligence specialist in Romulan Affairs. She provides Picard with a briefing, and he's impressed by her frankness and honesty, in addition to her expertise on the Romulans. He quickly invites her to be his First Officer aboard his new ship, the *Verity*. As Raffi spends the next several years continuously aboard the *Verity*, we see her relationship with her husband and son deteriorate, while at the same time she bears witness to the horrors of millions of Romulans living in despair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bruce Maddox**

Maddox is recruited by La Forge to solve the labour issues on Mars. Maddox is furious to be pulled away from his life's work, but really has no choice but to develop synthetic workers as requested. He resents every second of it, however, and when Jurati gives him the idea of fractal neuronic cloning, he begins to devote his time to that, neglecting the A500 synths (which are already in full production by that point, so the fact that he's pretty checked-out goes unnoticed). When the synths eventually ""revolt"", Maddox freaks out a bit, unable to say definitively what had happened. His program at the Daystrom Institute is shut down, he leaves Earth, and we know the rest. Maddox is a jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

**The A500 Synths**

Not too much to say here, other than that the book is extremely emphatic that the A500s are not sentient, and are not programmed to have the ability to gain sentience. Maddox has utter contempt for them, referring to them more than once as ""toys."" The biggest technological leap they exhibit is that they combine Maddox's existing android reasearch with bio-neural technology for the first time. This greatly improves the synths' ability to learn to complete tasks, but - and believe me when I say the book can't emphasize this enough - they are not sentient.

&amp;#x200B;

**Agnes Jurati**

Jurati is a medical doctor when she joins Maddox at the Daystrom Institute - she's there on some kind of secondment as part of an interdisciplinary program. She's extremely interested in Maddox's research, and...okay, their icky relationship is what it is at this point. Jurati mostly serves as a distraction for Maddox, encouraging him to keep working on his dream of sentient androids, and giving him the idea of fractal neuronic cloning. After the attack on Mars, Agnes declines to leave Earth with him, and he doesn't really stick around long enough for her to give a good explanation as to why.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kirsten Clancy**

Captain Clancy is brought on to the evacuation project even before Picard is - she portrayed as a somewhat steely personality, with an immaculate record. Her role ends up being coordinating with both Romulan officials and the Federation Council to shore up an maintain political support for the evacuations - all the stuff that Picard ignores. She has a somewhat different view of things - some would say cynical, others might say realistic - but she fully supports the mission throughout. However, she doesn't quite share the ""whatever it takes"" mentality as Picard - her view of the situation is quite different from his. She doesn't receive her own promotion to Admiral until the novel's post-script, said to be a couple of years after the attack on Mars and abandonment of the project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Olivia Quest**

A junior Council member from the world of Estelen, Quest is the novel's primary stand-in for the voice of dissastisfaction in the Federation. Estelen is a small Federation world near the Neutral Zone - by all accounts, it's a bit of an unremarkable backwater, and Quest feels pretty strongly that her world, and others like it, are suffering as a result of the evacuation operations. And to an extent, she's right - worlds like hers feel overlooked by the ""Big Four"" founding worlds at the best of times, and they are in fact losing out on planned equipment requisitions and infrastructure projects as resources are redeployed to support the evacuation. She's also an admittedly ambitious politician - she quickly makes a splash in the media and positions herself front-and-centre on committees pertaining to the evacuation project. It should be noted that she never actually comes out against the mission itself, though she does argue that its scope is too large to be sustainable. She also does not support seccession, and is somewhat aghast when other worlds are considering it. There is also one aspect of the evacuation project that she's incredibly enthusiastic about, as she can see a clear future benefit for her world - the A500 synths.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spock**

Spock is mentioned twice. Initially, Picard ponders having Spock speak to the Romulan Senate to urge them to cooperate with Starfleet, only to be reminded that the Romulan Senate doesn't exactly hold Spock in the same esteem that Picard does. Years later, Picard speaks to Spock, who had remained in Romulan space for as long as possible, but is finally taking his own people to safety. There's no mention of his eventual plan to collapse the supernova, which is unsurprising as it's still two years away at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vashti**

Vashti is the world settled by the Qowat Milat - a Federation world that welcomed the Romulan refugees with open arms, it is set up to be the single greatest success story of the evacuation. Picard relies heavily on the world to boost his own morale when things get difficult, and it also serves as a valuable propaganda tool, as a model of Federation and Romulan citizens coexisting peacefully. The novel ends before things take a turn for the worse on Vashti, but the novel really contextualizes Picard's anger at the state of affairs he finds when he returns in ""Absolute Candor.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Nimbus III**

The Planet of Galactic Peace stands as a contrast to Vashti - Picard and the *Verity* arrive to evacuate the populace, but the independent-minded residents initially refuse. Then the Tal Shiar arrive and take over the operation - Picard feels he has no jurisdiction to argue, and withdraws his Starfleet forces. Leaked footage of the mass executions conducted by the Tal Shiar eventually finds its way to him.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Attack on Mars and the Aftermath**

This event pretty much closes out the novel. Information on exactly what happened is scarce, but the popular belief is that the A500 synths somehow gained sentience and revolted. Maddox is too scatterbrained to be able to say definitely they didn't, Picard is prepared to take this explanation at face value (his attitude toward this is one of my few issues with the novel), and it seems only Raffi suspects that there may be a greater plot at work. Picard is ordered to return to Earth, and he does so, armed with a revised plan of how to redeploy what ships Starfleet has available to continue the evacuation, and fully expecting to get his way. He's completely unprepared to find out that what little remaining support for the evacuation has completely evapourated - he offers his resignation (even he is uncertain as to whether he had intended this as a gamble, or whether he knew deep-down that it was over). Either way, his resignation is accepted, the evacuation efforts are over, and Raffi is left high and dry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's my summary of the things that I found interesting in the novel - again, I would highly encourage anyone who's interested in the story of the evacuation to check it out. Overall, I thought it was a pretty great read.

I'm not proofreading this, so I have no idea if I structured it in a helpful way. If you happen to have any questions, feel free to let me know! What I learned from ""The Last Best Hope"""

startrek,"S3E5 ""Second Skin"" Garak is talking to Bashir about a trip that the Doctor recently took, and has an interesting line that is easy to miss:

GARAK: So how was your trip to Klaestron Four?
BASHIR: Oh, terrific. The Klaestrons have developed a burn treatment technology which has to be seen to be believed.
GARAK: You know, I envy you.
BASHIR: How so?
GARAK: When I was younger, travelling was a bit of a passion for me. There are few things in life that compare with the thrill of immersing yourself in the culture of an alien world, meeting the inhabitants, earning their trust. But aside from our brief excursion to Bajor, I don't think I've been off this station in nearly three years.

Slipping in that bit about ""earning the trust"" of alien inhabitants makes it sound like these probably aren't simple holidays he's reminiscing about haha. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but to me it sounds like one of his many little allusions to his clandestine history. And the moment is gone as soon as he says it, the conversation just moves on. Bashir doesn't even seem to catch it Just caught a funny little moment from Garak on DS9"

startrek,"Hello!

While they are the bad future of Picard Season 2, I thought that the Confederation of Earth was a unique and imposing faction in the show - cold and vicious: a more serious version of the flamboyant Terrans.  I personally find it a great shame that they were only really used for one episode before we are spirited off to modern-day Los Angeles - a setting that I personally find pretty boring overall.  

What do you guys think?  If we spent more episodes in the Confederation of Earth timeline, what would you have liked to explore in such a place: the political dynamics, the power plays, the rank-and-file's opinion on things, the view from regular citizens, etc?

If nothing else, they had snazzy uniforms - simple, but sharp. Does anybody wish we spent more time in the Confederation of Earth timeline? (Picard Season 2)"
startrek,"So, there has been a few births in Star Trek series....they all went the old traditional way to birth....the way most births are done in 2022.......centuries later......same.

startrek,"As I understand it, cloaking devices are designed not to make the ship invisible, but to make them invisible to detection, much like the stealth fighters and bombers we have today. They avoid detection by being invisible to sensors.
So why don’t crew, in battle or near enemy territory, just get stationed at windows to look out and then relay where the ships are to the bridge? Question: If cloaking devices bend sensors to avoid detection, why don’t crews just look out the window?"
startrek,"Hello 

As we have seen several times on Picard, Rios likes smoking cigars or just holding it with his mouth.

Controversial debate: I am a huge Star Trek fan, I loved 2009 and Star Trek Into Darkness, and I love Justin Lin as a director. However, I was extremely disappointed by Star Trek Beyond. I mean, it's a fine movie and it's perfectly watchable. I don't understand why this film gets so much love."
startrek,They wanted complete control of their space and deep space nine being stationed at the mouth of the wormhole on the Alpha Quadrant side gave them a huge advantage. If the Dominion had their own station they could have monitored alpha incursions into their space much more easily. Rewatching the show and this never occurred to me before. Maybe this is an unanswerable question or maybe I just missed something. Why didn't the Dominion set up their own station on the Gamma Quadrant side of the wormhole?
startrek,"I've recently been getting into TOS of Star Trek. I haven't looked to deep into Star Trek lore and stuff, but I can't find an answer to this question. I'm just kinda confused. Can spock feel emotions? I know Spock is half human and half Vulcan, so I assume he can, but does the Vulcan part of him reject emotion biologically? Do they Train to reject emotion, that seems impossible. Responses would be appreciated, thank you for your time! Do Vulcans suppress emotion, or is it biologically disabled?"

startrek,"It's purely efficient, being a Borg would be paradise. Imagine not having any ego and experiencing the euphoria of the collective. The only other society that would be preferable is the Dominion. Anyways, the Borg consciousness is operating at another level. Reading hallucinogenic trip reports on Reddit about a global psyche, the Borg hive mind would be the rigorous, digital implementation of that. In The Best of Both World you are really impressed upon with the fact that the Borg are vastly more evolved than humanity. When Picard says ""we would rather die"" the Borg reply ""death is irrelevant"". Ego and all the joys/pains therein mean nothing to them. Their collective psyche is beyond such concerns, proving Q's point - humanity really is just raw material in comparison. I believe humanity should strive towards becoming the Borg, our progress in transhumanist biomechanical interfaces, social media hive minds and so on could be bootstrapped towards this glorious future. Let us embrace Borgism and become Borg. The Borg Vision of Society is Almost Perfect"
startrek,I would just love to get a feeling more of life outside of starships and the exploration.

This contradicts CoE   Jurati allowing the animated cat to become sentient in the first place so she might just yell “just say meoh you stupid machine” when annoyed.  Is Harvey more sentient in the CoE universe then in the prime universe? In my opinion the  synths are better at problem solving and more proactive but haven’t hit sentience yet.  The Veneration of Adam Soong in the Confederacy might not have a bearing on the status of Altoon Soong, Harvey being created by Maddox out of Data and Soong going rogue like in the prime timeline. But with such a similar design for Harvey in the Prime universe the resemblance likely isn’t a coincidence. (Maddox likely had a key role in the creation of Harvey in both timelines) Jurati’s computer cat saying “meow” in a passive aggressive manner indicates that CoE universe Jurati is paranoid about sentient synths"

After all that I moved on to the movies. I've never seen any of the TOS movies and only remember bits of the movies with the TNG cast so this has been fun to say the least.

During Wrath of Khan, after Spock sacrifices himself, there is a moment where Kirk is called down to Engineering. ""It's urgent."" He looks to Spock's seat and realizes he is gone. You can see his brain working and it shows on his face. He runs down there hoping that what he's thinking isn't true -- but it is. From that scene to the end credits I started crying. I cried again when I recited the whole scene to my wife later that night.

The second time I cried was this morning, right after I had just finished Star Trek VI, starting with the moment Uhura tells Kirk that they've been ordered to dock the ship because it's being decommissioned. The lingering shot of the cast on the deck as they stand there in silence, allowing us one more good look at them, and we reflect **with** them on all of those moments we shared together. That, on top of the last Captain's Log entry Kirk gives, truly made me tear up again.

I'm a sentimental guy, I realize that, but damn did those moments really surprised me.

startrek,"So I noticed that when Guinan summoned Q, she said she was summoning ""The Q"", not ""Q"". And since she had no idea Q existed she had no expectation for him to be the one summoned. She was summoning any Q that would show up.

Now on the last episode, we learn Q is dying. Yet he waa the only one that responded to her summons. So either the whole Continuum is dying and unable to respond, or Q is dying because the timeline they're in the Continuum does not exist. The timeline was obviously different in the future so it would make sense it was a different timeline in the past.

Lastly, why of all species in the galaxy, are El Aurians able to perform a ritual to summon someone from the continuum? And why is there a mutual respect, yet disdain between them? Q looks at guinan and speaks of her species with disdain, but also respect. My last theory is that the Q are the final evolution of El Aurians.

startrek,"I wonder if your *Picard* viewing group is talking about this much as ours is. 

Here's the thing ...

Before transporting from the crashed ship into the world of past Earth, they made a dire warning that any sort of upset from or change to the past would be catastrophic. Then they proceed to follow through on this by centering a drama of an episode about getting Rios from the medical center.

But when they arrive, after tracing the badge, they just look around and leave. Their concern for all the ways Rios could upset the timeline simply fell away even though they literally traced the badge to the place ... because ... they are *sorta* worried about him and forgot they just used the advanced future tech? This would almost keep things moving, but then as if to remind us how stupid our heroes are they even take the time to focus on the badge. The one they just traced there with the tools that give them the ability to retrieve it and eliminate that concern.

But we don't return to it until a couple episodes later, when we finally see Rios reunited with the badge and using it.

So I am confused.

By narratively focusing on the badge and then throwing it away, in your opinion were the writers/directors:

1. Designing the episode to communicate that our heroes are dumber than the viewers? (For example, it's high brow writing to emulate the traumas our heroes are experiencing from their stressful situation, and therefore an explanation for how they lost track of the heavy threat of negative butterfly effects?)

2. Using typical concern tropes to hook people to the next episodes with no actual reward for the concerns or questions they raised ... (something that *Star Trek: Picard* has been generally criticized for)?

3. Actually ***unaware*** that using derivative stylings in your storytelling creates the effect that the season arcs are disjointed and/or ""phoned in""?

4. Something we will have to wait for the last episode to resolve?

5. Something else?

Please let us know your thoughts. Picard season 2: the badge ... bad writing or an example of changing writing styles?"

startrek,"Help I did something this evening that I'm soo ashamed off doing, I watched star wars, I feel so ashamed."
startrek,"I've really enjoyed season 2 of Picard and wanted to share a few thoughts on the most recent episodes. Obviously this contains some spoilers.

Q is dying and is in search of a legacy, a causa sui project that will survive him. That's his plan. He wants humanity to transcend, possibly to someday replace and improve the dying continuum. But there's a problem with humanity, an obstacle preventing them from evolving, something that has them ""stuck"". Q is using this particular human, Picard, in order expose the problem and ""un-stick"" the species by showing him how to un-stick himself. From a perspective of time as long as the Q, it matters very little whether humanity destroys itself early or destroys itself in 1000 years, so the consequence of the timeline changes mean very little to him if he isn't able to get Picard to ""see"" the root of the problem.   


Each thread of this story: Agnes vs. the Borg Queen, Picard vs. his repressed memories, and Soong vs. Self all point to different aspects of the same theme, that there exists an unrecognized shadow or darkness inside all of us. Unless that darkness is recognized and not denied, given power to rise into consciousness and be seen, it threatens to lash out and take over in unpredictable ways. By denying the existence of our id, we stand in danger of becoming our id in the same way that Soong's death fear leads to the Confederation, Agnes' arrogance that she can control the Borg Queen leads to her possession, and Picard's refusal to accept his own pain and ""barbarity"" (reference the trial from Encounter at Farpoint where Picard angrily denied humanity's continued barbarism) prevents him from forming close connections and leads to his isolation. Taken together, these three outcomes form the ultimate fate of the species: Projection of the death fear onto others and coping through domination, unrestrained narcissism in the assimilation of the world, and ultimately dying alone. The failure of humanity to collectively recognize the inner monster damns its ascension. This is possibly the very thing which damned the continuum. That is the problem with the Federation, Section 31, all of it. As long as they falsely believe themselves to be above and beyond their collective darkness, their actions are continually guided by the unseen, unrecognized hand of base animality.  


Each of these can be discussed in detail, but I promised myself not to write book this afternoon.   


Why does Agnes lose control of her body? She becomes flooded with endorphins after putting on a pretty dress and singing to the praise and applause of a crowd. It caused that sort of response because she harbored an unconscious need to be seen and loved. It wasn't the existence of that need which lead to her undoing, but the fact it wasn't known and recognized. The Borg Queen harbored the same need, the primary difference being that unlike Agnes the Queen knew what she wanted and consciously moved toward that end. Absent that knowledge, Agnes was reduced to a puppet. If Agnes ends up being the Borg Queen from the first episode, the line about wanting peace but first needing power is profound. Our shadows are denied power and are repressed, for a time. The slow pressure, rising power, of that suppressed self is what eventually allows it to rise into consciousness. The stronger the block, or the more powerful devastation when the dam finally breaks.   


Why is Adam Soong in such constant agony, willing to break laws, kill people, and sever every connection to humanity even his own daughter? He is possessed by the fact that he will die, and without a legacy, will leave nothing. He is possessed by the fear of annihilation, something I expect he shares with Q. This death fear, a need for immortality, leads him to choose his personal glory over the destruction of the world. His central question becomes, ""What use is a good world if I'm not in it?"" The Confederation which rises in Soong's image is similarly obsessed, wiping out all things not human as if they were inherently existential threats, building legacy through personal domination and will. As Soong pronounced, anyone can procreate (animals), but he created life through sheer will. He wills his immortality into existence in defiance and denial of his nature.   


Why was Picard unable to form a relationship with Laris? He was afraid that inside himself he was the monster he believed his father to be, one who symbolically ""killed"" his mother. He feared loving Laris and becoming his father. This is the one symbol that seems most tied to the continuum. In the face of Picard's fear, he does nothing. Instead of engaging this fear directly, he distracts himself with a constant barrage of adventures and responsibilities. The problem is not that Picard is constantly active, it's the reason that he's active, it's a denial mechanism. It's not the trap that's important, but the escape. How can humanity ever transcend itself if it is constantly busying itself with denial activities?   


Anyway, I think it's a great show, really thought provoking. I'm looking forward to how they wrap this up. My best guess is that Agnes and the Queen form an alliance that's agreeable to them both, part of which is peace with the Federation. I think Picard realizes his fears and finds Laris. Soong, who represents the road not taken, will be defeated. Picard, Q, and the fear of death"
startrek,"The mister and I are rewatching Discovery. And one thing we noticed is apparently in the future. Starfleet just doesn't care about mental health and The biggest example is Tyler having a full blown PTSD attack in front of an Admiral who is specialized in mental health and they still put him out in space, on duty. And then we went into a list of times someone was clearly having a mental break (won't name examples as might be spoiling) and its just apparent they stopped caring about mental health. Why? The human race is supposed to be medically and morally evolved at this point so why is mental healthy blatantly ignored? New Star Trek and Mental Health"
startrek,I absolutely love Michael Giacchino’s “Enterprising Young Men” from Star Trek 09 What do you feel is the best/most iconic piece of score in all the Star Trek movies and shows?
startrek,"  
  I'm around 150 pages from the end of the 3rd book of the Star Trek Coda trilogy and I really can't help but question whether or not our Next Generation cannon universe would survive the Devidians.

   
  **First, what did Q do?** 

  
  Q told Jean-Luc that he was putting humanity on trial. Jean-Luc knew from then on that his every action was being judged and this encouraged Jean-Luc to be more diplomatic and open-minded. To mold him into the type of person who would make the right choices to ensure that he could be there to save the universe when the time came.

  
  **Why did Q do it?** 

  
  The Q continuum had been lame and boring for so many years, right? Existence would have been even less bearable for an immortal if all of the universes were munched up by the Devidians, right? 

  
  **How did this effect history?** 

  
  Picard and friends would have failed to stop the Devidians. They might have even failed the first time that they came into contact with them. Maybe Jean-Luc never even meets Guinan. 

  
  Maybe humanity doesn't meet the Borg until it's too late. 

  
  Maybe there is no civil war in the Q continuum. Maybe they're still just sitting around doing nothing. Isn't it possible that Q made life exciting for the continuum again because fate didn't turn out the way they knew it would? 

  
  Everyone in the continuum knew that the universe was going to come to an end and there's be nothing worth watching and nobody worth bothering because in the end they were not going to exist anymore... until Q changed everything. 

  
  Maybe Jean-Luc isn't so forgiving about how the traveler threw the Enterprise off course and maybe he doesn't encourage Westley as the traveler instructed Picard to do.   

  
  If Westley isn't a traveler, Jean-Luc and friends have absolutely no idea what's going on duing the Coda trilogyand 100% of Star Fleet just sticks their head in the sand when the universe begins coming undone and goodbye, thanks for the fish to our entire timeline! 

  
  Thoughts? Q interrupted Jean-Luc and the Enterprise on their way to Farpoint Station to give their universe a chance to exist. (Star Trek Coda trilogy spoilers)"
startrek,This is my favourite of the Kelvin timeline of movies but one thing I keep thinking about is the ships crew. How many of the Enterprise crew did Kirk and company actually manage to save by the end of the movie? [Star Trek Beyond] How many of the crew did Kirk and company save?
startrek,"O'Brien's 8yr old daughter is pulled out of a time portal and is now a mal adjusted 18yr old bush girl.. 

They spend like... a month? Trying to rehabilitate her, Starfleet even wants to put her up at a special development centre. But no after one month the O'Briens decide to send her back into the past 300yrs so she can live on an uninhabited planet and fend for herself. Because ""it's the best thing for her"". 

lol like what the actual fuck?!
Hey sorry kid, it's taking too long for you to re-adjust so we are just going to ditch you now. Byeeeeee I just watched 'Times Orphan' and ....🤣🤣🤣 What the actual f**K 🤣🤣🤣"
startrek,"Mine is the time they discovered the origin of all humanoid life. You’d think that would have been a big deal that would have come up at some point. Even if it’s just a throwaway scene along the lines of:

Crusher: I got another invitation to speak at a conference about that time we discovered the origin of all humanoid life. Want to go?

Picard: Oh, I get a few of those a week. If I said yes to all of them I’d never get any work done. 

Crusher: Maybe we should just write a book?

Picard: It’s on my list of things to do if I ever retire, but first I plan to solve that “warp drive destroys space” problem. 

Crusher: Oh right, I forgot about that. I guess that’s more pressing. What’s your favorite world changing discovery that never gets mentioned again?"
startrek,"- The episode opens to a flashback of a young boy, whom we’ll learn is FBI Agent Wells, rushing through the woods and encountering a Vulcan. Prior to the official first contact in “First Contact”, we’re away of multiple incidents of Vulcans on Earth.

    - Spock visited Earth in “The City on the Edge of Forever” after travelling through Carl to 1930, and was instrumental in seeing to it that Kirk allowed a the owner of a soup kitchen to die.

    - In “Carbon Creek”, T’Pol tells the story of an ancestor, T’Mir, whose scout ship crash landed outside the titular town while investigating the Sputnik satellite in 1957. T’Mir, Mestral, and Stron spent nearly a year pretending to be human and living in Pennsylvania before being rescued in 1958. Mestral choose to remain on Earth, and T’Mir reported him as officially having perished in the crash.

    - In “Assignment: Earth” the Enterprise travelled to 1967, just to check it out, and Spock traveled to the planet with Kirk to bumble around a bit while Gary Seven attempted to back door pilot his way into a series.

        - Of note, before acquiescing to let Mestral remain on Earth, T’Mir did say she could attempt for him to return on the next survey mission, which would have been 20 years later 1978, and was intended to only do scans from high orbit.

    - In 1986, Spock travels to Earth’s history again in “The Voyage Home” to rescue some humpback whales, so that they in turn and rescue Earth in 2286.

    - In “Future’s End” Tuvok is part of the away mission to Los Angeles in 1996, where he gets to prevent Tom Paris from spending any alone time with Rain Robinson, and blew up a semi-truck with his phaser. His official log described the mission as, “Most agreeable.”

    - “Carpenter Street” has T’Pol visit Eart in 2004 along with Archer, to stop a Xindi-Reptillian plot.

- Kore dons a set of goggles she refers to as *”Aspectus”* which generates a holographic simulation of her father’s laboratory. Obviously a long way off from a holodeck, but we’ve seen devices which create single user experiences before, such as Captain Ransom’s synaptic simulator from “Equinox”, or the device Stamets was using to rewatch a message from Hugh Culber in “Brother”.

- *”Am I--am I an experiment”* Kore appears to have forgotten her own discovery just two episodes ago.

- Kore’s table has three books on it: “Moby Dick” by Herman Melville, John Milton’s “Paradise Lost”, and ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie, all of which are on Khan’s bookshelf aboard the *SS Botany Bay* in “The Wrath of Khan”.

- Q’s gift to Kore is a vial of blue liquid with a tag reading *“Freedom”* attached to it by twine. Maybe it’s a stretch, but this struck me as very reminiscent of the potion labeled *“Drink Me”* in “Alice in Wonderland”, a work that Star Trek has referenced many times over the decades, going all the way back to the TOS episode, “Shore Leave”. Though the Lewis Carroll story does describe the colour of the potion (only that it is not marked poison, and therefore safe for consumption) it is frequently depicted as blue in adaptations.

- Apparently Rios left his combadge behind last episode when he transported to *La Sirena*. Again. Lost communicator on a primitive world tally:

    - TOS: 1 - McCoy, “A Piece of the Action”

    - ENT: 1 - Reed, “The Communicator”

    - PIC: 3 - Rios, “Assimilation”; “Monsters”; Picard, “Monsters”

- Ricardo gets sick after eating too much cake, which also happened to Juarti in “Napenthe” last season.

- Picard appears to be completely unphased by Wells’ attempts at interrogation, which makes sense because he doesn’t hold a candle to Gul Madred, who interrogated and tortured Picard in “Chain of Command” but was not able to break him.

- Q recognises Guinan, whom we learned he has a history with in “Q Who”, though he says the two of them haven’t crossed paths yet in the 21st century.

    - In “Q Who”, it was the first time Q had encountered Guinan using that name, but he’s aware of it here, because from his perspective, he’s met her using it previously.

- Guinan is able to telepathically communicate with Picard. I believe this is the first time an El-Aurian has exhibited this ability.

- In Wells’ flashback the Vulcan attempting to mind meld with him is transported away. in “Daedalus” the human, Emory Erickson, was described as being *”Father of the transporter”*, though that could be similar to Zephram Cochrane being *”the discoverer of the space warp”* or Henry Archer creating the first warp five engine. Regardless, this is the earliest point in the timeline where we see Vulcans using a transporter.

- *”She’s looking to get a 400 year headstart on assimilating the galaxy.”* Though the Borg would control a large swath of the Delta Quadrant at this time period, prior to “Best of Both Worlds” they weren’t interested in assimilating people, only technology. *”Their priorities [seemed] to have changed,”* as Picard said at the time. Canon Connections: Picard 2x08 - Mercy"
startrek,"In ST: Picard, we know that Soong has created Kore, and previously several similar incarnations. But what is Kore?

Unless I missed something, she's human, or at least creating a human was Soong's goal. But how is this special? If Soong is trying to do in a lab what most couples can do in a bedroom, then I just don't understand his goal.

I feel like it would make more sense if he was modifying the genes of an embryo to create characteristics that don't currently occur in nature, but the only special characteristic we've  seen in Kore is her inability to tolerate sunlight. What is Adam Soong trying to accomplish?"
startrek,"I and several friends have been searching relentlessly online for several months, and unfortunately the only uniforms we can find are the thigh-high TOS dresses, and men’s uniforms. We have our school semi-formal coming up, and because it’s mostly fun costumes, wanted to cosplay Deep Space 9.

We’re rapidly losing hope, any help is appreciated. If you even know of a general website or seller online where you got something vaguely similar, I’d appreciate it.

P.S. Blue and gold uniforms are preferred, but at this point we’d take a purple one for all we care. Help!! Is there *anywhere* to buy DS9 women’s uniforms? (in blue or gold, preferably?)"
startrek,I'm currently watching voyager and everytime Chakotay brings up his spiritual or mystic beliefs I cringe. Not because of the fake consultant they had but because I feel like in the 24th century people would've moved on from these things. No other human belief system is showcased or even acknowledged (I havent seen one character named Muhammad or Jesus). Infact most humans/starfleet personal on DS9 deny the prophets are gods. I just find it odd that people that devote their lives to science and exploration (and most likely deny other beliefs) would be so taken by Chakotay's mysticism or the fact he even believes the way he does. Voyager Native American mysticism cringe
startrek,"One of my worries with star trek in its current form is the ease with which time travel and changing events in the past becomes a crutch for storylines - we see characters make a decision to ""change the past, to save the future"" and thereby restoring events that fit within the ""prime timeline"" i.e. the storyline of a TV series and the way it sl""should"" be. We also see characters break the prime directive, deliberately or otherwise and minor changes to be made to the timeline. This in many ways is an excuse to retcon visual and logical imperfections in the series: that time travel shenanigans since the original episode aired has meant that the timeline has subtly permanently changed in order to fit a new narrative and visual aesthetic. In many ways I'm not against this and it is of course part of the fun in discussing time travel. However, does this mean that there is less of a logic when characters go back in time and don't save characters who they were sad to lose? Tasha Year, Data, Heck, Picard in the Nexus didn't think to go back slightly further in time, save his brother and nephew, and then punch soran in the nose when he saw him in ten forward. If characters were to be brought back more easily would this risk making the series like marvel movies - where a characters death is rarely a reason we won't see them again and thereby lose the impact of their loss? time travel, storylines and immutability. Does an ease in changing the past make current events less impactful?"
startrek,"I posted this after episode 1 and got removed.  It was an assumption not a guess.

The show seems to focus around aging and choices. Claims have been made that the final season 3 of Picard will be his end. They DID tape the seasons back to back as well. In 2 # 2 Q is a bit confused and Picard referenced him 'not being well.' Perhaps after billions of years Q has reached his finality and questions his own choices, yet again choosing Picard for his final outing. (Get it right, get removed!) Q is Dying"
startrek,"I like to look at the various series and films as recreations of actual events. As if the events portrayed really happened, but they are being recreated for us to watch, and due to incomplete records and production errors, there are mistakes. It helps me overlook continuity errors such as O’Brien’s rank, Data’s use of a contraction, or Voyager’s endless torpedos. My Take on Continuity Errors"
startrek,The idea of a Star Trek episode following the Rashomon formula sounds like a can't miss. Then you get the horrid acting of the guest stars and a script that cannot avoid the fact that we all know that Riker cannot possibly have murdered the scientist guy since he is in the opening credits of the goddamn show.

So I just finished this episode, and I’m wondering if it’s possible that Eddington may have sabotaged the experiment Dax and Kahn were working on. 

Think about it. If ships can reliably create a wormhole to wherever they want whenever they want, wouldn’t the Bajoran sector become less important to the Federation, thereby making the Maquis plight less important and impactful? I think that would certainly be detrimental to their plans. Obviously conjecture as there’s not much to base it on other than “He was there” and “We know later he’s a traitor” DS-9 Episode 4-5 Rejoined."
startrek,"Fam and I are watching Voyager for first time. Oh we’ve seen an episode here and there but this is our official start to finish watching. 

The best part of it is when we talk about it during ‘commercial breaks’ or between episodes but my fam (myself included) could use some extra ammunition for post episode discussion. 

Does anyone have a resource that has talking points and stuff of that nature?

I mean, we gonna watch it through and we are loving it, I just want to add a few minutes for discussion after/before. 

Thoughts? Voyager Watchalong/Discourse"
startrek,"You can't choose the Enterprise, as it's a ship, not a character. My vote goes for Worf as the major character and for the Douwd posing as Kevin Uxbridge for the minor character. Who is the most tragic character in all of Star Trek?"
startrek,"Sorry if this isn’t directly Trek-related, but just wanted to let everyone know our favorite ‘new’ captain Rios (Santiago Cabrera) is on season 2 of Flight Attendant starting Kaley Cuoco on HBO Max. The first season was pretty great IMO and I’m looking forward to the second. Captain Rios is on Flight Attendant!"
startrek,"I only seen Discovery Season 1 and Prodigy. Discovery was a mixed bag and it didn't feel like Star Trek to me. Prodigy was different but in a very good way. Picard and Lower Decks don't really look appealing. Also, if I were to watch Picard, will I have to see Next Generation first? I grew up with The Next Generation but I don't remember much. How Would U Rank Every Modern Star Trek Show Since Discovery?"
startrek,"When we first watched TNG, i decided to skip Sub Rosa, because well, Sub Rosa. I refused to elaborate, but she trusted me.

Now she remembered that and decided she wants to see it on her own. Can't wait for the feedback! my gf is in for one hell of a ride"
startrek,Not that I'm complaining. We've seen multiple Orion women in Starfleet; where the fuck are the Orion men?
startrek,"Watching so many Star Trek shows, in many of the episodes, a Starfleet officer gets stuck or lost because they take their comm badges off, or it gets taken from them. Even with the Borg being cybernetic, WHY wouldn't the Federation have developed some form of internal communication and tracking system for their crewmembers? Not necessarily nanotechnology like the Borg, but just implanted communication systems where the Crew has a permanent tracker and communication system they can access or have accessed that tracks their position and health. 
For example, the current episode of Picard. The situation Picard, Rios or the others have found themselves in during this season would mostly have been resolved if they had an internal system. why wouldn't the Federation have developed an internal system for their comms and tracking yet? why rely on external comm badges?"
startrek,"Haven’t seen any of these new shows, but am curious if anything from Enterprise is referenced. Always hear about TOS and TNG references, but am curious if ENT got any recognition/love. Any references to Enterprise in any of these new shows?"
startrek,"When ENT first came out, I didn't like it and stopped watching after the first episode. However, I decided to watch it all now, and after finishing it, it makes sense why it is always left out in discussions and lists. The characters were just there (T'Pol, Mayweather, your captain orders you to stare out into space for several minutes), and the more interesting ones, like Hoshi Sato and Phlox, were undeveloped. 1st and 2nd seasons did not make an impression, and the more interesting 3rd and 4th season arcs had probalby already lost the audience back in those early 00's days. Plus, the theme music was cringe inducing. I just finished ENT. I get why it is so forgotten now."
startrek,"I was born (1989)  when TNG came out, so I saw it later ( first at 2008 ). 

Characters in TNG seem to always put principles and morals first. They believe holding on to their core ideals will build the best future.

TNG pointed out that the core of humanity, while flawed, is inheritnely good, curious, open-minded, and wanting to evolve, and moving towards a more utopian society. 

New shows like Discovery and Picard (to a lesser extent) are less idealistic and optimistic. There's also more swearing, and fewer philosophical speeches about staying true to our core ethics

I don't remember the time when TNG aired, but it seems the mindset of society, and expectations of the future have become more pessimistic? Were people more optimistic about the future when TNG aired?"
startrek,I haven't watched it in a few years but I don't think they'd ever stated this on screen we just know he wants the Genesis device. Am I correct in assuming that do? In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan I've always assumed that Khan wanted the Genesis device to terraform Ceti Alpha 5

startrek,"I am re-watching through all the Star Trek movies and currently on generations. Everyone laughs worf falling into the water on the Holodeck Data ask crasher why that was particularly funny and she tells him it was because it was an unsuspecting surprise so he then gently pushes her off the boat And everyone reacts like data just snap her neck or some thing. I’m not really sure why it’s portrayed as some unforgivable awful act that data did ? Everyone was laughing at worf Falling off the boat Beverly falling and is somehow beyond the pale, is the logic just because she’s a woman because that doesn’t seem to fit Star Trek  Sexism  free society to me. Data asking someone why that particular event was funny and then immediately doing the same to them is a pretty good grasp of humor and camaraderie would are the been OK if it was Jordi or riker? Data pushing Dr. crusher off of the boat it’s actually pretty funny."

starwars,"Lego Star Wars: The Video Game is a Lego game about all three of the prequel Star Wars films, including Revenge of the Sith. All the big beats of the story of this film are in the game and important to playing it. Seeing as it released before Revenge of the Sith even came out, was there any fan reaction to this at the time? That the story of the movie was spoiled through the game? Lego Star Wars: The Video Game was released before Revenge of the Sith"
starwars,Writing was horrible constant nostalgia pandering dumb reva plot when the grand inquisitor could’ve been doing everything she was so we don’t have to set her up to take away from the actual story of OBI WAN then we should’ve had him defending like trying to pull the empire away from them since he maybe knows Vader is coming and possibly would sense luke so he travels elsewhere leaving clues for inquisitors but instead we get a way too confident and capable 7 year old PRINCESS leia that somehow knows high level mechanics and have an entire story around her because obi wan needs to save her instead of the entire planet and system she has backing her like wtf is this show could’ve seen young Luke doing stuff obiwan actually training with quigon ghost trying to tap into force further  also the rushed cgi and constantly inconsistent force writing one second they are using it the next they can’t or within a day obiwan is back to his old self no training or def reflecting of any kind  can hold back glass also the stupid break in where storm trooper gets beat by his helmet being pushed idk how people are genuinely liking this series at all My rant on obiwan show
starwars,"My friends love to piss me off and say its like “yeah I’m AT the store” so they say AT-AT, but I just say at-at like AT&amp;T Is it AT-AT(aht-aht) or is it A T-A T (a t- a t)"
starwars,"Maul. We know he’s around mixing it up with inquisitors. I’m not saying he should be interacting with Obi-wan but it would be awesome to see at least one live action, Ray Park, Darth Maul badass lightsaber dual again. Obi-wan Kenobi Season 2 - Must have Cameo"
starwars,"I'd love to get a high-quality edit to the fight with that conclusion.

Put simply, it was the end of Reva's story. She allowed revenge to cloud her judgement, and failed to assassinate Vader. The idea that she somehow survived ANOTHER lightsaber stab, and managed to get off-world is just ridiculous. They didn't even show her leave!

Don't writers know by now obvious things that will be nit-picked? Why would Reva even bother going after some kid? From what we saw, she didn't even tend to the gaping wound in her stomache. She was just walking around Tatooine, as if she was totally fine, and even had the energy to fight the Lars family, and chase down Luke. Why did she even want to kill him? She hated Vader for killing kids, yet travelled to Tatooine to do it, herself? How is that ""justice""??

Again, Vader should've killed Reva. The final episode of the series should've been focused exclusively on Obi-Wan and Vader. We didn't need Reva to go back to Tatooine at all. Hell, they could've left her fate up in the air. That would've been fine, but as it is now, there are more plot-holes than swiss cheese. Vader should've ""Dooku'd"" Reva with her own lightsaber."
starwars,"I'm using this flair because i'm not quite sure which to use.

I'm going to have a lightsaber duel with my friends later this month or early next month, but i need to know what lightsaber forms are commonly used by the sith (used more by sith than jedi) or are more effective at blocking lightsaber combat. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks! What is the best lightsaber form for me?"
starwars,"Two things made me wonder: firstly, I find it hard to believe he'd mess up a sabre to the chest on Reva a 2nd time so I am left to suppose he might have done it on purpose; either as a Vader joke realizing he'd done it once before, or because he genuinely stayed his hand. The other reason is the way he seems to absolve Kenobi from responsibility for Vader's creation. Sure, he frames it in a typical Sith manner followed by ""I will destroy you!"" but I kind of wonder if it wasn't Anakin briefly breaking through to give what small mercies he was capable of as Vader. Did Vader secretly show compassion in Kenobi?"
starwars,"just a funny video i found on the net.

[https://youtu.be/nut\_pxbHEj0](https://youtu.be/nut_pxbHEj0) If obi wan vs darth vader was with health bars....."
starwars,"The reveal in TROS that Rey is Palpatine’s “granddaughter” (I think I’ve read that her father is actually a Palpatine CLONE, not his actual son, in some expanded canon material), left us with huge huge gaps in the storytelling that we didn’t get, IMO, enough on screen to make that reveal feel satisfying and meaningful.

I believe this would sit so much better with me and other fans I’d we got a really solid series, animated or live action, that gave us that story. A show that showed Palpatine’s preparations for the Empire’s defeat in ROTJ, and scenes set on Exogol with the Sith Cultists. And centering it on Rey’s father and his journey rejecting his Clone “father” and going into hiding. 

There’s so much potential to make the sequels really feel tied into everything, maybe with some backstory and exposition on how this all fits in with the Chosen One prophesy, etc.

The only obstacle I see in making this is that I’m not sure if LF wants to invest in ST centric stories right now. And this series would need the care and production level of the clone wars to truly make it great. It would do for the ST what clone wars did for the PT in expanding the story and making everything feel more connected.

But I’m not sure LF would green light this type of story since they seem to not want to touch any of the ST stuff right now with the fandom seemingly more interested in OT-connected stories and the “mando verse” timeline. 

Do we think Disney and LF will invest in such storytelling that will truly serve the sequel trilogy? Do we think Disney+/Lucasfilm will ever give us a fleshed out series to show us Rey’s father’s backstory?"
starwars,"1: Darth Vader gives up on turning Luke, so he kidnaps C-3PO, manages to give him his memories of being made by Anakin back, and attempts to turn him to the dark side, much to Palpatine's confusion and annoyance.

2: Jar Jar Binks is the chosen one with force powers and not Anakin.

3: C-3PO gets way too much into his Ewok God role and becomes official monarch of Endor, becoming a third party in The Force Awakens wanting to defeat both the Resistance since Luke is no longer with them as well as the First Order.

4: Darth Maul's legs somehow also survive with his upper body, becoming a recurring character in the following media. He is also clearly the better half of the two and has an adorable laugh that's done in Morse Code, and if he dies, Maul's upper body will also die, but not the other way around.

5: All vehicles have sentient computer AI, and can defy their pilots when they think they're being stupid. Which of these incredibly weird and nonsensical What If? scenarios I came up would make the franchise the most horrible?"
starwars,"Maybe I’m alone on this train of thought, but after exploring more of Vader’s character throughout the comics it seems clear to me that Vader wants to die. As we know, the thing Vader hates most, is himself.

The way I interpret the end of their fight in Obi-Wan, when Vader is screaming “Obi-Wan!” I think he is basically asking for him to not leave him again, and finish the job. He clearly was in no state to fight, or else he would’ve continued to fight Obi-Wan. 

At this point I believe Vader is fully aware he has been fooled by the Emperor, and there is nothing he can do to change it. So he continues to serve blindly. It isn’t until Luke arrives where perhaps Vader sees more to life than dying and serving. As he initially wants Luke to join him, so they can rule the galaxy as father and son.

He sees that his son will not make the same mistake that he once did, and in the end is willing to DIE for his son. His last act, as a Jedi.

Do you agree? Lmk what you think. Vader WANTS death."
starwars,"The line from _Obi-Wan Kenobi_, ""I am what you made me"" isn't a reference to Vader's fall to the dark side. He's literally refering to his physical appearance, reminding Obi-Wan that **he** is the reason he needs a life support suit to survive.

Vader doesn't regret falling to the Dark Side (Anakin does). He regrets being defeated by Obi-Wan. That's why, when he sees that Obi-Wan is full of guilt, and no longer wanted to kill him, he ""comforts"" him by saying that he's not his failure. He **chose** his own path. Remember, before Anakin's fall, the two were on good terms. He didn't originally intend to kill Obi-Wan, yet, when Obi-Wan departed for Mustafar, he intended to kill Anakin. And of course, Anakin believed that Padmé willingly brought him there.

The source of Obi-Wan's guilt is that he failed his apprentice, but the source of Vader's is that he failed to defeat his master. Of course, deep down, Anakin does regret his decision to turn to the dark side, but that's kept in check by his other personality. Darth Vader hates Obi-Wan, not because he blames him for his fall to the Dark Side, but because he turned Padmé against him and destroyed his body."
starwars,"Dear Disney,
Hello there. You’ve been doing a helluva job with all the new Star Wars shows. This is in contrast to the sequel movies, which were (to put it lightly) a disappointment to many of us.

I just finished Obi Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus. It was spectacular, like the Mandalorian before it. Thanks for giving the OT fans what we’ve all been wanting for 40 years - something that looks, sounds and feels like Authentic Star Wars.

I’m all for Disney taking creative liberties with the franchise. It’s just that JJ Abrams’ version of it was a dumpster fire. I wish someone could simply wipe my mind like a protocol droid so I could pretend the sequel movies never happened. But alas, I can’t unsee them.

So, I’m writing to request that you right those wrongs and use those creative liberties to provide a great service to the fans. 

Please consider hiring Quentin Tarantino to direct a Kill-Bill style revenge movie starring Samuel L. Jackson as a back-from the-dead Mace Windu, who comes back ready to own some mother fuckers.

This is the only thing left from Star Wars I really want to see before I die. That, and Baby Yoda kicking some ass at his side. 

Thanks for your consideration. 

Sincerely,
A Star Wars Fan An Open Letter to Disney"
starwars,"RomCom? Police procedural (like Law and Order)? Old-school murder mystery - 12 suspects holed up together on a spaceship? Spinal Tap style mockumentary about Max Rebo and his crew going up against the Modal Nodes?

They've got the sci-fi/western/samurai format downpat; Rogue One was a great war movie. 

What else should they be tapping in to? What film or television format has the SWCU yet to use, and why should they fast-track it?"
starwars,"Including one Owen Skywalker, last known address, same as his sister? The force is related to genetics right? I wonder if there’s some inquisitor out there that looked up the Jedi records and decided to pay the relatives of the Jedi a visit"
starwars,"Darth sidious is a version of vader that never turned back to the good side, thats why he looks like that. how does that make sense? You ask, figure it out i say Darth Sidious is a future version of darth vader"
starwars,"It is usually portrayed that the Empire / First Order used fear as their primary tactic to gain and keep control over the Galaxy (Episode 4). Fear and strength are a cornerstone of authoritarian rule. Another cornerstone tactic is propaganda. In Episode 3, Palpatine is seen justifying the attack on the Jedi Temple to the Senate by arguing that the Jedi have turned against him and therefore, against the Republic. I'm starting to think that the following galaxy-wide and merciless persecution of the Jedi was counterproductive. This cast the Jedi and their ideals as a rallying cry for resistance movements like the Rebellion, ultimately leading to the fall of the Empire. A more nuanced stance may have been more effective. But the Sith do deal in absolutes.

- Was there an ideological propaganda machine that worked to discredit the Jedi to accompany the Inquisitors who physically hunted them and instilled Fear to dissuade the common people from rendering aid to the fleeing Jedi?
- What was the nature of the Empire's 'control' over the average star system? Was it even necessary to run a massive propaganda machine if their military might versus the average planetary defense was overwhelming? 
- Would the Empire have been more successful with an alternative propaganda strategy? What propaganda was used / would have been used by the Empire to maintain control in the Galaxy?"
starwars,I was just randomly thinking. Has any Jedi ever turned their lightsaber off during combat to avoid a strike and through their enemy off balance? I just thought it could be a cool scene to see. Question
starwars,"Make the focus on those that want revenge on Kenobi rather than Kenobi himself. Namely, Maul! (And one other I can think of)

There’s a couple things lingering that might be interesting to see:

-Maul’s time running Crimson dawn
-How Maul knows so much about Vader in Rebels

The spin-off could be a maul/crimson dawn focused story in which Maul is searching for Kenobi. Maul hears somehow of the events of OWK season 1 and seeks out Vader to gain insight on how to find Kenobi. We see the interaction of Crimson Dawn with the Empire and could even see an entourage of familiar criminals come into play like Hondo and a young Boba Fett and Bossk enter the story (seeing how a young boba becomes a favorite of Vader.)

This could culminate with an epic fight between maul and vader, where vader ultimately triumphs, which leads maul to rightly fear vader as we see he does in Rebels.

And meanwhile, one other foe also seeks out Kenobi for revenge…..Grievous. 

Grevious somehow survived ROTS and is also seeking Kenobi. Maybe maul and grievous go head to head as well, and somehow Grievous finds out that Kenobi is on tatooine, leading him to a final epic fight between Kenobi and grievous. 

This is a bit of a word vomit of cool ideas that would need clever and well written ways to make it all make sense but I do think there’s some cool stories to tell here if it focuses more on those who still want to find Kenobi and not just on Kenobi himself. Kenobi would be the Mcguffin rather than the main character.

Could even bring Katie sackoff in there as Bo katan to interface with her relationship to maul and kenobis history with her sister.

Thoughts? Some cool things they could do with a Kenobi sequel season/movie/spinoff"
starwars,"As far as I know he's only showed that in the BF games, seeing as it's a game and to not take seriously but I can't help but wonder if they have done it before. Is it true that Darth Vader and Sidious can slow fall/float"
starwars,"So I was bought Darth Vader Imperial Machine as a birthday present. I just finished it, and really enjoyed it

I'm a bit lost though on what I should look at next, as there's a lot of Darth Vader comics out there it seems!

For context: I'm pretty au fait with Star Wars; watched all the movies, clone wars, rebels etc, and I've played Jedi Fallen Order, but I've never read any of the books or comics before, and there's a lot of them for a newbie to know where to start!

If there are any comics continuing the story of the inquisitors, that would certainly be of interest. I'd also be interested in other characters and periods if there's a strong ""this is definitely one to read"" (like the comic equivalent of KOTOR or something!)

Any recommendations from the community? I just finished reading Darth Vader Imperial Machine and I'm looking for recommendations for what to read next!"
starwars,I'm just confused. For example in Kenobi ep5 people say they didn't like it becuase it is clear why Vader and The GI let Reva live. I just don't get how that can affect your enjoyment. Like how can something like that literally make you not enjoy what you are watching. I just don't get it. Its a small thing and hardly makes it boring or anything so why? Please can someone explain. Why do small things hinder people's enjoyment of the movies/TV?
starwars,"I commented this, on a recent post and I think it encapsulates some of the backlash these series have endured.

The biggest problem with both series was the main character

Let's start with Boba Fett.
Characterised as one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. Travelling around taking people down.
His scene in Mando S2 against the stormtroopers was a series highlight!
Then I loved and appreciated all the backstory and character growth but I don't think anyone appreciated Boba sat on tattoine for an entire series without so much of a sniff of his badass bounty hunting.

Thankfully the hints at the end of series one indicate Boba wants to leave tattoine as he's not suited to it. So going forwards we should get a better series 2

On to Obi Wan
Again presented as one of the most brilliant Jedi ever to have lived. Presented amazingly well through the movies and  clone wars and rebels.
Then to see him a broken man hiding away not using the force running from the empire it was a great grounded character portrayal and growth but not what the audience expected or dare I say wanted. As his confidence grew and he became more if his old self the reactions to the episodes got better

When we see series 2 let's hope for more of the character we love

I actually really enjoyed both series but thought these interesting points

Well these my opinions.
Hope you all continue to enjoy star wars Obi Wan and Bobas biggest problem"
starwars,"Everyone seems to think Vader is forgiving Kenobi and that it wasn't his fault that Anakin turned to the dark side. But that doesn't feel complete to me.

It doesn't make sense to me that Vader would ease kenobis mind by telling him that it's not his fault. After all, I thought Vader wanted to torture him both mentally and physically. I think Vader is actually just gloating about killing Anakin and it's meant to further scar kenobi who mourns his brother. Kenobi thought he only had to say goodbye once and now Vader has made it so he has to say again.

I feel like this is a deeper read into the scene than the one circulating. Obviously might be wrong. Thoughts? I think people might misinterpret that scene in S1E6 of Kenobi (spoiler)"

starwars,"To be clear, I totally buy the idea that Obi is one of the greatest duellists in all of Star Wars lore. But he was comprehensively and convincingly beaten by Dooku twice. Then Anakin defeated Dooku fairly comfortably in EpIII. This indicates that Anakin/Vader should be better than both of them in lightsaber combat. So how tare we to rationalise the fact that Obi beat prime Vader on no less than two occasions? To me, Count Dooku's duels over the years seem to raise question marks about Obi-Wan's power/duelling ability."
starwars,Just curious 🤔 How much money would you pay to sit down with George Lucas and hear his original plans for the sequel trilogy?
starwars,"Maybe that’s a frequently asked/stupid question, but seeing Anakin and ObiWan training made me think: were those real sabers? As much control they had, seems dangerous Jedi training"
starwars,"Obviously, as a whole, it's not a well written, high quality product. I get that.

But you have to understand that this whole miniseries wasn't planned, or well thought out.. They had this one cool idea (the Anakin / Obi-Wan scene in the finale) that they really wanted to make for the fans, and then they just sort of built a miniseries around it. You can even hear them say this in multiple interviews, they didn't know whether it should be a movie, a series, or something else.

That one scene was great (not perfect, but you have to admit it was pretty iconic and emotional), and the rest of the season was kinda just lazy, poorly written filler. But that's just the way it is, enjoy the finale and stop overthinking the rest of the show. Hell, the writers/showrunners didn't give it as much though as we are 😅 Just enjoy the Obi-Wan series for what it is.."
starwars,"Hi Guys. Please lighten this topic for me. I was looking for sth like that here, but did not find anything on it. So.. Who was more powerful in the terms of the force - Anakin Skywalker or Darth Vader. Per George Lucas - now canon - midichlorian bullshit - it should be Anakin. Since midichlorians lives in cells - and he lost quite a few. But...  


After fight with Dooku in ep. 2, in which he had lost an arm - Anakin said - since the last time we met my power have doubled. That would mean that the fact that he lost hand did not affect his power lvls.

Also Vader was supposed to be rather op - at least in legends and canon games. 

So which is it? Does ones limps losing decrease midichlorian ergo power lvl or not? Anakin&amp;Darth Vader power comparison"
starwars,"And Ahsoka is many of our favourite characters. So if they have more planned for her, we gotta trust Filoni and Co have a plan 🙏 Remember the Ahsoka hate after The Clone Wars movie? Feels similar to Reva hate ATM."
starwars,I think what the season finale has done either unintentionally or by design has created a direct relationship ship between Leia and Kenobi. The storyline of Kenobi doesn't really make sense when I think of Leia reaching out to Ben in a New Hope as she does it so formally as if she hasn't met him before. Leia naming her son Ben finally makes some sense.
starwars,"Im not the biggest fan of the kenobi series its better than bobf  so theres that at least and instead of me complaining abt a bunch of stuff probs already said j gonna do this cause its also funny

Vader in canon comic:

starwars,Do you feel two centuries are enough for any potentially live-adaptations of the High Republic to distance themselves from the Skywalker saga? Is 200 years a bit between the High Republic and the events of the Phantom Menace?
starwars,"Is the fact that all the action sequence felt like they were filmed on a handheld iPhone, way to much shaky cam. My only complaint about Kenobi…"
starwars,"So I was thinking… when are we going to get a tv serious possibly on how exactly did Sheer Palpatine become the Sith Lord know as Dark Sidious, like when and where did he meet his master, when did he build his own light saber, when and where did he meet his apprentice Dark Maul, when did he backstab his own master and become a Sith Lord ect because it would be really cool to see what made palpatine become so crazy and able to make the Jedi not realize he is a Sith Lord until it was to late.

I also think it would be cool if Disney decided to make some prequel shows for a other notable characters as well.

Below here is a list of characters I think Disney should make shows about.

1: Yoda
2: Jedi Master Sifo Dyas
3: Mace Windu
4: Count Dooku
5: General Grievous
6: Jango Feet 

Let me know what you all think and stuff, because I really want some more Star Wars shows. The Rise of Dark Sidious (Prequel Star Wars Show Ideas)"
starwars,I really want to see what happened since it was like the breaking point of the clone wars I also want to see shaak ti protect papa palps (sidious) Does anyone else want to see an animated battle of coruscant video on disney+?
starwars,"A sequel to the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, we see a redeemed Reva joining the Path so she can help Force sensitive children the way she was never helped. For the main cast we have Light Side Reva, Roken and maybe Quinlan Vos (!). For the antagonist we'd have the Grand Inquisitor and maybe the Fifth Brother and Fourth Sister. This would conclude the secondary story of the Kenobi show, the Inquisitors chace of the Path. An idea for the rumored Reva spinoff"
starwars,"I needed some time to think about this topic because A) It's highly unnecessary, but B) My brothers and I had a discussion about it and I came to the conclusion that the fights can't be compared on an emotional level nor can they be compared in terms of the courses they take.

I say this because both conclude very different stories at very different points in both character's lives. Not to mention one is taking place on a planet with many levels and breakable mechanisms (Mustafar) while they other is straight-up rock spires.

Anyway, I want to talk purely about the quality of the fighting in Obi-Wan Vs. Vader VS Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin because I've watched back both fights several times back-to-back now and have deduced that while Episode 3 is fast-paced and very well choreographed, it feels to light and flashy. It has that strong sense of ""we planned this"", and it doesn't much feel like a true fight to the death. This may be because Obi-Wan isn't outright trying to kill Anakin as his resolve in Episode 3 is drastically different from his resolve in the finale of Obi-Wan, and to that I raise Anakin's side which still doesn't feel like he's swinging to kill. I won't be told that he's fighting himself inside to 'not kill'. He's there to kill. No questions asked and the same could be argued for Obi-Wan but I'll let the ""Obi-Wan still loves him"" argument slide (listen to me, speaking as if I have this mighty opinion lol).

With that said however, Obi-Wan Vs. Vader feels heavy. It feels primal and gritty-- like a real fight to the death where every swing is swung to deal damage. It feels real and it's funny because they do inflict damage on one another whether it be via force, which, hey! They're using the force in this fight! Or by way of sabre.

Put simply, these two fights side-by-side are like a super well-choreographed fight in an action film versus a real fight in the UFC \[Octagon\]. Both are good but you can feel the legitimacy in performance in one versus the other and I'd be lying if I said that Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin had more heft in its combat over Obi-Wan Vs. Vader.

I'm not saying one fight is better than the other. I'm purely stating that 1) I like Obi-Wan Vs. Vader more than Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin, and 2) Obi-Wan Vs. Vader feels like the better fight in terms of its deliverance on a fight \[to the death\] and what it truly means for two combatants to be fighting to kill each other. Obi-Wan Vs. Vader VS Obi-Wan Vs. Anakin: 'The Combat'"
starwars,"from what i can tell, with all the medichlorian counts and force powers on display, vader was the prophecised chosen one because he tossed a guy down a vent? please someone correct me. chosen one?"
starwars,"As a collector of star wars dvds, I've been waiting for the past 2 years for s7 of the clone wars DVD or even a complete series boxset yet nothing I'm getting very worried I may never be able to get DVD/blue ray versions because they just don't want to make dvds for them which saddens me quite a bit if that's the case has Disney announced when a complete boxset for any of the Disney plus shows coming out"
starwars,"I didn't mind it so much in the original trilogy, but I really hated how empty everything felt in the sequel trilogy, with everything beingremote ""out nowhere""-planets other than a very few select areas like the horseback area in The Last Jedi. Meanwhile, I absolutely loved all the huge cities and civilized areas in the prequel trilogy. 

My favourite video game levels have also been the ones set in cities or areas with civilisation. Do you prefer the ""desolate"" environments of the original and sequel trilogy or ""civilised"" one of the prequels?"
starwars, [QUESTION] How would a fight go down between Vader and palpatine?
starwars,"And there's a scene in the Jedi Temple where Yoda tells Kenobi that Anakin has become Vader.

So why doesn't Obi Wan know who Vader is in his TV series? Did he not know Vader still existed during his time on Tatooine? I just rewatched Revenge of the Sith..."
starwars,"I didn't read legends and I didn't play any of those KotOR type games. 

But the Inquisitors in the Obi show were constantly bickering, constantly establishing a heirarchy, constantly wanting to be the ""grand"" inquisitor, and basically just acted like a bunch of power hungry children doing what they coudl behind each others back to gain power/favor. 

Is this why the rule of 2 was started in general? Because darkside force users can't help themselves to betray each other? How the inquisitors acted in Obi Show: Is this how Dark Siders were pre rule of 2?"
starwars,"A trilogy where there are better lightsaber duels, and the prequels/clone wars are acknowledged more? I know we think Disney’s ruining the current Star Wars product, but would you like to see this? I know I would. Should the Original Trilogy be remade?"
starwars,"Eye hope nobody has posted this theory before. Eye have watched the first 30 minutes of episode 4( I don’t like old movies, they’re cheesy and look fake, I usually just read about the plot) and have watched all of
Mando and just finished the obi wan show (well I just watch the last episode of each season and look up the rest on Wikipedia, I’m very busy with my online MMA classes and my medical sales job, doctors can’t sell medication directly bust since I’m not a doctor I’m allowed to! People are so appreciative sometimes they get even more than the recommended dosage, but eye like helping people, so eye make sure they get what they need) and Eye realised that both characteres, have the same last name. The galaxy is so big they might have upwards of a bilion people, so having the same last name as another person seems pretty rare. They also both Cary the same color glowing spear thing, and they seem to where similar attire. There first names are different, which is evidence that contradickts my theorey, but eye wonder if maybe he just decided to go bye a more normal name (Obi-Wan is a pretty stupid name). What do you guys think?

Edit: sorry for my bad English, eye was born usa and lived there the first 20 minutes of my life but after living in Finland for so long I have had to submerse myself in their language, I have forgotten much of my original language. Theory: Ewan McGregor and Alec Guinness play the same character."
starwars,"Hi guys,

I am looking for a canonical star wars book to read. I have only watched Star Wars content until now and think it has passed time to go deeper into the universe.

What would you guys suggest to me? Book recommendations for someone who has only watched movies and series"
starwars,"I’m looking to buy a necklace with a Jedi order symbol on it, or something of a similar nature and wondering does anyone know of any particular stores that do this. As I can’t find much to my liking online. Jedi order necklace"
starwars,"


So she said that due to the Rouge Squadron movie's release date being delayed due to creative differences, there might be a chance that Taika Watiti's Star Wars film, which was originally supposed to be released in late 2025, might take Rouge Squadron's release date and be released in late 2023 (2 years earlier).

My question is that, I don't remember production for Taika's movie starting, or even actors being casted, then how the hell is he supposed to complete the project by late 2023?

Won't this mean that it'll be super rushed, and the chances of faliure would increase significantly?


And since some rumours also suggest that Disney plan to begin a new series of films from the universe which will be established in Taika's movie, so shouldn't that mean they should be extra careful regarding Taika's movie? So at the 2022 Star Wars celebration, Kathleen Kennedy said about Taika Watiti's upcoming movie that..."
starwars,"Where would I find somewhere to watch (preferably online) a copy of a New Hope that hadn't had any of the CGI edits?

I mean completely as it would have been when first released How would I watch an original cut of Episode IV?"
starwars,"Especially as we've seen that serious injuries can be overcome through the use of mods (Fennec Shand for example, and even Reva herself). 

Why is it so hard to accept that a stab in the torso, that is cauterised (so no bleeding) is survivable, but Anakin dipping his stubs in lava and having his entire body set on fire is perfectly acceptable? Why are people mad about Reva surviving a stab when Anakin literally bathed in lava?"
starwars,"Obi Wan did it to Anakin at the end of RotS and spent ten years believing that he was dead. Obviously he intended for him to die. But he didn't, and it turned out that the crazy, powerful, Jedi-hunting Sith Lord terrorising the galaxy was Anakin.

Lesson learnt? Nope, he does the exact same thing again, leaving Anakin to continue his reign of terror despite knowing what he has become. Anything that Vader does now is particularly Obi Wan's responsibility.

Anakin buried Obi Wan in rocks and left him to die. He was winning the fight, and if he had just checked that Obi Wan was actually dead he could have done so. But no, he allowed Obi Wan the chance to escape and sneak up on him. He then lost the fight and could have been killed.

Reva stabbed the Grand Inquisitor in exactly the same way she was stabbed as a child and survived. She knew that it was possible to survive such a wound, whether through dark side powers or not, so she really should have made sure that she followed through. Leaving him alice ended up being part of her undoing.

I'm not sure if Anakin really intended to Kill Reva the second time or not, but leaving her alive almost inadvertently led to the death of the son he didn't yet know he had. If she had gone through with the murder of Luke, and if she had told him about it (which I assume she would, otherwise it's a pretty pathetic revenge) then he would have regretted not killing her properly.

I know it looks cool to dramatically walk away from somebody on the floor... But really? One thing I picked up from the series is that people need to stop injuring others and then leaving them for dead. If you haven't watched them die, they're probably not dead."
starwars,I remember it had a part where Luke is flying in space and his ship explodes and it describes in detail how messed up he is. It's implied he's dead. Then later it turns out he force healed himself or something and comes back. It was an EU book probably from before or around the time the prequels came out. Remember hearing it on audiobook. Thanks! What EU book was this in? (probably around or before the prequels came out) (minor EU spoilers)
starwars,"I still think Reva's path was way too telegraphed and I predicted how it would go after episode 2.. and the first 4 episodes had some pretty egregious errors and lazy mistakes, but man... Episodes 5/6. Wow, pretty unbelievable, carried a lot of emotional weight and made the first 4 worth it. My opinion of the show has improved by a great deal. As someone who was critical of episodes 1-4. episodes 5-6 of Kenobi were pretty great."
starwars,"My mom and I want to watch the Kenobi series, should we watch something else first or can it be seen relatively blindly? We only watched the movies, and I a bit of Clone Wars and Rebels, too.

I plan to watch the other shows anyway as well, mom not. What should we watch before watching the Kenobi Show?"
starwars,"Hi guys , I'm new to star wars universe...
Can you guys guide me to the best watch order for Star wars ....  Thanks in advance best watch order with every shows include."
starwars,"Can anybody recommend some Star Wars literature for a 10-year-old? He's seen all of the films, some of the animated series (mostly The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch) and, most recently, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 

I don't think it matters too much if it's been de-canonized by later Disney properties. 

He recently tried Light of the Jedi by Charles Soule but I think he found it a little difficult. 

Thank you! Good books/graphic novels for a young Padawan?"
starwars,"it’s clear now Kenobi let Vader live only to one day train HIS SON to kill him

he didn’t have the guts to do it, he let a Sith lord free to roam the galaxy killing hundreds of innocent beings

and he expected Luke to eventually do this job for him

I ask you, how could you be okay with those screenwriters having butchered Kenobi’s character? do you even consider him a hero anymore? [SPOILERS] how do you all feel about the state of Obi-Wan’s character now?"
starwars,In the obi-wan show was it possible that Starkiller came in any given point of the show. I have only watched the movies and shows that know the tip of star wars lore and stuff. I don't know if this is some parallel universe stuff. Quick question regarding the timeline of Ben
starwars,"let me expleain i love starwars but i adore the tragic history of anakin skywalker, so how about a series about the event of the precuels and ot if qui gon train and guide anakin as shuld been, obi wan keep his best friend , the joy of raise his kids with the love of his life still with him, the villain can be anybody i dont care even dark yoda lol, but i serius belive that they deserve much love every one does, ofc wuld be non canon, or maybe another universe/timeline where the duel with maul go the other way. anakin. live his live as slave in his entire existence, that dosenst seem Fair... so well that i know the existence of white vader but it dont do anything for me, so what do u think? do u like to see a more happy history?  
pd: sry for my english is not my first! i want to see a happy life for anakin"
starwars,"So I was rewatching Kenobi and I noticed a stark similarity between the way that Reva carries Luke out of the Dune Sea and the way Anakin carried his mother. I started to think about it and I believe it’s meant to contrast Anakin’s fall to the dark side beginning with the need for vengeance for his family, while Luke’s story begins with the forgiveness and restraint shown by Reva for her’s. Not sure if this was on purpose but it is really cool if so. Dune Sea (Kenobi Spoiler)"
starwars,"And then probably some new characters Im thinking of a name ""Hans hollow"" or ""zue backa"" and by the end They'd all be together to fight Vader again on his own base. Would be emotional too if Vader kills Kenobi. I wish in Kenobi season two we would see Leia and Luke grown up and meet again with Kenobi"
starwars,Upvote the comment you agree with most. Don’t downvote comments you disagree with. Let’s settle this once and for all. Vote so we can figure out the consensus on Kenobi.
starwars,"SPOILERS AHEAD.

First of all, loved the episode. But I had some questions.  
In the beginning of the episode, Obi Wan takes the shuttle and flies off to the planet to draw the Star Destroyer away from the rebel transport. Vader demands that they follow Obi Wan, then he takes his own shuttle and lands for the whole fight scene. 

First of all, this didn't make sense to me. Why couldn't Vader have followed Obi Wan while the Star Destroyer continued following the rebel transport? Why didn't they deploy multiple tie-fighters to handle either ship?

Anyway, after the fight Obi Wan gets on his shuttle and flies off the planet (presumably straight to Tatooine). Next time we see Vader, he's on Mustafar. But what happened to the Star Destroyer? Was it in orbit around the planet while Obi Wan and Vader fought? How did it miss Obi Wan flying away? Wouldn't they have been tracking Obi Wan's ship?

Maybe I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief and say that Obi Wan flew to the other side of the planet where the Star Destroyer couldn't see him or something? Or did I miss something?

I feel like I had to suspend my disbelief quite a bit throughout the entire season, to be honest. It's fine, I guess. I liked the show. I just wonder why there was such a critical mass of head-scratchers. Question About Obi Wan Kenobi Finale"

starwars,"I’ve noticed that Luminara’s mummified body was left without becoming one with the force, as well as the multiple bodies shown in the tomb in the Kenobi series. Were those Jedi not deserving or worthy to become one with the force, or is this just an oversight? Why did Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda’s body vanish almost instantly after death, but most of the Jedi who were killed in order 66 didn’t vanish immediately, if not at all?"
starwars,"If one wanted to get as much flavor for Anakin's story as possible, his training with Kenobi, life with Padme, his transformation to the dark side, and into his life as Vader what all material would you recommend? Regardless of canon or not and regardless of medium (books, comics, animated, all). Very much enjoyed Kenobi series and have watched all the movies. Thanks Interested in Anakin/Vader material"
starwars,"Qui Gon's appearance in the finale of Kenobi was amazing but it raises a question for me. I had this understanding of canon, but maybe I just made it up so hoping someone can confirm or deny.

 I was under the impression that Qui Gon died before he learnt to force project him self. He was only able to project his voice which is how he trained Yoda, and provided the additional training for the full projection, though he could not apply it himself since being dead.

Did Disney skip over this or is it my head canon? Am I making this up?"

starwars,"I really think its my favorite SW movie since Revenge of the Sith. Kenobi used similar elements from the game and I feel it had a great antagonist with a interesting backstory. 

You can just watched the cut scenes that total nearly 2 hours or you can watch it with in game dialogue to help improve the understanding of said cutscenes a bit better which has a 3 1/2 - 4 hour runtime. I get if you're hesitant, I was also since I had never watch a game as a movie, but give it a shot for a few minutes because it might surprise you.

starwars,SE1 EP6 of the Obi Wan Series was the greatest star wars film since Revenge of the Sith. Obi Wan: Season 1 Episode 6 the GOAT

Also I remember that yoda in the prequel trilogy states how the Jedi have lost their way during the clone wars so what was their original way? What was the original purpose of the Jedi?"
starwars,"So I’m watching all Star Wars for a 2 or 3 time and I actually think that ahsoka cares more about Anakin than padme, like she actually is willing to die for here and always tries to help him but padme is  more focus on the job and she give up on anakin when she fall to to dark side but ahsoka don’t, this makes me think that the family love is more strong that pair loves.
What do you think? I little though I have about ahsoka"

starwars,"Hi guys, long time SW fan, i’m just getting into reading a lot of the books now that i inherited some and i had a question none of my family seem to know.

Are there other or separate groups based around the force that aren’t Jedi or follow Jedi rules. Like there has to be, right? It make sense that another planet or civilization was also built around the “Force” but their version. Any pointers on books or articles to check out helps, thank u! Different kinds of Force religions?"
starwars,"So, after watching the show… I actually liked Reva. Not gonna say she’s my favorite Star Wars character, but I like her arc and even before episode 5 I liked the fact that she was a very active inquisitor who seemed to actually apply plans which had reason to work. Then during episode 5 it feels like she has a lot better motivations, and her letting go of revenge in episode 6 was a nice way to conclude her arc.

Though using Leia as bait was a bit more far fetched and at times, and it did feel like she had plot armor at times as well.

I think another problem was the show she’s in. A lot of people came to Obi-wan Kenobi to see… well Obi-wan and Vader. With Reva she’s a new character who fans will see as taking screen time away from Obi-wan and Vader, which she kinda did.

I like Reva’s story and her motivations are kinda cool and unique from the other inquisitors. But I feel like she would’ve been better received in another show. Thoughts on Reva?"
starwars,"Other than Obi-Wan, Rex, Palps, and maybe Ashoka, I’d have to imagine that Yoda was probably the next to discover Anakin’s feelings for Padme but I’m unclear as to when he made the realization? 

It’s been a couple years since I’ve watched the Clone Wars so I’m not sure if it’s mentioned there but I’m pretty sure with all his wisdom, clouded though it may have been, Yoda must have sensed what was going on prior to ROTS. What do you think? When did Yoda find about Anakin’s relationship with Padme?"
starwars,"That final dialog between Obi-Wan and Vader. It´s flawless, almost hypontic, I can´t stop watching it. Ewan and Hayden did an outstanding job. I´m strugling comparing with other iconic scenes, probably ESB ""No, I am your father"" and ROTJ with Anakin´s redemption are up there too, but this scene has something special Top 3 scenes in StarWars..."
starwars,"As Han Solo describes it, Luke's torpedo was ""one shot in a million"". When Obi-Wan famously  instructs Luke to use the force and switch off his targeting computer, could it be that he did so, so that he could guide the torpedo into the exhaust port himself?

We know from the sequel trilogy that force ghosts can use their power in the physical realm, in the same way a living Jedi can, such as for moving objects. Obi Wan alludes to this himself in Empire Strikes Back when he says ""if you face Vader, you do so alone, I cannot interfere"", which could also mean that he's ""interfered"" before and is now choosing not to

This is not to try to discredit Luke, it appears that just communicating with a force ghost required a great aptitude with the force and training, so the fact he could do so immediately shows the raw power he possessed without any training Theory: did the force ghost of Obi Wan destroy the first Death Star?"
starwars,"I just found it funny in this series we had multiple lightsaber stab attacks, with even one character being stabbed twice and no one died from it. Why couldn't they nerf the stab attack before Maul stabbed Qui Gon? Do stab wounds no longer kill?"
starwars,"I think this would be incredible, and it could work as a more action-light, personal tale. Plus, I don't think there's any of us that could say with a straight face we don't want more older, bearded Luke. I truly hope they make an Obi-Wan style prequel series staring Mark Hamill as a mature Luke set a little prior to The Force Awakens"
starwars,"Before I get into it, I just want to say that I enjoyed the show. I loved seeing Ewan and Hayden on screen again and the fight between Obi Wan and Anakin was awesome. The split open mask and the voice changing was incredible. I enjoyed little Leia and Tarla. I would always rather to have a show of this caliber than to not have the show at all. But I do wish this show could have been something more.

I was talking with my buddy and he pointed out that the biggest fault of this show is that nothing substantively happened. In large part Obi Wan and Vader remain the same. They largely are the people they are in the OT- I didn't find my understanding of them changed. Perhaps Obi Wan is more clearly sorry for what happened to Anakin, Padme and Luke and Leia, but we already know that in ROTS. There are allusions to how the Galactic Empire will react to kidnapping of a senator's daughter, or if Sidious finds Vader's attachment to his former master an issue, but nothing comes of it in the show.  

A lot of people gawked at the nuance added by Anakin saying Vader killed Anakin, not Obi Wan. Or that Obi Wan called him Darth. That is all stuff we knew, stuff that the happy accident of George retconning a little bit. The brevity of the OT is and has been understood that Obi Wan did not want to reveal to Luke that Vader was his father. Was it cool, yes. Did it change what we knew, no. 

Obi Wan's situation has not changed whatsoever. He's still on Tatooine, Leia and Luke are still safe, we confirm that he does actually connect with Qui Gon, which we already knew. He's still on the run from Vader. We learn how he reconnects with the force, but we knew he was connected to the force to begin with in ANH, so this show is basically just introducing that he disconnected from the force. Its very similar to how Luke is portrayed in TLJ, with the key difference being the viewer already knows where Obi Wan is going to end up. The mystery of what will happen is not as suspended as when Luke force projects to fight Kylo Ren.

Vader is still searching for Obi Wan. He's still Vader. At best we got a conversation about where his loyalties lie, which I would assume would have been a question prior given that both of them knew Obi Wan still lived. Obviously Obi Wan can't tell Vader about his children, but they don't even mention Padme, surely there might be some unresolved issues given their last meeting. Just spitting a hypothetical here, I'm not a writer.

I know that this show would have been tricky to write otherwise. It would be hard to have these character interact, somehow neither Vader or Obi Wan kill each other, but the issue still stands. The biggest change is that Reva, a new character, is no longer an inquisitor and is now free so to speak. Everyone else returns to life as it was.

Perhaps my favorite moment is when Obi Wan learns Anakin survived and became Vader. Which was awesome and an incredible scene. It will be one of the main takeaways for me, but I do not think it is substantive, even if it is powerfully emotional. 

As a Star Wars fan of almost 30 years, I have always loved the OT and its storytelling. It has surprising twist and turns that change the ball game. After watching Obi Wan, I do not feel like I learned or can expand much on my understanding of Obi Wan or Vader in the OT. He's the same. We get a bit more of how it happened, but compare that to (incoming mando/boba fett spoilers) &gt;!what we learn about Luke's temple when Grogu chooses to leave and return to Din. We know luke's temple fails but now we see that he was having trouble finding students who were committed to learning to become a jedi. !&lt; 

At any rate, I loved the show, but I just wanted to share my thoughts because I hadn't seen it posted. As always, feel free to disagree, that is a pillar of our community :)

tl;dr- I feel that substantively nothing changed for Obi Wan or Vader [SPOILERS] My Biggest Problem with Obi Wan Kenobi"
starwars,From DV to Maul to that poor Tatooinean Reva unceremoniously amputated How come in SW medicine it's easier to substitute a prosthetic robotic artificial limb than reattach the original?
starwars,"Once in Attack of the Clones while fighting Count Dooku, once in Revenge of the Sith while fighting Obi-Wan on Mustafar (may have spelt that wrong) where all his limbs were cut off and one more time in Return of the Jedi when Luke cut off his hand. Poor man can’t keep an arm. How many times did Anakin Skywalker get his right hand cut off?"
starwars,"Except as a child, Anakin was prideful, narcissistic, and jealous. He never improved or evolved.

His transition to the dark side was inevitable, and the Jedi were fools.

Basically, Anakin was always bad, and his only redeeming action was to throw Palpatine down a hole. Hot take: Anakin was never kind / caring / loving. He was a narcissist."
starwars,"Stormtroopers was originally meant to be so accurate in ANH, they blew everybody in the opening, Obi-Wan said ""only a stormtroopers can be that accurate"", then they shoot inaccurate cuz they were ordered to (which requires more accuracy); then in TESB where they beat a whole army of rebels in no time... And to andor which they did a really good job!
So... What happened?

it's just they put the protagonists among the stormtroopers and make them ran away with there skins to shaw us how lucky and heroic they were to beat all the (most accurate guys in the galaxy)... And yeah they just liked that idea so they start to repeat it over and over 'til they made my stormboys look like a joke... Like if there's no other way to ran away! 

Also Disney really have no idea how to deal with this or what to do so they just made it again and again in: rebels, the mandalorian, bobf, Obi-Wan Kenobi, their entire 5 movies, comics... Etc

Soooo yup, that's it... Stormboy forever!

I’d love to see him and Chewie have adventures on the Millennium Falcon, meet Jabba the Hutt, have special guest stars Emilia Clarke and Donald Glover from time to time, maybe see some more Crimson Dawn etc Solo and the Wookie tv series"
starwars,"I do wonder if Obi-Wan got a little force boost from the planet he lands on in his duel with Vader. Yes, he seems to have his mojo back, but is there a chance some of his power gain is from the environment? Is this Tython or another similar world strong with The Force? Which planet was the final Kenobi duel on?"
starwars,"I seriously don’t understand why there’s so much hate towards it. Sure it’s definitely got flaws but I don’t see why so many people have a straight up hate boner for it. The story was interesting, the action was amazing, most of the new characters were fun and likeable, and whenever obi wan and vader/anakin shared screen time it always felt emotional. I also thought young leia was pretty good and the girl who played her did a great job. I thought the third sisters story was very interesting, and while i’m not the biggest fan of the character the idea of a youngling survivor of operation nightfall joining the enquistors just to hunt down vader. I thought Owen and Beru were great and seeing them actually do stuff was nice. I thought it was at the very least a fun watch and it makes me a little sad knowing so many people think it’s terrible Why do so many people hate the kenobi series?"
starwars,"First off there are a lot of good things to say about the Obi-Wan show. It had a lot of good action scenes, brought back memorable characters, and featured Vader in his prime. However, the show in no way explored Obi-Wan as a character the way The Mandalorian or the Book of Boba fleshed out their titular characters. Instead it was mostly focused on Young Leia, which in my opinion was entirely disappointing.

The show paints Obi-Wan as a boring character whose sole purpose is to refight Anakin Skywalker in the form of Darth Vader. His only story arch is that he has been disconnected from the force which we as an audience have seen 2 times before already in Star Wars as well as in Spider-Man 2 with Tobey Maguire where his powers fade because he stops caring about being Spider-Man. Boring.

Ewan Mcgregor’s acting abilities were severly underutilized because his character did not grow. He just returned to the character he always was. Meanwhile Young Leia takes the stage and talks like Young Sheldon, with a technical savvy to match that we never saw in later movies.

I’m hoping if there is a second season Disney will actually focus on Obi-Wan as a character rather than forcefully trying to turn Leia into a Disney Princess with the goal of selling merchandise. Until then, The Mandalorian will be a vastly superior show that feels much more like Star Wars than the Obi-Wan series. The Obi-Wan show was more about Young Leia than Obi-Wan"

starwars,"TL;DR:  &gt;!Porkins is Snoke.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Jek Tono Porkins was a rebel pilot who participated in the final assault on the first Death Star. Very heavy from a young age, he was nicknamed ""Piggy"" and ""Belly Runner"". Always angry at being called out for being overweight, Porkins was, in turn, well known in the Rebel ranks for gleefully hazing new recruits.

Porkins seemingly perished when his X-wing fighter was shot down by a TIE fighter. His fighter, engulfed in flame, crashed on the surface of the Death Star, which would be destroyed by Luke Skywalker mere minutes later.

...

Porkins awoke, surrounded by hooded figures with medical instruments.  
""Quick, he is awake!"" they scrambled.  
The survivor instinctively lifted his hand and the group of hooded figures began to float upwards, choking. ""Where am I? Who are you!?"" the survivor demanded.  
""You are on the planet Exegol, deep within the Unknown Regions,"" one of the figures managed to say. ""We have kept you alive.""  
Porkins slowly loosened his grip on the floating figures and let them touch the ground again. ""How long?""  
""It has been more than a decade. Tell us, powerful one, whom do you hate enough to have survived this long?""  
""The Rebellion! Skywalker!"" he hissed.

...

The hooded men explained what had happened. After the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial Navy investigated the debris field and found one piece of the Death Star curiously untouched. On this piece of debris, the wreckage of an X-wing fighter still contained one badly burnt survivor clinging onto life. His uniform provided his name: Jek Tono Porkins. Initially placing him in a bacta tank to heal him for later interrogation, the Emperor quickly began to suspect that Porkins's survival was no accident, but somehow connected to the Force. The Emperor was intrigued and asked the survivor be fully healed.

The healing process of Porkins was peculiar, however; he would begin to heal, only to rapidly deteriorate, in an endless cycle. The Imperial scientists continued to study the case of Porkins. They eventually discovered a correlation: Porkins would only heal up to the point of his body being able to physically process the provided intravenous sustenance. As adipose deposits began to emerge on his body, however, he would begin to deteriorate until they were depleted again. They could not understand the underlying mechanism of this pattern.

As the Empire fell, the Porkins laboratory was secretly moved to Exegol, where the project was taken over by the Sith Eternal. Ever hoping to understand the Force better in an effort to bring back their master, the scientific understanding of the Force by the Sith Eternal finally provided the missing link in the investigation. Porkins had an abnormally high midichlorian count and could replenish the midichlorians rapidly, but as his weight increased, while the concentration of midichlorians in his core tissues would remain mostly the same, the midichlorian concentration in his adipose deposits was far below expected. They concluded that as Porkins gained more and more weight, his apparent Force sensitivity would decrease, a result of Porkins unconsciously using his connection to the Force to keep his body functional far beyond the point when his unnaturally high weight should have caused an early death.

When Porkins's X-wing was shot down, the cockpit became engulfed in flame, which swiftly began to destroy huge portions of his adipose tissue. Burning in the cockpit, the loss of adipose tissues allowed Porkins to begin calling more and more consciously on the Force to keep himself alive, until, finally, Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star. At that moment, the nascent Force potential and the latent dark side tendencies of Porkins found focus in his rage at being so casually abandoned to burn to death by the Rebellion and Luke Skywalker's decision to destroy the Death Star instead of attempting to save him.

After their discovery of Porkins's unique midichlorian distribution, the Sith Eternal started a new avenue of treatment. As adipose deposits, with their minute midichlorian presence, began to form on his body, they would be surgically removed, allowing the core tissues of Porkins to continue to heal after years of stagnation. They soon discovered this approach to have an additional benefit: the adipose tissues removed from Porkins were a living, growing source of tissue that still had some concentration of midichlorians after removal, no matter how minute. This tissue could not only be used as a basis for creating clones of Porkins that would be Force sensitive, but, when properly processed, they could be grafted onto the cloned body of Darth Sidious, at which point the midichlorians present would diffuse throughout it. Subsequently, the Porkins tissue would be removed, having fulfilled its role as, essentially, a midichlorian transfusion.

The Sith Eternal systematically removed Porkins's adipose tissue as it emerged. It was an arduous process and it took months before Porkins's core organs would be healed enough to allow him out of the bacta tank. It would take even longer to have a sufficient amount of Porkins's adipose deposits to fully empower the clone body of Darth Sidious, though that process eventually became faster as Porkins clones began to supply more and more of the required material.

Porkins, of course, fully submerged in the Dark Side, was not very interested in the mechanics of his survival. He only wished to have revenge on the Rebellion and Skywalker.

The Sith Eternal were all too happy to provide an opportunity, having finally found a perfect leader for the first phase of their plan: Porkins was extremely powerful with the Force, was familiar with the tactics of the Rebellion, and was wholly committed to their destruction, most of all Skywalker and his new Jedi.

Porkins was warned that he should never gain weight in order not to lose his conscious connection to the Force, which he took to heart, remaining unnaturally thin, almost corpse-like, for the remainder of his days.

Before taking full control of the First Order, Porkins elected to choose a new name. He would no longer be Jek Tono Porkins, ""Piggy"", ""Belly Runner"", the laughing stock of the Rebellion. He was the opposite of that pathetic fool now. He first reversed his name into SNikrop Onot KEj and then shortened it. From this point onward, he would be known as Snoke. Jek Porkins lives"

starwars,"I've spent the past 6 months listening to the Thrawn Acendency and Thrawn trilogy books and I was blown away! I never thought I'd enjoy listening to an audio book but I was seriously shocked at how easy it was to be transported into the Star Wars universe, and how excited i was to switch it on everyday. 
Marc Thompson did an awesome job!

Can anyone point me in the direction of the next best Star Wars books I should listen too. I'd appreciate it if your suggestions are in the current Canon realm but not fussed if they aren't (little overwhelming with how many books there are). 

For those who haven't listen to these books, I highly recommend you give it a go. I personally started with the Acendecy books first then went into the next 3. Even though they were written first (classic Star Wars...) Thrawn (Canon) Audio books finished, absolutely loved them. But where to from here?"
starwars,"Now that we have Obi Wan and Vader canonically meeting before the events of ANH, Obi-Wan calling Vader “Darth” can be viewed almost as a snide comment. New meaning in Ep 4"
starwars,"So i rewatched the scene in Kenobi episode 6 and I noticed something with the lighting. When the line “I am not your failure, Obi-Wan. You didn’t kill Anakin Skywalker, I did” is said his face is bathed in blue, making his eyes look like their original brown. I could be stretching but to me this felt like Anakin truly reached out to Obi-Wan and genuinely wanted to let him know that his fall was not his fault and knowing that after that they wouldn’t see each other until the events of Episode 4 is truly one of my favourite head canons because it means the last time Obi-Wan and Anakin saw each other they made peace and gained closure. Again I could be stretching a bit but I love the thought of it. What does everyone else think? Obi-wan Kenobi Episode 6"

starwars,"Obviously Vader killing Kenobi led Luke to seek out Yoda, but what if Obi-Wan’s plan was much more devious than that? What if Kenobi allowed Vader to kill him with the purpose of becoming a force ghost and haunting his former pupil? Even after years of hunting his former master and best friend down and finally killing him, he’s still haunted by Obi-Wan, constantly hearing him put doubts in his head. Feeding him information like that Luke is his son only to have his spy network confirm it and just enough information for Luke to turn Vader back to the light side in his final moments. Plus how else would Vader have known about the existence of force ghosts? What if Ben Kenobi’s surrender was actually his greatest weapon?"
starwars,"THEY SUCK,the only good movie was episode 3

episode 1:

\-boring,no action,Jarjar,bad story,no good dialogue

\-one good fight scene

There is no need for this movie at alllllll,we didn‘t need to see young Anakin

They could have easily told us in episode 2 how Kenobi once had a master and how he was the main reason to free Anakin and telling Kenobi to become his master just before he died

2/10

episode 2:

\-maybe the worst story,stupid dialogue but I gotta say the last act saved the movie

There is not so much to say but a better movie than ep.2

4/10

episode 3:

This movie saved the trilogy from destroying the merchandise

\-There is not so many bad things to say about this movie but Anakin‘s turn makes no sense here‘s why:

he turned to the dark side to save Padmé , he loved her so much to the point where he betrayed his friends and mentors just to save a potential threat on her life so when she tells him to stop he fucking murders her WTF

so the only thing that he wanted from his turn is to save her so after she‘s dead he just continues to be Darth Vader and btw the way Palpatine „convinced“ him to join him was..bad let‘ say

But the story is good,the dialogue is better and the action is also really good

7-8/10 

Yoda is the most consistent character in the whole franchise imo,he‘s the one of the best parts of every movie he is in,I‘m really glad to see them handling this iconic character in this way

These prequels ruined Darth Vader a lil bit for me bcz .. well I‘m not the biggest Anakin fan I actually didn‘t like him in any of those movies and when I’m gonna rewatch the OT again,it will always be Anakin under a mask for me + he serves a fucking lunatic..OMG I hate Palpatine so much.

5/10 trilogy for me Just watched the prequels and …"
starwars,"RE: Episode 6;

That was a star destroyer, it must have had a hundred small ships, and probably dozens of medium-sized ships that could have out-run and destroyed that transport ship, easily.

I know it was probably done for plot reasons, but there is no logical in-universe reason why Vader, however  emotional he was, would not have at least let The Grand Inquisitor, or some other ships go after the rebels, especially considering the atrocities he committed in the past, and that Vader was going to be the only one to face everyone, so at that time there was no reason The Grand Inquisitor couldn't go and do something else...

However,

I would also add to Ewan's comments and voice my own about how sad and frustrating it is to hear that even in 2022, people are heckling actors online simply for the colour of their skin. It's pathetic, and there is no reason for it, they never was, and they never will be.

There's no excuse, and I hope that we can get to a point in the future very soon, where so few people choose to be that way, that even those who are remaining and screaming out for no reason, can eventually be silenced by society with an overwhelming majority of equality.

May the force be with all who seek to preserve the hard work and bravery of those who stand up to these small-minded parasites. Vader used a shuttle, but didn't send anyone after the rebels?"
starwars,I’m in! At 38 years old. Just watched my first Star Wars film.. hello!
starwars,"This has bothered me since I saw Attack of the Clones in theaters. When Obi-wan says something, I can only hear one single phrase, but the phrase makes **absolutely no sense** in the context of the scene. Further, I just turned on closed caption to see what is actually said, and it showed exactly what I hear. But I know this isn't right, so...

When Obi-wan leave Tan Wei on Kamino and is walking towards his ship to send a holo message to Yoda and Windu, he says, ""R4, send a message to Coruscant \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_.""

What I hear, and what I have always heard in the space of those blanks is, ""... care of the old folks home."" I promise you, this is what Disney+'s CC just showed me, but I know he is not directing his droid to charge ""the old folks home"" for his holo message.

Even though darth vader is considered to be stronger with the force then palpatine.
my question is, how? Darth Vader stronger then palpatine?"
starwars,"Honestly, I’ve always seen this as a missed opportunity. I know it’s nearly impossible to have Leia appear in any live action shows/movies now that Carrie Fisher is no longer with us, unless they recast Leia, or use CGI which I don’t know how the fandom would take it. But I would love to see a moment where Leia gets to speak with Anakin’s ghost. I’m not saying she has to forgive him or anything, he did torture her and destroy her planet, so she has a right to hate him even if he did redeem himself. Regardless of how that conversation goes, I feel like we need it to happen in order to close that chapter of the Skywalker family. 

Now, I know Leia wasn’t originally supposed to be Luke’s sister, so I understand why there’s a lack of interaction between her and Vader in the originals. But why haven’t there been any comics, or books about it? All we’ve had are a few hints here and there. I feel like that’s something we really need to see. Anyone else feel that way? Leia should have gotten more interactions with Vader/Anakin"

Well I still have all my childhood toys and I’m going to be meeting Anthony Daniels in August. My brother thinks it would be cool to get it signed and I think so too… but we can’t find it.


I don’t think it was a full scale replica it or anything like that. It wasn’t very big but it was a good size probably about the palm of my hand. It was metallic gold and it came in a pink and purple box I believe. I know it had a barcode on the bottom because I remember looking it up on eBay (I liked doing that when I was a kid) 

It had a black stand with a ball joint, and a bit of the neck but no shoulders. It’s eye lit up and it did not make any sound

Is Obi Wan watchable on its own?"
starwars,"the child in mando is 50 years old and has not developed past infancy. when yoda passes away, he is roughly 900 years old (“when 900 years old you reach, not as good you will look, hm?”). yoda should be comparable to an 18 year old human by 900 years, but he looks like an elder by phantom menace (roughly 864) 

yaddle was 483 in tpm, but already looked over the hump as well, albeit not as far as yoda. we could call yaddle middle age while being fairly generous. 

this would mean that the species advances through childhood, teenage, and adulthood in roughly 300 years, but can survive almost  3 times as long as an elder.

starwars,"During the conversation at the end of the fight between Obi-Wan and Vader, we get two little easter eggs.

1) Vader pointedly says that he killed Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi later repeats this to Luke in IV. This neatly ties up the fact that Lucas had not yet decided (during the making of IV) who Vader would be. This line became a sticking point in later movies, such that they had to have Obi-Wan retcon it onscreen for Luke in Episode VI.

2) In IV, Kenobi referred to Vader as ""Darth"" during their saber duel on the Death Star. It's often been remarked that Kenobi's use of that as a name in IV seemed not to track with him knowing who Vader actually is. Now we get to see him consciously make the decision to use that name to acknowledge his friend's death.

I'm not sure either of these were necessary, but it was still neat that they did them. Last episode of Obi-Wan tying together Episode IV and later movies"

There is no way that she could've connected Anakin and Luke from a busted hologram message. No ONE other than Bail, Owen/Beru, Yoda and Obi Wan know who Luke is. Not even Palpatine knew this.

Then you can say , he was connected to Obi Wan somehow and she wanted to harm luke for revenge to Obi Wan. If you use that reasoning then everything in episode 5 made no sense.

 In episode 5 her true motivation was Vader. Obi Wan handed Vader to her on a platter and she failed. From that point forward logically there should be no ill will towards Obi Wan. He did what she truly wanted so her actions toward him are null and void.

 He proved he was on her side yet she goes after Luke for what? It just makes no sense at all the motivation behind even writing this plot in episode 6. Can someone PLEASE explain Reva in Episode 6?"

Anakin is still the Chosen One and he will bring balance to the force. 
But NOT by destroying the Sith, but by destroying Abeloth.

Who is Abeloth you may ask? She is a legends character. Before Disney bought Star Wars, Abeloth was the embodiment of pure evil in the Star Wars universe. She also has a connection to the Mortis gods.

Something I didn’t realize until watching part 5 with my wife. 


My wife is a perfect example of what I imagine the average Star Wars fan is like. Seen all the movies, knows a good bit of lore, and has had some exposure to the EU. 

When we were watching the final scene where Vader storms in and pulls apart the transport ship, my wife literally gasped. She couldn’t believe Vader could pull a thrusting ship down to crash and rip it apart like a lion on the Savannah. Meanwhile I’m just Iike “yeah, that’s Vader.

This show STEALS, and yes STEALS from other well written Star Wars content, Jedi Fallen Order plot of sneaking in the same exact way in the Inquisitor fortress, Vader helmet cut scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin from Rebels which was written by Filoni, and for some reason they reference the Last Jedi of all movies with a Chase scene after a tiny ass transport ship yet AGAIN Damaged with no hyperdrive. WHILE NOT USING TIE-FIGHERS? Which they also didn't use in the Fortress.

&amp;nbsp;

Reused the ""I'm Totally a bad guy"" Plot from Battlefront 2, but oh wait I'm a good guy now.

So Reva murdered people as an inquisitor, including Jedi, HANGED the Jedi in the town square for all to see and probably murdered kids along the way, but she can't kill 1 boy of the person who massacred her friends? while surviving 2 stab wounds in the gut?


""but shes dark side she can survive lol""


okay last minute she's good now, so we should assume she just dies now right? moronic. 

&amp;nbsp;

These writers don't know Star Wars, there are some great and amazing scenes in the show, but this show was like a bumpy road, lots of ups but even more downs.

&amp;nbsp;

Fans keep praising the good in the show, and overlooking hard on the bad, and most of it is bad. Letting them make shows with horrible writing like this show the lack of care for the franchise. They will keep doing it, the only 2 people I trust to write coherent shit is Dave and Jon at this point.

&amp;nbsp;

Hayden and Ewan carrying bad writing as usual, its like poetry, it rhymes! Stop hiring writers with no history of writing good Star Wars"
starwars,"I REALLLLLLYYYYYYY feel like a Darth Bane TV series would be AMAZING.  The first book alone for Darth Bane is so captivating.  The amount of lore we would receive is IMMENSE, the saber battles AMAZING, and the force abilities....MIND BLOWING ( for any of you who get that joke, I love you).  Sure it would be a darker tv series, probably rated R.  But we would get a look into how the Brotherhood of Darkness ran things.  Essentially the sith version of the jedi order during episodes 1-3. a tv series about the man who created the rule of 2 would be EPIC.  Easily one of my favorite sith lords Darth Bane TV Series"
starwars,"What I mean is that it is likely space colonization began tens of thousands of years before Star Wars takes place.  Therefore, could many of these aliens just be humans who have changed due to adaptations from having lived on alien worlds for so many generations?
That may explain why so many look so human. Do you think it's possible many of the ""aliens"" we see in Star Wars are not really aliens."
starwars,"For me, I didn't even realize who Anakin and Palpatine were in the original trilogy until the second half of Episode 3... Imagine my shock lol

In my defense though, I grew up in China and heard that this Star Wars thing was pretty big in the West so I just started watching them in the order they came out without realizing Episode 1-3 were prequels to 4-6. Also my English wasn't that good back then so I had to rely on the Chinese subtitles, but the translation of the names were not consistent across the movies, so I missed some pretty obvious clues.

Anyone had a similar story? What big plots went over your head during your first viewing of the movies?"
starwars,I can’t remember if ol’ sheevy was ever referred to as Sidious in the original trilogy. Just as the emperor. Is there a point in the movies where his sith title was revealed at all or am I just being an idiot? Where in the original trilogy is the emperor referred to as darth sidious?
starwars,"One of thing I love about the Obi-Wan series is what they did with Vader. First off  they made him absolutely terrifying and powerful. It's so satisfying to see him go toe to toe with Obi-Wan and with style. 

The second thing they did was they connected Vader and Anakin for me. I've always seen them as two separate people. Once he put on that helmet in
 Revenge of the sith, Anakin was gone and Vader was born. But this series I was constantly thinking ""that's Anakin in that suit. Some of these decisions he is making are based on the Anakin from the prequels"", and it was so well done. 

That final Obi-Wan!!! From Vader on the last episode gave me chills and has quickly risen to be in my top 5 Star Wars moments of all time. One of the best things about The Obi-Wan series is Vader"
starwars,"It’s important I don’t screw this up. They’re brand new. Dinner and movie night with a Star Wars VIRGIN! Episode 4, right?"
starwars,"Been thinking about getting into Star Wars after playing battlefront 2, what can I watch it on and what should I start with?

starwars,"https://postimg.cc/zVM7kvLc

years and years I didnt understand it. 

I thought it was some fuck up in editing. how the hell did luke get there on the stairs?

its simply a shot that doesnt show the definition of the crane with the low lighting. its basically splitting the composition with the crane in the middle. 

silly me. its just a soldier there. took me forever to realize this shot"
starwars,"Kenobi ended up being a solid series and while there were some things I liked and some I didn’t, the thing that bothered me the most was the shitty camera shaking. It is literally like the memes about someone filming a school fight lol. 

I think it made fights harder to completely follow. I think it also made the whole show look less professional and I cannot see any intentional, good reason. It also made the show feel less like the other Star Wars content, which was jarring for me. 

It could have made sense if the camera was shaky up until the point Kenobi was strong again. This would make the viewer feel less grounded, relating with Kenobi when he lost his way. Then at the end of the show, when he finds his way, the camera becomes strong and focused. But obviously that did not happen. Did you guys notice this? What did you guys think? Cinematography of Kenobi"
starwars,I’ve never played a Star Wars game with lightsaber mechanics as immersive as these games… praying to the Star Wars gods to make another!!! They really need to make another Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy game
starwars,"At the very end we see that Kanen and Hera have a kid.

When was it implied the intimaye moment happened? I thought all they got was a scene where they said they loved each other and kissed. Spoilers question about Rebels."
starwars,"When Reva reveals Anakin is alive, it shouldn't have shocked Obi-Wan. He should already know Anakin is Darth Vader when he sees Vader Killing younglings. Link here: https://youtu.be/-S0CE9yAjWs Kenobi/Vader Plot Hole"
starwars,"I love the characters, and the nitty gritty lore and details about the factions (jedi, the empire, republic, etc). I don’t particularly care about majority of the movies though. Does anyone else feel the same way?

It’s weird how an animated tv show called the clone wars made me love the characters more then the 3 movies, especially Anakin. Does anyone else like the Star wars universe and its lore more then the movies?"
starwars,"What's the difference in adavantage that Kenobi had over Anakin, that allowed him to disable Anakin when Anakin tried to overcome the ""low ground"" disadvantage he had on the lava shores of Mustafa. Compared to the ""low ground"" disadvantage Kenobi was under when hanging from his finger-tips at the feet of Maul; Only then to leap in the air and to a flip over Maul's head and slice Maul in two? 

Bpth manouvers seemed very similar, and I would even go as far as saying the low ground disadvantage Kenobi had was greater than that of Anakin's. 

Not  only did Kenobi have to leap from his fingertip's, he also had to flip over Maul's head in a much sharper arc than Anakin had to, and at the same time force grab his saber from a distance. 

Can anyone link me to some source material which breaksdown the comparison of the two events? Why didn't Darth Maul know about ""The High Ground""?"
starwars,"Looking at getting into one of these. Which one should I read, or should I read both? Charles Soule or Greg Pak; which Darth Vader comic is better?"

starwars,"while they do release contents and spin offs, sequels to the original star wars lore. 

Star Wars can copy how Gundam survived through out the years and thats releasing another gundam series without any connection to the original.

Gundam though still release Universal Century Movies and Series but never failed to give new series as well.

I think Star Wars can do that as well if they really think about it. 

Star Wars Visions, i think is a glimpse of that. Star Wars Franchise can do Gundam Approach"
starwars,"Even tho I mostly liked the 6th episode despite to its mistakes, I still can't understand some things... there are simply too problematic.   


So Reva survived a lightsaber stab TWICE? None of them makes sense, but the first one happened to her when she was only a youngling, which means that even if she would suddenly turn to the dark side for power, she was not even close to be as a strong force user as she would be in order to survive. She wasn't Maul or Anakin who were both exceptional force users and fighters, filled with extreme hatred, and both of them used the dark side before their injuries.   


The second stab makes a bit more sense (let's say that Reva's hatred kept her alive"", but even Maul needed help and Anakin needed artifical libs and systems... the force itself wouldn't be enough to fuel their bodies forever. They still needed some kind of medical help.   


Also, HOW the hell could Reva NOT just get up after that stab, leaving the rebel's base, get healed, and find a terribly fast ship, but she was able to reach tatooine FASTER than Kenobi? It starts to remind me to the last seasons of Game of Thrones where people just travelled through epic distances and it seemed that they did this over a very short period of time.   


This is the second time Reva does something this: previously when Obi Wan, Tala and Leia were running away in a tunnel, she didn't even know about that secret place and even then, she found it, and NOT only catched uo to Leia, but finished the road twice as fast, killed the pilot, and even had time to get comfortable and wait for the girl...   


Am I missing something in these cases, or this is just bad writing? Reva's teleportation powers and survival [Ep 3 and Ep 6]"
starwars,Just finished Obi Wan .. I'm thinking about watching everything Star Wars in time line order. I never watched any of the animated series or Book of Boba. Where can I get a resource to see everything ever produced and in the correct order. Thanks... Official timeline?
starwars,"As far as soldiers go. Clone Troopers were bred from childhood to be killing machines made for one purpose, to fight hordes of Battle droids, like your modern US marines apart from that, there's not much to know since Palpatine kept their true nature under wraps, hailing them as white knights and heroes of the Republic. But if you are a threat they won't hesitate to put a bolt between your forehead even if you are a senator, good soldiers follow orders.

Stormtroopers on the other hand are your average citizens wanting to defend the galaxy, with the promise they get to see the galaxy and fill the gap of the Empire's war machines. Inferior to clones with the lack of superior training and, their bad tenancy to miss their shots often. But at least you know they are enlisted. 

Which trooper do you fear most? Who would you fear most? A clone trooper or Stormtrooper?"
starwars,"So, Obi Wan knows Anakin is Vader. He saw it on the security footage and Yoda tells him Anakin has been ""consumed by Darth Vader"". The only thing he didn't know after ROTS was that Vader was still alive.

Does this mean we are supposed to believe Obi Wan never heard anything about Vader during his 10 years on Tattooine? But he's aware of his Inquisitors?

Additionally, Bail Organa, who has a direct link to Obi Wan, is very active in the Senate which would be very aware of Vader's presence. Why did he never think to let Obi Wan know? Vader is a direct threat to him and greatly endangers Luke and Leia. You'd think he would want to know Question regarding Kenobi's ""realization"" during episode 2"
starwars,"As the title says, I'm looking for a top-down view of the Scarif base, showing where all the islands are and how far from the Citadel they are.

I was going to use [these](https://imgur.com/a/Q0CXdKh) images to try and sketch my own, but wanted to see if one already existed.

I'm planning on building the whole base in Minecraft and I would like it as accurate as possible. Does a top-down schematic of the entire Scarif base exist?"
starwars,"I know peo0le want to say Anakin,Yoda or Mace but I think it's Obi-Wan and this is why. Okay Obi-Wan defeated General Grievous which many other Jedi failed to do. Then Obi-Wan defeats Anakin on Mustafar. Also looking at the clones wars series he fought Maul and Savage 1v2 and came out on top as well as his fight with Darth Maul in episode 1 ending in Mauls defeat. Then he finished Maul in rebels in an instant. Now we have the final fight in the Kenobi series which has him defeat Vader once again and to strengthen the argument Vader has been training under sidious for quite some time at this point and has killed many Jedi. I'd love to hear your takes is Obi-Wan the strongest Jedi. Obi-Wan is the strongest Jedi"
starwars,So against my own judgement I finally watch episode 9 and it actually physically angers me that this is considered a good star wars film or considered a proper ending. This movie was so bad and full of shit that makes literally ZERO sense. Can someone please tell me why they like this lump of shit Angry
starwars,"i told my bf he’s the obi wan for me and he really loved that, so i want to find a cute star wars inspired pet name to call him. the only issue is i don’t know anything about star wars!!! thank y’all! what are some cute star wars inspired nicknames i can call my partner?"
starwars,"Ep 7-9 claim to be part of the Skywalker Saga but leave out the most important character. I understand  that The Force Awakens takes place many years after but the story is still focused on Anakin's family. I was disappointed after each sequel movie when he didn't show up and after watching the obi wan series that feeling is renewed. I have not been on Star Wars discussion boards since 2019 because the last sequel film dampened my interest in SW until Obi Wan came out. 

The sequels felt like they were trying hard to distance themselves from the prequels, with Obi Wan it feels like the writers care about this being one connected saga. Anakin should have appeared in the sequels"
starwars,"Considering how much time passed between the release of RoTJ and the Phantom Menace and considering how much EU content was released between the OT and the Prequels, surely there are some depictions of what a young Anakin outside the Vader suit would look like. When I googled it I only found one picture.

Does anyone have some comic appearances, book covers, or just random fanart that shows this? Thanks in advance :-) Looking for depictions of Anakin from before the prequels"
starwars,"Hi everyone, total Star Wars newbie here! Really want to start watching but totally lost on where to start. Noob - Tips needed!"
starwars,"The spoiler here is that during the finale of Obi-Wan Kenobi season one, we see force ghost Qui-Gon Jinn. Now, we can speculate that this will likely lead to some form of training between the two so that Obi-Wan can learn more about the force and eventually be able to become a force ghost himself once he passes on.

I think one of these lessons could be through a vision where Obi-Wan’s mind is opened to the possibility of what would have happened if Darth Vader beat him on Mustafar. Something about learning through the fate of darker outcomes, and placing the universe’s perspective on a much greater scale. 

Anyway, having visions in Star Wars that predict the future or show alternate timelines is nothing new, but I think this concept would be fascinating. It could show how powerful Darth Vader could have become, not being limited by his injuries and suit. It could show just how scary or menacing he would be in a unique way different from suited Darth Vader, eventually overthrowing Darth Sidious as Emperor. I imagine this vision could mostly take place in the same timeframe the Kenobi episode is set in, just in an alternate timeline.

Is this like a pilot episode to an eventual ""What If...?: Star Wars Edition""? Maybe. The possibilities are endless. An idea that I had for a future Obi-Wan Kenobi episode that shows Darth Vader at his lost full potential"
starwars,Ezra pulls her out of the fight with vader and then she escapes from palpatine through the portal and she ends up back on malachor. Does she end up there at the same time as Ezra is destroying the tample and all in season 4 or does she end up there basically around the time he pulled her out of the fight with vader which is the end of season 2? Does anyone know? It's confusing. So I have a question about the time traveling thing from rebels season 4
starwars," 

This is an attempt to plot out what George Lucas' Episode VII could've looked out. I've fully fleshed out the plot description as best as I can, sticking as close to the information of what it would've looked like available to me. There will be contentious things in here, ""Uber"" character morphing from Maul and into an entity less person within the story, so I've taken a few creative decisions on things like that with a wider plan on how I think it could've work based on some of George's other comments about a ""micro biotic world"" and what ""uber"" would fit that person best.

Below is a link to the Plot Description and below that is a bit of a timeline of key events that make up the backstory. Not all the answers are there purposely as they would be expanded upon in Episode VIII.

Let me know what you think. I am considering drawing storyboards for this all the way through if feedback is positive. George Lucas' Episode VII Vision"
starwars,"Me and my friend have been questioning this topic for like 2 hours now
Do you think it's Anakin? Rey? Luke? Or someone else? Who do you think is the chosen one?"
starwars,"So yeah basically the title Reva is just a retread of Starkiller from legends. They are both Jedi younglings spared by Vader then taken in by him to be trained in the ways of the darkside, who are then ""murdered"" by him. They both  then go against there training in an attempt to redeem themselves. While I personally am not a fan of Reva or that her entire arc is based on a character I much prefer I will say I feel the backlash is undeserved and I think Moses Ingram did a great job with what she was given I just feel that Reva's arc was slightly underdeveloped. 

I do wonder if the backlash would have been this bad if the show had instead opted to just use Galen Merek instead of Reva.

I do hope that there use of the broadstrokes of Galen's story doesn't rule out a future appearance of the character as I feel he may be the most popular legends character that isn't post OT era to not be canonised so far. Reva is Starkiller"
starwars,"You know Solo was actually the first Star Wars movie I saw in cinema I thought it was good critics however didn’t, the problem with Solo is that Harrison Ford couldn’t play Han Solo and instead we got someone who looked nothing like younger Harrison Ford I would recommend Solo to an ot fan, even though a Han Solo origin story movie is not needed but it’s not as bad as the sequels i’d say it’s as good as rogue one. I’m not arguing against any points that were why it was bad I’m instead going to say a few reasons why I liked it.
— The Falcon —
The millennium falcon is one of the most iconic if not the most iconic starships in Star Wars and I think having the escape pod where the gap on the falcon is makes sense. Although the plans for the falcon say that it’s on where the cockpit is, it’s never used and still Han could’ve modified it. There’s 10 years between the final scene and a new hope Han has time.
— Lando —
Ok this may be a little controversial but Lando in this movie looks like a younger version of Lando from the empire strikes back. If you disagree with me then fuss over it in the comments. Now Landon’s character is pretty much kept in Solo, he’s still a  dick so there. I never liked Lando tbh because he was such a scumbag even to his own friends. However this movie made Lando a more likeable character imo him hating Han and hell even cheating to keep his ship made him seem a lot more protective now rebels shows he learned his lesson but still I think I like this version more.
— plot —
There’s a lot more plot in solo than the sequels it makes sense as the ot and pt also had a strong plot. The plot makes sense and Han starting the rebel alliance makes sense too I never considered Han to be an antihero apart from in ANH and this movie makes him seem like a hero thinking he was a villain instead of an antihero.

In conclusion I think that solo should have been a book (yes ik of the Han Solo books in legends apparently it’s quite accurate to them I haven’t read them I can’t sat) but still it’s a good movie it shows Han Solo works as a protagonist, however Harrison Ford is irreplaceable as Han Solo, it flopped, I also think that it would’ve been better as a animated movie/tv series I would recommend it to any ot/Han Solo fan. It does not wreak the character. (Controversial opinion) Solo is a good movie held back by the time it was written"
starwars,"I’ve binged watched Kenobi over the last two days and felt a little confused.

I’m not sure where I heard it (or even if I heard it at all) but wasn’t it said that Vader was never able to find Kenobi in the time between ROTS and a New Hope?

I’m probably wrong but can someone just clarify that for me. Help me understand something."
starwars,"I noticed that in the series, Vader usually refers to him ‘Kenobi’ like ‘Kenobi is all that matters now’ , or ‘Kenobi means nothing. However when Anakin is shining through a little bit like after their fight, he refers to him as ‘obi-wan’, which is what Anakin always called him in the prequels because of how close they were. This made me a little bit more emotional because it highlights his conflict even more. Detail about Vader in Obi-wan Kenobi"
starwars,"just curious if anyone has a rough idea how much of the fan base is men vs women?

Im guessing substantially more men? fan base percentage men vs women?"
starwars,"The Skywalker Saga is being bled dry at the moment and we need something new. Apart from the High Republic books, every new content in the past 10 years has taken place in the same 60-year period. Side-characters without character are being given whole shows, every new content seems to spend half its time being a conveyor belt of backdoor pilots and cameos of the same 20-odd characters (looking at you Mando S2).

Alongside this, with the exception of a couple shows and films, the majority of content has been thematically weak, i couldn't for the life of me tell you what the overall message of Boba Fett or Kenobi was, what was the point of the story they were trying to tell? Boba Fett almost had something with the Tuskens and the theme of finding a family and purpose after years of solitude, but dropped this after a couple of episodes in favour of Mando S2.5. Kenobi could've been a really introspective series about the force, religion, and Kenobi's PTSD, even though the latter was touched upon throughout the series it was often pushed to the side in favour of yet another lone wolf and cub story, and whatever the hell they were trying to do with Reva (child murder is bad was her development??).

These weaknesses are coupled with the fact that we know what's going to happen to most of the characters. However cool the last fight was, we know Kenobi and Vader aren't going to die or get seriously injured like in ROTS; we know Leia is going to get back safe; we know Reva isn't going to kill Luke, Owen or Beru. By making every new story happen between already established stories the stakes are severely depleted and the potential for compelling storytelling is diminished. The Skywalker Saga worked because whilst it was a family drama, it also had galaxy spanning stakes. Anakin's fall led to the fall of the Republic and rise of the Empire, and his redemption toppled the Empire and brought about the return of the Jedi. Yet by sticking to this time frame, nothing of significance can really happen, Boba Fett was limited to creating a galactic crime syndicate consisting of one town.

What Star Wars needs is to stop beating the dead horse of the Skywalker Saga and move onto a new saga unrelated to any pre-established characters. Personally I would love for a trilogy of films covering the early days of the Jedi and the birth of the Sith, it would have the potential to tell a deeply thematic story and also have galaxy-spanning stakes. We'd be able to see the Jedi and Republic in their infancy, the first Jedi to fall to the dark side, the creation of the Sith, how their everlasting conflict was created, maybe even show how the prophecy of the Chosen One came about. We'd also be able to get new planets, species, ships, droids, aesthetics completely detached from previous designs (IMO sounds better than the 100th TIE Fighter or variation of a Stormtrooper helmet).

Star Wars used to be full of imagination and wonder, yet it has regressed into repeating the same tropes and stories ad nauseum, with it only surviving on nostalgia at this point. I really hope Lucasfilm starts to move past the Skywalker Saga and into more creatively rewarding stories, otherwise I really don't think there's much left for me anymore. Star Wars needs a new saga urgently."
starwars,"I don't like the artistic decision, especially in the new Obi-Wan series, to have the lightsabers emit SO MUCH light, even in bright lighting conditions. Even though it's supposed to look more realistic, it bothers me. It always feels like people holding an LED tube in their hands (which of course they are). In a strange way, it destroys the immersion for me.

Don't get me wrong, on paper I like the idea and I'm glad technology caught up, but they should definitely dial it back.

What do you guys think? Lightsabers emitting too much light in Obi-Wan"
starwars,"Personally I loved that they explored different planets as well as give an in depth of kenobi's guilt. Reva was an interesting character imo and I am curious what they'll do with her should they decide to use her more in the future. Let's spread some positively for the weekend, what did you like about Obi wan Kenobi?"
starwars,"The game is old (probably more than 7 years)

I remember when I was little watching a starwars game walkthrough and at one point the dude fights a big giant with a metal plate protecting a wound in his head, he kills him by breaking the metal plate and hitting the would with his lightsaber Looking for a starwars game which name I forgot"

starwars,What was the planet called where Vader and Kenobi fight in episode 6? Spoiler question for episode 6 Kenobi
starwars,"Ezra Bridger should be more appreciated, he has a very special set of abilities not seen anywhere else in the Star Wars Universe, what makes him so special and powerful is that he has nothing to lose, he's no chosen one and he doesn't come from a powerful family...

Before he was found, all he ever wanted was to survive and be left alone; he's one of the really good guys once he is trained and despite all his flaws, arrogance and slips with the Dark Side.

*spoiler

He even saved Ahsoka from a certain death and introduced what's the closest to time travel in the Star Wars Universe... he doesn't get the praise he should get... I'm really looking forward to seeing him pop up in the new TV shows to finally get the recognition he deserves Why Ezra is underrated"
starwars,"A lot of the discourse on this page seems to be about what people *don't* like. Sometimes it feels like that old trope ""nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans"" is true.


So, for people who don't like Kenobi, Mando, Fett, the Sequels, Prequels, OT or whatever....what do you you actually enjoy about Star Wars? What's your favourite media? Era? Characters? What Star Wars do people actually enjoy?"
starwars,"I've been searching everywhere for either physical or digital copies of the movies that include Arabic subtitles. None of my Blu-ray copies have it and neither does Disney+. From what I've gathered, people have watched the films with Arabic subtitles before but I have no clue where they found them. Any info would help massively. Star Wars with Arabic Subtitles?"
starwars,"Darth Vader was cool once, but he's now milked to such an extent that it's becoming extremely tiresome and honestly plain boring. How many more times di we have to fall back on Vader in a movie or show to make it somewhat interesting? 

Kylo Ren was somewhat interesting as a character (or at least started out as such), but sadly suffered from those badly written movies in which they had no real plan for him ( or any of the characters really). Plus, I rather not have someone related to the original cast again. 

How about they introduce some new Sith already?  The Star Wars lore/history is filled with interesting and imposing Sith, but we always go back to the same worn out dude in black.   
I personally think it could give the entire franchise a boost if they finally introduced a new Sith lord and apprentice. Unpopular opinion: It's time to retire Vader and introduce some new Sith characters already."
starwars,"I normally have a hard time understanding politics in clone wars, but this is the one time I just can’t figure it out no matter how much I look it up. Nix was corrupt, so why would he want palpatine in control of the banks? For me, it would only make sense if he knew he was darth sidious, but he doesn’t. Can someone please explain? Thank you. Why did Nix Card give control of the Banking Clan to Palpatine?"
starwars,"While the Rebels are my favorite faction, and I don't really like people unironically saying the Empire did nothing wrong (wow, I'm offended that someone likes the bad guys in a movie, how pathetic am I, oh right I'm a Star Wars fan, the answer is yes) I will admit the OT really should've shown more of the Empire's Villainy. Other than Alderaan, the Lars homestead, and Cloud City, the majority of their actions can be somewhat justified as simply trying to get rid of an insurrectionist group. I guess this is why I feel like they should've made a series in between the releases of ANH and TESB, so we could get more of that, in other words, once more Star Wars shows it works better as a TV series than a movie Series. Something I noticed in the OT"
starwars,"Have the show begin with a time skip, just between episodes 4-5. Reva has begun helping smuggle force sensitive children away from the empire as a “masked jedi vigilante”, but specifically without a lightsaber, instead spending her free time meditating, since her anger and vaders strength with the force gave him the upper hand. At the end of episode one I want their to be another confrontation with Vader. He still bests her, but he isn’t there to kill her. He has learned from Boba fett the identity of the pilot who destroyed the death star is his son, and that the emperor lied to him about his wifes death. Just like in the comics with darth vader and doctor Aphra, he is attempting to recruit Reva as one of many allies against the emperor. It was his plan for him and luke to tule together originally, and the comics show how much he hates the emperor, he cracked the glass of a star destroyer when he found out he had a son and thought of the emperors lies. Would be an interesting dynamic. Would also love to see an inquisitor saber with cleansed white crystals. 

Feel free to let me know how much you hate it and what you would like to see if they do the rumored Reva spinoff. Honestly though Obi-Wan was pretty good, the parts I liked outweighed whatever I didn’t at least. Reva story idea"
starwars,"Am I the only one that's actually sick of hearing the force theme every two minutes. Imperial March would've gotten old being played with Vader every time he shows up as well. Great music but a lot of it was so overplayed in the sequels that I couldn't be happier with this less is more approach. It should be saved for the right moments, and that is exactly what the Obi Wan show did. It saved the Imperial March for that final Vader moment and it was all the more rewarding for it.

The point is, Star Wars music is so iconic at this point that hearing a repeated track actually takes me out of the show. Instead of it enhancing the scene I'm just kind of listening to the music. And if its played constantly like the Force Theme in the Sequel trilogy I eventually start rolling my eyes.

I was glad that the Obi Wan show opted to do its own music, it shows restraint not to rely on constant nostalgia trips by not blasting the old stuff over every scene. Online everyone's going, ""Why didn't they play the Order 66 theme when Reva fought Vader"" or ""Why didn't they play Battle of the Heroes during the rematch."" Uh, maybe because it would be super on the nose.

Sometimes less is more. I don't want to hear the force theme every time something vaguely force related happens. Use it to hint at the force perhaps but it doesn't need to happen when Obi Wan lifts a bunch of rocks, nor does Battle of the Heroes need to happen every time Vader and Obi Wan get in a fight.

While we're on the subject I've also heard a lot of ridiculous stuff like, I thought this was the Obi Wan show not the Reva show. Oh God forbid a show have other significant characters in it that aren't Obi Wan. Its still very clearly Obi Wan's show, his journey, his arc. 

I won't deny, Obi Wan had some very sloppy writing to the point where I still can't decide whether I like this show. It has some incredible moments and a lot of really stupid ones. But most people aren't complaining about the writing as much as they do about Reva or the soundtrack. 

I honestly couldn't understand people's problem with Reva. The most consistent thing I hear is the acting but I don't understand that either. I've seen worse acting from Mark Hamil yet everyone worships Luke Skywalker. She's a well rounded character with clear motivations. At least until the end where she thinks she'll get back at Vader by going after the son he doesn't even know about, but she's not exactly the most rational person. I'm tired of people bitching about the Obi Wan soundtrack"
starwars,"I can’t screenshot it because Disney+ won’t let me but in the first episode when obi wan returns to the cave, we see a scanner pop out of the sand and it’s the exact same as R2s. How come he didn’t make an appearance? So is that not R2 outside obi wans cave in the sand?"
starwars,"
I want to get my first custom saber.but i can only use shopeepay or touch n go ewallet or boost.is there any good saber vendor that accept these ewallet? Does Sabertrio accept these ewallet as payment method? Is there a vendor that accept shopeepay?"
starwars,"Seems like the writers are trying to suggest that Vader's conflicted feelings over Obi Wan held him back a bit based on Palpatine's comment at the end. But this doesn't jibe with established lore about how the dark side works.

The dark side is fueled by hatred. And Vader's hatred for Kenobi is so intense that he should have been hulking out during his duel with Kenobi no? But Kenobi still outperformed him with the lightsaber and in the use of force powers.

So did Kenobi's connection to the force somehow deepen during his time on Tatooine? Seems pretty unlikely that Vader was having second thoughts about killing his former master. After watching Kenobi, do you think Obi Wan is more powerful than Vader?"
starwars,"I've always assumed that the force had something to do with it, that anything with the ability to process information would have the force flowing through it filling it with the same connection that flows through all other living things and making it so that the processing of that information creates emotions within the droids in the same way learning about the world creates emotions in a child that define its view on the world.

But then l realized that there's probably some kind of book or video game or poster or back of a box of cereal that already exists that just firmly explains why droids have personalities. Are droids programmed to have personalities or do they naturally develop them?"
starwars,"This entire series has massive plot holes and inconsistencies. To name just a few:

Leia running from 3 adults that cannot catch her. Then from Obi Wan on the roofs. How hard could it be to ourun a 10 year old? Not to mention going past Organa's security etc

E5 close range shootout between rebels and troopers is hilarious. You see troopers going down and only 1-2 rebels. This should have been a masacre of the rebels that are untrained and poorly equiped but still manage to kill more troopers than lose 

E6 plot holes: Reva is left for dead by Vader. Then she just walks away, finds a ship (from were?) flyes to Tatooine and arrives on Tatooine city in the morning. Meanwhile a whole star destroyer cannot catch or kill the rebel ship. They forgot about the tractor beam apparently. So the few minutes/ hours the ships chase eachother is enough for Reva to travel to Tatooine.
Then she waits for the night because a sith cannot kill a boy in daylight. 

Then Obi Wan and Vader find another place that could support life and face eachother. Then Obi refuses to kill Vader for whatever reason... Then Obi senses Luke is in danger and arrives on Tatooine instantly just in time to see Reva carring a 10 yo boy for hundreds of meters with a lightsaber hole in her gut.

This logic failures and plot holes for me kill any positive the series has. Sorry for bad English, its not my first language. It was like seeing S8 of GOT again. Unpopular opinion: Obi Wan series, specially E6 is very poorly written"
starwars,"It seemed like, in the last episode, uncle owen gave third sister the business while defending his family. When she attacks the farm. Anyone else see that? Did Owen grab 3rd sister in the crotch?"
starwars,"On his birth certificate, passports, general IDs, what did he have documented for his name? Anakin Skywalker? Did he spend a day changing all of his stuff if not? or did he have his goons do it? What name did Darth Vader use for ID?"
starwars,"Personally I would choose

1: The crystal arc: Fun banter between Anakin and Obi-Wan, foreshadowing of the death star

2: Dark Disciple: Obvious choice, as it is the conclusion of Ventress's arc

3: Yoda's adventures on Kashyyk: I need to see Yoda passing the blunt with some Wookie friends

4: Yuuzhan Vong: As someone whos favourite era of Star Wars is the post ROTJ EU, this would be a dream of mine. Plus the whole description of the episode having a creepy X-Files feel to it sounds really cool

5: Son of Dathomir: Another obvious choice, it would make a hell of a season finale; Continuing Maul's arc, giving some rare character development to Palpatine, wrapping up Talzin's arc and most importantly setting up season 7. I was genuinely surprised that this arc wasn't included in the final season given how vital its events are to the story You get to choose five of the Lost Arcs of TCW to make your ideal second last season of TCW"
starwars,"Episode 1 was decades ago

but with the Kenobi tv series bringing back nostalgia

I was wondering how others thought of Darth Maul's first appearance.

I saw episode 1 in the theaters when it first came out.  
I didn't think much in his first appearance in the desert.. other than that he had a light saber with a very long hilt.

But that fight later on when DM took on Obiwan and Quigon, that was awesome.  Especially the first time you saw the second light saber turn on, making it like a light staff.  That was so cool and a lot of people around me thought.. Wow.. i didn't know you could use a light saber in that way.

also Ray Park's athleticism and movement made the light saber fights in episodes 4-6 look stiff in comparison.  Of course, story wise, we know Vader is stronger.  but back then watching Darth Maul move about, made him seem like the strongest Star Wars villain at that time.

how were your reactions? what was your first reaction when you saw Darth Maul"
starwars,"With there being so many discussions and conversations going on in this Star Wars Reddit, who knows I could have missed this being talked about already, but my conversation is simple…. 

With the Obi-wan Kenobi series finished – What is the Machete Order now? Does it change or stay the same? Does the Machete Order only cover the movies, or is now the TV series added? Or is there a new “Order” to be put out there. Now what is the Machete Order?"
starwars,"Late I know but I've been away on holiday so I started to watch Kenobi last night made it to end of Ep 3. Its amazing and everything I could have wanted so far! 

Though something confused me - Reva tells Obi-Wan that Vader is still alive and he's shook to the core. Now what I don't get is this is 10 years after RoTS right? Yeah Obi-Wan has been hiding out being a hermit on Tatooine for that time but how would he not know Vader is alive? 10 years after RoTS this should be Vader prime time ruling no? Of course the way Anakin felt about sand makes it very unlikely Vader himself would go to Tatooine but even still he's a galaxy known sith lord so where was Vader for these 10 years? Did nobody on Tatooine know about him? 

Hoping they confirm a Vader series since the brilliant Hayden would love to carry on playing him, also hoping for a season 2 Kenobi but I haven't seen the ending yet, great news about a Yoda series being confirmed too! 2nd/3rd Ep of Kenobi"
starwars,"In light of Hayden Christensen seeing a revival with fans for coming back as Anakin Skywalker, one other actor who deserves redemption in the eyes of the fandom is Ahmed Best. The least the fandom (and Lucas owe him) is six episodes. And honestly, it could be modeled after something like Star Trek: Picard, Logan, or The Last Jedi as an older, wiser, more mature Jar Jar wrestles with his role in the fall of the Republic. How much was he manipulated, and how much did he actively choose the role? Watch the character struggle with deeply human, universal experiences of guilt, shame, grief, and regret as he tries to find new meaning in a galaxy gone mad. Hayden Christensen is getting a well-deserved resurgence of support from the Star Wars fandom. But he's not the only one who deserves it. There's one other character I'd like to see come back in a more serious, mature way: Jar Jar Binks."
starwars,"I've been playing a lot of Fallen Order recently and I noticed that the Jedi for the most part are seen very poorly through the public eye, which made me wonder: 
How did they explain Order 66 to the people across the galaxy? Did they say it was a preventive measure to stop a Jedi rebellion? Did they say the Jedi shot first? Did they even say anything at all or was it just like ""So this weird thing happened, btw we're your new leaders now so don't ask any questions or we'll kill you""? [Question] How did the Empire justify Order 66 to the general public?"
starwars,"Title. Been trying to get them to watch them or get excited for it but each time I do they make it seem like it’s a chore for them to watch or there has to be some kind of trade off for them to watch them. 

Feels bad but I guess it’s not for everyone. Guess I need to go out and make friends with people who are into it but that’s hard to do as an adult lmao. 

Sorry for my rant, just curious if y’all ever had to go through this. It sucks when your person isn’t into StarWars"
starwars,So good… I think the final scene with obi-wan and Vader was one of the most sincere and visceral SW moments on screen.

Ironically it’s my favorite of the sequel trilogy just for that lol Did anyone find Rise of Skywalker hilarious?"
starwars,"Hello all.  I’ve just started rewatching all the Star Wars movies and shows.  I’ve finished the prequels and was about to watch Solo when I looked up the chronological playlist.  

On it, there are many animated shows; Clone Wars, Rebels, Bad Batch, etc.  That said, I am REALLY not a fan of animated tv shows.  

Do these series add anything to the saga that I couldn’t get from the movies and live action series? Do the animated shows really add anything to the saga?"
starwars,"Hello r/StarWars ! 

So, I'm a longtime Star Wars fan, as much as a guy my age can be. I saw RoTS in theatres and before that had movie marathons with my family of the original trilogy. 

That said, the last few years of new Star Wars movies, shows, books, games, and other random source materials has gotten me more excited (And obviously, the new Obi Wan show!)   


Right now, I've really wanted to follow the Vader thread. Does anyone know what books or comics I can delve into to follow his story?   


Also, I would love recommendations for good Star Wars stories that you think any fan should read.   


Thanks! :) Where do I start?!"
starwars,"So, prior to Obi Wan Kenobi Episode 6 being released, I was pretty sure that we were going to get a Padme Amidala flashback from Vader's perspective. I figured Obi Wan would tell Vader that Padme saw good in him until the very end. 

Natalie Portman is already under contract with Disney to play the Mighty Thor in the upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder, and likely several sequel projects as well. Therefore, I figured it would be easy to bring her back to play Padme again. Alas, she didn't appear in the show in any way. 

But should she appear in the future? Should we see more of Padme's relationship with Anakin? Should we see further into her mindset regarding the Clone Wars (which she firmly opposed)? Could we see a show centered around Padme in between Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones? Should Padme Amidala appear in more Star Wars projects? (Obi Wan Episode 6 Spoilers!)"

starwars,"Is there a default lightsaber hilt design for Jedi? I mean, is there a default design that is common, and seen across most lightsabers that don't belong to any particular Jedi? Default lightsaber hilt design?"
starwars,"Why am I asking this? Well you see, when Darth is defeated and Obi-wan just leaves, he doesn’t stand up and for the kill, he just stays there calling him back. If he wanted to kill him so bad, he would’ve just gotten up and rushed for it, but he didn’t, he just sat there waiting for *something*. In Ghost of Tsushima (ps4 game) &gt;!Lord Shimura!&lt; wants a honorable death, and if you decide to walk away and not kill him, he won’t do nothing, he will just stay there kneeled, so when I compared both scenes, I found them oddly similar: did Vader want have a “honorable” death, maybe end his torment, or was he just in a lot of pain to move? Maybe I’m dead wrong, but that’s how I sensed it. Did Darth Vader want Obi wan to end him in the last battle of Kenobi?"
starwars,"I'm just a casual SW fan and I was wondering if there's an actual reason Vader has that (James Earl Jones') voice in canon?

Is it to sound more intimidating?

Does the breathing apparatus alter Anakin's voice under the helmet?

Will we see Anakin/Vader in Ahsoka? (I haven't watched anything other than the movies, ObiWan, and Mandalorian but I heard Ahsoka and Anakin have history)

Again it is a very silly question. I also ask because Vader was using both voices after Obi Wan defeated him in the show. It sounded cool. That scene was cool and I appreciate Hayden Christensen portraying Vader and partially revealing his face. Because under the helmet and in costume while having his lines voiced by someone else, it doesn't really matter who the actor playing Vader is. But the fact that Hayden was shown to do both was awesome.

One thing I would have liked to have seen is Vader struggling to breathe with his helmet broken. But I don't know all the details about his prior injuries. Silly question about Vader's voice."
starwars,"So I’m re-watching the finale of OBI-WAN KENOBI and I gotta ramble about the relationship between Palpatine and Vader… 

It blows my mind that Palpatine not only manipulated Anakin into trusting him, leading to Anakin’s fall to the dark side, but upon putting the suit on him, good ol’ Sheev outright tells Vader that his anger killed Padme. Without hesitation, and knowing full well that he had Vader completely under his influence, he said ""hey bud, I know I told you that the dark side who help you save Padme, but it actually killed her. Sucks eh? Wanna go build the Death Star now? AND VADER AGREED. BRO SCREAMED NO AND THEN FURTHER PLEDGED HIMSELF TO THE MAN WHO EFFECTIVELY CAUSED THE DOMINOS TO FALL THAT ENDED WITH PADME’S DEATH. And for the next 25 years or so, Vader acted like a good lap dog, following every command that Papa Palpatine gave him. 

I guess I find it interesting that Vader never outright tried to seek revenge on Palpatine. Maybe he knew he’d never succeed, or maybe his hate for himself was too strong to overcome, and Palpatine was the only person willing to stand by him, so he gave himself over to the dark side forever. I think it also shows how powerful the dark side can be when you have hate as strong Vader does. We obviously saw it in Maul, but Vader’s an entirely different beast. Maul was driven by revenge, Vader is driven by self-hatred. And in that self-hatred, he could never bring himself to break apart from Palpatine. The man who destroyed his world and everything he loved… he continues to stand by him. 

In short, I love this finale, and the relationship between Palpatine and Anakin/Vader will always be fascinating to me. 

***also apologies for any grammar mistakes. I’m writing this on mobile. The grip that Palpatine has on Vader is absolutely crazy"
starwars,"There has been a lot of talk of character (and actor) redemptions.

Anakin (Hayden) and Jar-Jar (Ahmed) but I want to see a Kaz (Christopher Sean) redemption. I always felt that character had potential that wasn’t probably realized.

What's funny is that Luke is literally trying to cancel the entire Jedi order, he's not interested in destroying a murderous enemy (the First Order), he's obsessed with deleting the knowledge and the memory of a group of heroes from the past, pretty much modern cancel culture. 

Didn't anyone try to explain Star Wars to Rian Johnson? Of all the people involved in the film surely someone realized how bad he got it wrong during the process? Luke literally wants to cancel the Jedi in Rian Johnson's awful film"

starwars,"Everybody on the entire planet knows the “I’m your father” line. So watching the OG trilogy first is pointless. It’s just stealing epic moments from the prequels. 

It’s a much better experience 1-6. You don’t know who will live and die. You don’t expect Anakin to turn cause guess what not many people whom haven’t watched Star Wars actually know he’s Vader.  

All the fights hold more weight. Then when you finally get to the OG trilogy you know Vader is Anakin and you see him as the broken man he is. You want him to be saved. Then when it finally happens &amp; you see his force ghost and it has a huge emotional impact on the viewer. Or you watch it out of order and you have the reactor saying who’s that guy.

In my opinion it’s time to move on. I grew up watching og trilogy. if I can accept watching the prequels first is best then so can the rest of gen x &amp; boomers. 

If you can give any good reasons why I’m wrong I’d love to hear it, but in my opinion the list of pros and cons are so in favour of 1-6 it’s not really a debate, but here I am so I’d love to know what you guys think. Why do People tell reactors to watch Star Wars out of order?"
starwars,"Just finished watching the show. I'm not dissapointed, this is more or less what I expected it to be like. 


There was alot of poor writing involved, plot-holes and illogical scenes that I'm sure have been thoroughly discussed. 


All I want to say is what a performance by Ewan Mcgregor. Goddamn, when he looked at Split-helm-Vader and his whole expression changed, from focused and determined to bewilderment as if he looked upon the young padawan that he trained, and said ; ""Anakin"" ... I'm not ashamed to say that I choked up, that was an amazing bit of acting and brought up alot of nostalgia. Ewan McGregor as always gives his all. Obi-Wan Kenobi"
starwars,"I’ve seen various discussions on Kenobi’s score, particularly earlier on during the show’s run, but haven’t heard too much since the finale was released.  Most of the reactions to the score have been very negative.  And of course, spoilers for the show are present. 

*A sidebar before I get into it too much, I just want to mention to not blame the composer for the use or lack of use of existing themes.  The composer is bringing about the desires of the production.  If they wanted existing Star Wars themes to be used, they would have been used.  ESPECIALLY on something like Star Wars, the composer isn’t going to get to just do what they want.  Not to mention, using existing music means getting clearance to do so (again, way outside of the scope of the composer on a production like this).  Not only that, but there were plenty of rumblings about issues behind the scenes for the production of Kenobi, especially regarding the score.  So don’t attack Holt over you not liking the choices that were made; it likely wasn’t ever her choice, and she’s a very competent composer who was in a bad position for this show no matter what.*  

&gt;!Back to it.  Up until the finale, no episodes had fully used any of the preexisting Star Wars themes for the series.  Some themes were certainly hinted at, particularly some material having an Imperial or Rebel leaning to them, but the themes were never directly quoted, even when they probably should have been as there were a number of scenes that really would have benefitted from The Force Theme and the Imperial March.  The show has been heavily reliant on the Kenobi theme that Williams wrote for the show, as well as a few new themes written by Holt for the show (Leia, Inquisitors, etc.).  !&lt;

&gt;!As the time went on, the themes became ever so slightly more present.  The opening of the finale was still going that route, with a modified version of some OT material.  And then we finally got three of the preexisting themes actually quoted fully in the final moments of resoution: Darth Vader’s theme, Leia’s theme, and the Force Theme.  This finally shows that their omission wasn’t somehow a glaring issue that had been overlooked, rather, a conscious choice.  !&lt;

&gt;!I can generally understand the justification for why we get them when we do.  We get Vader’s theme once he’s truly, fully, become Vader.  He’s no longer consumed by Kenobi, the last thing tying him to Anakin.  We get Leia’s theme when Kenobi finally sees her as more than just a little girl, but as the Princess Leia Organa.  And the Force theme is used when Kenobi has truly accepted his use of the force and realized he doesn’t need to be cutting himself off from it.  He finally means it when he says “may the force be with you”, and his ties to the force have finally been deepened instead of lessened.  !&lt;

&gt;!The impact of those themes in those moments was very strong, especially because of the lack of them previously.  It’s a bold move, especially for Star Wars, to take this approach.  I’m honestly still on the fence about if I really like it.  I’m a HUGE fan of the overly-thematic approach that Star Wars usually has and it’s truly my first love within film music.  A huge part of me wishes that the show had been using all of the legacy Star Wars themes from the outset and stuck to a John Williams-esque style of writing throughout.  But a part of me also appreciates that they’re trying new things and are working to move past being merely one version of Star Wars.  The future of Star Wars only exists if they’re willing to go outside the box and tell new stories in new ways in the universe, and this is a small part of that.  !&lt;

&gt;!Really, my biggest issues with the series are just that they didn’t bring in more legacy themes in the final episode specifically.  Qui-Gon’s theme should have appeared when he did.  Palpatine’s theme probably should have been used when he had his moment.  I would have loved a light, childlike, woodwind rendition of the main theme/Luke’s theme when Obi-Wan and Luke formally meet.  !&lt;

&gt;!The most grievous omission was not using Anakin vs. Obi-Wan when they dueled in this episode.  I’ve seen some fantastic edits of the scene on this subreddit and that’s what I wish we had gotten.  Had that moment been the first time we got preexisting themes in their fullness…the impact of that could honestly not be overstated.  It would have been phenomenal.  Instead we got a very mediocre piece that has faint echoes of the ideas in Anakin vs. Obi-wan, which was disappointing.  In that moment it should have been all or nothing…having gone the silent route would have been better than what we got.  !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!I’ve really only heard discourse around the score prior to the finale, and like I said, it was mostly negative.  I’m really curious about people’s thoughts now that their approach has been fully revealed and makes sense.  Do you like that they pushed back the use of the themes until the end?  Do you wish they hadn’t used any of them?  Did you want more of them in the end, like I did?  !&lt; [Spoiler] Kenobi’s approach to score was delayed gratification…but did it work?"
starwars,"I, like everyone else, loved the split mask scene with Vader in the Kenobi finale. However, canonically, Vader's vocal cords are meant to be nearly useless, and as such his real voice is supposed to be a whisper. Hearing James Earl Jones's voice mixed with Hayden's was a treat, but it does raise some questions about the extent of Vader's injuries. A gripe I have with THAT scene in Kenobi"
starwars,"It’s been two days since the episode aired and I think I’ve watched THAT FIGHT atleast 5 times. Truly an amazing fight, I’d even say one of the best in Star Wars history. The music, the strikes/attacks, the counters, the emotion, the details, just the entire choreography was phenomenal. A true W to us fans. Just wow…."
starwars,"One thing that was always clear in the original movie is that Obi-Wan never intended to win the fight against Vader. He wanted to become one with the force like Qui-Gon taught him to both inspire Luke to become a Jedi and to become more powerful than Vader could possibly imagine. In both Episode 3 and The Kenobi Show, we see Kenobi beat Vader multiple times, only losing 1 fight due to his fear and regret.

 The question is, could Kenobi have beaten Vader again on the Death Star if that was his goal? Obi-Wan wouldn't have stood a chance against Palpatine so it wouldn't have been a good plan and as we see, Kenobi did succeed in making Luke a great Jedi. In a proper fight to the death, would Kenobi still have enough edge to win against Vader or would Vader have gotten over his emotional imbalance and beaten Kenobi? Could Obi-Wan have beaten Vader in A New Hope?"
starwars,Has there ever been a dark side user that could use this ability? The idea that the sith were obsessed with immortality but went about it by cloning and midichlorian manipulation is interesting considering we know about force ghosts. Was Palpatine's whole quest at immortality because he knew he could never achieve this? is there anything in canon or legends that acknowledges sith force ghosts?
starwars,I think its a pretty perfect ending how Obi Wan kind of becomes this grey jedi just like his master (?) and learns to accept that feelings power the force but that you still cant let them take over. Kenobi Ep6
starwars,"Hear me out; I know we got the perfect Vader fix in Kenobi. I just feel like seeing Vader create his boogeyman persona in the 10 years leading up to Kenobi in a ""Vader"" series would be incredible.

Hayden is perfect for it and it wouldn't need to show Vader all that much so much as the aftermath of his presence while hunting Obi-Wan and other Jedis.

Almost like The Punisher meets Darth Vader. Fueling his rage after the death of Padme and betrayal by his best friend, he becomes the epitome of fear to all that oppose him as no one truly gets to live after seeing him.

It could even really just focus on him building up his Inquisitors force and their assaults on various Jedi in hiding. When things get out of hand for the inquisitors, Vader ""dark hallways"" their ass.

I know this seems like the ramblings of a lunatic but I feel like there is a good opportunity to show his story as truly killing Anakin over time, giving into all of his fear, anger, and hate, and taking it out on (at first) unsuspecting individuals. 

I dunno.  I think it could be really well done, while not over using Vader and diminishing his looming, boogeyman reputation.

Thank you for reading. You're awesome and may the force be with you...always. After watching Obi-Wan Kenobi, I need more Vader."
starwars,"When I was younger, I remember being intrigued by the Unleashed figures, and when the Force Unleashed games were announced, I was confused and had initially thought they were making a game based on the toys. I mean, the figures DO show force users doing things they would never do in the films. Did the Star Wars: Unleashed toyline inspire the Force Unleashed video games?"
starwars,Now that we have Kenobi series and Ashoka's one is on its way. I think it would be awesome to have a series about Vader after Order 66. Vader series?
starwars,Star trek is the best anime i love when zorg beats up the klorgorians and then lionardi di caprio pulls up in his lamnbo and has sex with a 22 year old Liam neeson is in kenobi
starwars,"I wanted to pop in and ask y’all, ok for me to say that Rogue One is my favorite Star Wars movie? Or will I be burned at the stake for this opinion?😂 Rogue One is my favorite movie"
starwars,"I was watching the prequel trilogy and it got me thinking.... Who pays for the Jedi Order? 

Do they have a revenue source?
Or is it considered a public service and therefore taxpayers in the Republic contribute to them?

Do Jedi's have salaries? 

I'm just curious if any star warsedia talks about this 

Thanks What was the Jedi Order's business model?"
starwars,"Like it's so bad, he just turned then started killing without objection then tried to kill his wife, he then became darth vader and his wife died for no reason at all. I just watched episodes 1-3 and all of the clone wars and anakin Skywalker has the worst backstory I have ever seen!"
starwars,"Everyone knows about the sith rule of two. There is always a master and an apprentice no more no less. In legends we got the amazing Bane Trilogy that explains that it was Darth Bane who created the rule of two to end sith infighting, this explanation was later canonized in The Clone Wars.

However going back and looking at George Lucas's statements on the Rule of Two it seems like he intended it to be a more organic thing that formed out of necessity rather than some sith lord intentionally founding it. 

""Every time you get two sith together you have the master, you have the apprentice and the apprentice is always trying to recruit another apprentice to join with him to kill the master"" 

Also note how george's explanation shows that the apprentice needs an apprentice of their own to help overthrow their master rather than growing strong enough to do it themselves like is generally shown in legends.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that from a certain point of view these explanations can co-exist but I think it's pretty clear that george had a different idea of how the rule of two came about. Rule of Two, a tale of two origins"
starwars,"Ok, let me explain. Reva went from an underling to the 3rd most powerful sith and most powerful woman in the galaxy to a person with a heart and an icon of how much people can change in a month. 

Now compare that to Rey who spent her life living in an AT-AT on Jakku and randomly found out she was a Jedi. She then spent the next 2 YEARS doing meaningless and menial stuff just to find out she was the flesh and blood of the galaxy's greatest oppressor, and then she denounces it and begins to call herself a Skywalker.

So, my point is, Reva is magnitudes of order better than Rey and had more character development than she did in 4% of the time. Reva was one of the best characters in Kenobi."

starwars,"As a child of the 90s I think it may be somewhat Taboo to say what I'm going to say but..

Obi wan Kenobi, the mandalorian and the book of boba fett have been the best written star wars stories told in the star wars universe. I accept the fact that they would be nothing without the originals and the prequels but they have very few negatives compared to those six films. Both George Lucas and Disney have made their fair share of mistakes, it's just that Disneys shit decisions have been condensed into episodes 8 and 9.

Obi wan Kenobi was a masterpiece in star wars canon. Controversial opinion incoming.."

starwars,"In any battle between two force users, there’s typically a couple times when each might use the force to (for example) throw something at their opponent. Or maybe push their opponent away…

However, I have always wondered…why wouldn’t a force user simply lift/levitate their opponent, say, 50 feet in the air and then slam them into the ground? New here: Question about “the force”"
starwars,"So basically all the already existing, and confirmed WIP projects (aka Andor, Ahsoka, games, etc) and some details about them can be found? Is there any place / site where all confirmed Star Wars projects are listed?"
starwars,"I have never watched any star wars films or series and looking to get into it.
What is the release date order for all content I should watch because I see theres prequels and I want to watch everything in the order they were released in and not chronological. Looking to start Star Wars."
starwars,"The poster I’m mentioning is with Vader on a planet with the shadow of Kenobi above him. I think this poster is fascinating with how it breaks the traditional poster format. Most posters for a show/movie like this would have the hero be small with the threat/antagonist be a larger focus of the poster(examples: Thanos in Infinity War, the Deathstar in Rogue One poster, etc.), but in the Kenobi poster, Kenobi is larger than Vader. To me this is because Vader isn’t the centered antagonist, but Obi-Wan is to himself. Obi-Wan’s doubts and regret to himself is the obstacle that he has to overcome. It’s pet of the heroes journey and I love how this poster describes that in a beautiful way.

Link to poster: https://m.imdb.com/title/tt8466564/mediaviewer/rm1541542401/?ref_=tt_ov_i I really love the Kenobi poster"
starwars,"I don't count TPM. I watch following the machete order (4,5,2,3,6) I was never I hater of the prequels but I believe they have aged well. thoughts? The Prequels have aged well"
starwars,"I was wondering if a ""light sided"" jedi who got like really pissed off suddenly could immediatly turn to dark side and release a hell lightning storm or tap into the dark powers at the same strength as they would their light side powers

&amp;#x200B;

like im watching yoda fight palpatine out of curiousity

palpatine body decays worse and worse as he tries to kill yoda with lightning.. but Yoda looks way more fit and healthy to me 

I mean unless hes just underestimating him,  couldnt he tap into his revenge/anger and kill him with a quick jolt to his already decaying body..

&amp;#x200B;

If that makes any sense. Ive never heard of it in any lore but remember in KOTOR that you would have to be completely dark side to unlock the full potential of your powers and at that point you couldnt revert back Random question from someone who hasnt watched or followed anything since KOTOR2 and before they sold out to disney"
starwars,"I don't know if this is far too deep down the line but Darth Darth Plagueis and Palpatine (Sideous) we're the ones that were interested in him. But it took Count Dooku to tell Palpatine about him. I got the feeling Palpatine and Darth Plagueis made the child and don't want anyone to know about him.  
And of course, Qui-Gon found him and must have liaised a lot with Dooku to tell him about it..

So there are two other ways it could have gone, Sideous goes on to conquer everything using him like he did Maul.  
Or Qui-Gon and Dooku could have used him to make some kind of separatism thing as Dooku left the force and Quin-Jon and him were as close as father and son could get. Dooku says Qui-Gon is basically a son to him and was devastated when he died, and Kenobi was like a grandson. I wonder if it could be redone somehow one day with fans deciding the timeline. Because it seems rather desolate basically as we see Vadar just an angry half-robot and wandering around wanting revenge.

Also, how couldn't Anikan sense Luke? It's his son, Qui-Gon Sensed Anikan! (leads on the theory Qui-Gon was actually Darth Plagueis and Anakans Father as he produced him) getting hunted by Jeeva? That could be good for a season 2 basically we see this happen and Anikan saves Luke and picks up on it and tries to chase down Kenobi and Luke? We'll see. Plagueis, Qui-Gon"
starwars,"Ever since I was young I watched Clone Wars and every movie. It helped me Realize something that it taught us when we didn't know it.As Obi-wan said to Maul in the Clone Wars those who embrace fear become weak and loose all touch with people around them.While those who embrace there fear and conquer it end up becoming stronger through that fear.

What does Star wars mean too you? Star Wars through my eyes."
starwars,I am absolutely convinced that my boy Obi-Wan could have easily whooped his ass a third time. It really drives home that his sacrifice was 100% intentional and that he became more powerful than we can possibly imagine. [Spoilers] This series actually kind of enhances the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader in A New Hope for me
starwars,"He actually teaches him the truth of corruption present in society.

He provides an outlet for Anakin to vent out, but also calls him out on his impulsive emotions. 

Understands that sometimes it's right to use anger to fight for what you want.

Recognizes Anakin as a genuinely troubled youth who needs help rather than simple disciplinary force exercises. 

Offers to help Anakin save Padme, rather than face the legitimate possibility of expelling him. I can't be the only one who thinks that Palpatine was a genuinely good father figure to Anakin right?"
starwars,"
Are we really gunna try to defend a show that hired people who never even worked on sw write it cause once I figured out that I kinda knew this show was gunna be more of a cash grab than caring about sw idk y people trust Disney so much with these shows especially on Reddit mainly there’s so many reasons on why Disney shouldn’t be making sw shows like this anymore or at least for a while if ur d riding the show ur just a media consumer at that point you can like what you like and it’s not all that bad it just doesn’t make sense on why people would appreciate these shows that much when it’s more about making money and pleasing the people than making actually deep sw content like the shows look sick and all just it ain’t the same and it’s low key hard to accept that Sure there’s deep scenes here and there but other than that feels like I’m watching a marvel wanna be sw most of the time and one more thing Disney is already most likely making a season 2 of kenobi after they seen how much views it got and that right there is a prime ex of how little they care about the story and just want to expand the shit as much as they can to just milk everything they put out , And it’s funny how kenobi was supposed to be a 1 season show 😂 they literally go omg look how many people watched the kenobi show oh well guess we gotta make up shit to expand the story😂cause you know what that means🤑 It’s not all bad the kenobi show just most of it is"
starwars,"  

(Spoilers) This is for the record. Mandalorian s1 was great fun but had some noteworthy writing mistakes. Mandalorian s2 had much more substantial mistakes but was still overall enjoyable. Boba Fett had such significant problems not only in the writing but also the directing that it became cringeworthy and unenjoyable, and Kenobi has gotten inexcusably bad, but everyone has BLINDED themselves to objective terrible writing and directing because “its star wars.” When you refuse to critique writing and directing teams and shovel money down their throats no matter what even as the quality continues to degrade, they will stop caring and give you anything with no effort and that is what has happened here. This will probably fall on deaf ears, but someone has to be the first just go through and point out the ALL the failures. So here it is everything the writers and directors did wrong with Kenobi, and even if you still liked the show, think back on it after you read these and really ask yourselves if your opinion hasn’t nudged at all. There are good, even great things in this show, but they are buried beneath a mountain of effortless garbage.

PART: 1 (the least offender, by far)

· The notion that the inquisition and Third Sister just happens to encounter the 1 guy on the entire planet in Owen, who happens to be fathering a force sensitive by sheer chance- and which will become incredibly important knowledge by part 6 is a pretty massive suspension of disbelief. Third sister is also established as so evil and goal driven that she will cut off civilians’ hands for the slightest of back talk, which really does not wash with her character later being to revealed to have been forced into service to survive and seek revenge for her murdered jedi friends. 

· The Leia chase scene: Talked about to death, I know, but baffling that the directors did this. The notion that a 10 year old girl can outrun full grown adults as portrayed here assisted by cutaways is absurd to watch. It is so impossible that one of the henchmen actors can be seen running at an angled stride just so he can’t overtake her. This was not one of the more consequential failures but a red flag that shows the directors are so blind to failures of quality. It should be noted- and this is a trend- there may be some ways a director could make this work-but they did not here, and it looks terrible.

· The inquisitors catch and hang the Rogue Jedi but later we find out that they entomb their murdered Jedi victims in Amber at the Fortress Inquisitorius. Why they did not do that with this guy is unknown and the audience is left with nothing but conjecture. Also, the stringing him up by the arms to make it kid friendly is awkwardly handled and looks weird.

Part 2 (things fall apart)

· Kenobi walking around in a Jedi Robe seems incredibly inconspicuous and a poor decision for an actual jedi trying to stay under the radar. 

· Kenobi makes clear that he is looking for “his daughter” “somewhere on the planet” and that he cannot track the ship. He then finds her because he finds a bottom feeder who directs him to the “sewers” where apparently very nasty people are. This terribly done writing. The staff simply did not bother to devote any time to establishing a believable or compelling chain of events for how Kenobi is able to locate Leia, so they just did this and he miraculously finds her across an entire planet. This screams of the show needing another episode but not getting it.

· This episode clearly establishes Leia as a prodigy. She makes an insane leap in logic based on very limited information to determine that the man sent to rescue her is the reason she was kidnapped- to get to him, all just by seeing his wanted poster. However, at the same time, she is asking him to make her float in public and showing almost no regard for the fact that she was just kidnapped. These don’t mix, it makes her look bipolar and her “serious side” is beginning to become a but cringey. Making a 10 year old a serious natured character in live action is really hard, I will openly admit, and the writing and directing staff is just not up to the task.

· Reva kidnaps Leia on a hunch to draw out Kenobi which proves to work. This based on a connection found between Organa and Kenobi in the archives, apparently betting Organa will turn to him. This implies, frankly would require, communication between Organa and Kenobi, which the empire now knows. This screws with continuity. How can Organa not be arrested for conspiring with a jedi? 

· The Reva is “from the Gutter” stuff is weird because we later learn she came from the temple. Vader is shown to have known this from the beginning in part 5 and surely her identity is known. As seen later the inquisitors not only have access to Jedi archives but immortalize their kills in amber including those killed in order 66 (see the youngling), so they could easily deduce that she was missing. Then why is she treated as “the least of them” cus shes from the gutter? The grand inquisitor has her same origin, he was a temple guard, as shown in rebels. Kenobi says that a lot of the inquisitors are ex-jedi in this very series.  Are they basing this off the location they found her at? This is so strange in retrospect.

· Leia chase scene part 2: absurd, nonsensical forced solely to move the plot forward, abysmally directed. There is a section where kenobi’s friggin fingernails are touching her but he just choses not to pick her up cus the chase needed to continue- I was baffled that they left this in the cut.

· The grand inquisitor stopping Reva from catching Kenobi when he is 5 feet away is hilariously contrived. “This is how its done” as he is about to do same thing she was about to. 

· The stabbing itself, has gotten a lot of heat. The motivation is fine for Reva, the arbitrary decision of whether a lightsaber impaling you is instantly fatal, like with Qui-Gon and many Clone Wars Jedi, but survivable when the plot needs it to happen is contrived. I believe its possible, imperial troops could have saved the Grand Inquisitor, but then why wasn’t Reva outed, were they just punking her the whole time…surely they could have taken the same actions she did to pursue Kenobi from here, they didn’t need her.

· Finally, Reva’s rageful screaming at Kenobi about how Vader will get him is out of character because Reva is revealed to hate Vader.

Part 3: (The Elements Bend)

· When they arrive at the checkpoint Kenobi is found out, he takes out the probe droid and 4 or 5 stormtroopers with just his blaster. During the fight Kenobi uses the guy that drove him there as a human shield, why? Because he supports the Empire and asked the troopers to check out some dudes he thought were suspicious. This is one is more opinionated but this came off as really out of character for Kenobi to me, this guy is objectively pretty innocent being pro regime alone does not warrant being used as a meat shield.

· Kenobi then shoots the laser fence instead of simply walking around it. This is fine. It does not matter. He’s in a rush… I don’t know why everyone jumps on this…. what isn’t fine is what happens next. A small transport finds Kenobi and Leia, 3 stormtroopers get out after Kenobi just killed 5 combatants and Kenobi surrenders. Kenobi has also been made at this point there is no reason for him not to break out the lightsaber, so its even more weird that he doesn’t fight them. Upon surrendering he gets on the ground THE GUN REMAINS IN HIS HAND THE ENTIRE TIME IN PLAIN VIEW and its somehow never addressed… All of this is horrible to behold on screen.

·  Vader’s first encounter with Kenobi really feels like it lacks the gravity it should, Kenobi does everything he can to run, dialogue is limited to a few brief generic lines and the lightsaber choreography is very poor. They try to make it look easy for Vader by doing everything one-handed, including blocks and saber bashes but it just doesn’t look good. 

· I’m fine with the premise that Kenobi is weak and his force ability atrophied from lack of use, but at the same time, he has to train Luke, why would he allow his abilities to degrade? In this very series he approaches Owen about training Luke even as a boy, so its an odd choice.

· Kenobi’s force wall is broken and he is dragged through fire face first. He is not horrifically scarred and emerges with only burns on his arm. His clothes do not catch on fire and he does not ignite. Fire as an entity has been bent to the writers-director’s will. 

· Vader extinguishes the flames with the force, bizarrely has a trooper fetch Kenobi instead of him picking him up again, and Talia intervenes igniting the blaze more so than before. Not only does Vader not use the force to extinguish the flames again, but he does not stop the loader droid from escaping with Kenobi, he stares blankly on. The fire can be justified by it being a bigger blaze this time if you stretch it. Not stopping the droid is a plot hole. In part 5 Vader halts an entire escaping ship that must the size of a light corvette and rips it to pieces from a distance. But he can’t use the force on the droid meters away? What is he Sandor Clegane, does fire give him Mustafar flashbacks, when there is just a little bit too much of it? Inexcusable. Vader is rendered an idiot.

· At the end of the episode Leia who has been running through the same tunnel that Reva entered way after her runs into Reva ahead of her who has already killed Leia’s pilot. The laws of physical space have bent to the writer-director’s will. Reva entered from the same village and the exact same doorway as Leia, there are multiple shots blatantly establishing its same door behind the same rack, we have no reason to believe that Leia took some kind of longer path or if there is even more than one path- and if there was, why didn’t Talia send her on that path? Reva is just ahead of her and also didn’t run into Talia on her way back. There is no explanation for any of this. The audience is left completely confused, its criminally bad writing.

starwars,My daughters boyfriend has Berber seen any Star Wats movies. (He’s great besides that point) What order do you suggest he watch them? Should he include Clone Wars and the Disney series? What order is best for new watchers
starwars,"I see a lot of people saying that the show was awful, that the writing was terrible, that some episodes were laughably bad, etc. But I’ve not seen anyone actually explaining why “it’s this bad”. All I see is people saying that it looks cheap and the writing is bad. What metric are you using to measure the quality of the writing? Sure, the bad guys chasing Leia scene was ridiculous but I feel like people make such a big deal out of things that are just not that relevant. I’d just like to see someone who can actually justify with well-thought arguments why this show “was so laughably terrible”. For everyone who is hating on the Kenobi show, why?"

Decided to buy myself a little present. I've been waiting for this guy for like a week. Welcome home, Lord Vader!

starwars,"

Greetings, exhalted ones. I come to you simply to talk to you all, about star wars itself. Not from one side, one perspective, one viewpoint. Just. Talk. 

We are all divided. That is clear to say, it is within human nature to have opinions and we are geared to stick close to those who agree and oppose those who do not, however this division is bringing great disaster to our community. Let me first discuss the elephant in the room. Trilogies. All three trilogies have their fans, and their haters, however we all forget that it is still STAR WARS. No matter the era, it is still the same title which should bring us together. It does not matter whether you grew up with the beginning, discovering the same of skywalker, hearing of the empire and watching luke's journey to defeat the empire and save his father. It does not matter whether you grew up seeing the height of the republic, fall to ashes at the hands of a broken man, promised so much more. It does not matter whether you grew up viewing a journey of self discovery of a girl who is a tie to a long past turmoil.

It does not matter what trilogy you grew up with. Or which you like the best. We should all be united under feelings. The feeling of amazement seeing the first ignition of a lightsaber. The fear of the main villains being utterly badass and complex characters in themselves. The feeling that you yourself is growing along side these characters, learning lessons about yourself whilst you view (I know I have). I am not a blind viewer, being a devoted member of the star wars fandom I am aware of the hate and downsides of every piece of star wars. Yes it is true that the sequels may have written their main character not as the fans would've liked, or written the character of luke against his morals, or 'invalidated vaders sacrifice'. But the OT and PT made mistakes too. The prequels were also criticised because of their bad writing, and continuity buffers they created with the introduction of the clone wars series. The originals whilst limited by their time were critized because of these continuity buffers that not everything lines up, but they cannot help that. They can't change an already decades old treasured movie. 

Star wars is complicated. Not everyone will agree on any given thing. But do not hate others for simply being of a different time period. Those born to witness the originals in theatres would see the  Birth of star wars. And they are so lucky to have seen that. The reveal of lukes father is a twist like none other in cinema. But that does not mean any star wars content after that 'isn't star wars'. Star wars has evolved into more than just the skywalker saga. And those who prefer the originals. Please, just view the franchise for all it has become. Both the highs and the lows. Look at the tributes to the originals in every piece of works. Look at how from your single trilogy, so much has sparked from it. Its truly magical and you should be sharing those feelings with those around you.

Those of you like myself who were of an Age to come into the franchise with the prequels, and later discover the original trilogy. We had more to view up front than our predecessors. We got the view the republic. Anakins rise and fall, the becoming of vader and the rise of sidious. We saw star wars, through the perspective those before us couldn't for the first time. But because of the technology difference, or the storyline, we should not compare ourselves. We had so much more to base the trilogy off of because star wars 4-6 was already written. There was an already established universe to explore the history of. And my god did they make that history packed with some of the greatest content in its history. But we are no better than the originals. Or the dark horse people turn away from.

Which brings me to the sequels. Disney's crack at star wars. Yes it was more 'kid friendly', there was alot of fan service to draw people in and many plots and characters either felt empty, or incorrect. But we should not hold that against them. They had to balance introducing the new generation to the amazing franchise we've been apart of, whilst also catering to us at the same time. It was certainly possible and I'm not giving them a scapegoat. But what they created still opened the doors for the new generation to explore star wars at their own pace. The OT, PT and clone wars, rebels, etc had all been put in place; they had an encyclopedia of content to view. For them, the sequels was a story of good vs evil, but told from the perspective of a young blood, introduced to characters that we as veterans know the stories of, but the new audience didn't. The 'fan service' to us, only heightened the interest of the new audience to delve deeper into star wars. 

And thats what I find beautiful about star wars. No matter its highs or lows. Its all connected. In a way, no one's ever really gone.there is no piece of content which will make us feel like this isn't what we know as star wars.every franchise may have movies that some do not like. But what are we doing hating eachother over it? For crying out loud people we are all the same side of a coin. It should be us standing together in unison embracing the love for our community. Not tearing it down to the ashes to defend which character beats who or which film is the best. From my point of view. We can be so much more.

Star wars will not be perfect. We all want the story to play how we see it. There is so much to explore as a 'what if' hypothetical that no one will truly be satisfied. But we do not need to fight eachother over it. You can sit here and read my post and down vote, or ignore it, or comment that I am completely out of my mind. And you are within your right to do so. But for those who take the time to read this. Please, give others the patience and freedom to enjoy what they want, even if you may not. You both belong to a community of some of the best people I have ever met. And certainly best franchises. You may not see a difference because at the end of the day we are only singular people. The hate and the divide will speak louder thsn our actions no matter what we do. But I haven't and will not stop attempting to unite the people of this franchise, even if it is to no avail, so long as I can change one person's opinion, my journey will have been a success. 

Why should you listen to me instead of yourself? You shouldn't. The choice is yours.

However why should you think about what I said? Well, to quote someone we all know. 'Because I asked' let's get real for a moment"
starwars,Go Favorite Movies of all time
starwars,"Does anyone have like an estimate of what he can do with the force? Obi-Wan felt very inconsistent to me, especially when Obi-Wan threw the rocks at Vader in episode 6. It was a little weird how in the previous episode he could stop an entire ship with one hand but couldn't stop a couple of rocks being thrown at him. Maybe it was just plot armor but do the comics or TV shows ever explain how powerful he is? How strong is Vader?"
starwars,"ok, dont get me wrong it was an amazing fight to watch, but personally i think it shouldve been more of an emotional/mental fight, with stratergy and maybe falling back to some of obi wans teachings that anakin didnt learn well,

but instead we just got obi wan beating prime vader, like prime vader was supposed to be like top 3 force users (in cannon (excluding the ones cuz their feats weird). anyway, it was pretty much, pal mvp, then prime vader/luke depending on who u ask, (then some people put ray up there but thats just wrong), anyway, having obi wan beat vader while vader is in his prime  and obi wan is like 15 years older than him and hasnt really trained or even used the force or a lightsaber in like 10 years, and like 2 days prior to him stomping vader he struggled to just slow down leia falling, and now he has had one of the best force feats weve seen,

idk, personally i wouldve rather had a more story orientated fight than obi wan just being strong sort of out of nowhere, I Dont liek that obi wan beat vader"

starwars,"If Vader wanted Kenobi so badly. He could have sent the star destroyer after the rebel ship and followed Kenobi in his own fighter.

Or he could've sent a few squadrons of the 72 TIE fighters in the star destroyer's hangar bay to take both of them out...

Makes no sense. Kenobi Episode 6. I thought Vader was supposed to be smart."
starwars,"Why didn’t obi wan kill darth Vader then and there in the final episode. Obviously he can’t or else the events of episodes 4,5 and 6 can’t take place. Is it due to him pitying Vader or what? I don’t if this is silly question?"
starwars,"Kenobi was everything I’ve been asking the past 17 years for with wanting to see the repercussions of where Anakin and Obi-Wan left off on Mustafar. I loved it but holy shit did it leave me with blue balls for more clone wars era content.

I know this is an unlikely scenario but imagine Disney giving Dave Filoni full creative control over a live action Clone Wars show that features a de-aged Hayden and Ewan? Obviously it’d tell new stories rather than retread the same ones. I’d love to have a chance to see more live-action Grievous as well, he’s such a dope villain but gets such little screen time in live action.

The scene of Obi-Wan and Anakin dueling and training in episode 5 is what sealed it for me though. I forgot how much I fucking missed seeing these two interact and I want *more*. I’m greedy, I want so much more of this. With proper writing it’s obvious these two can go so much higher than what they were given in the prequels. Please Disney. *Give me more.* It’s official, I cannot rest until we get a live action Clone Wars era show"
starwars,"…leaving Vader alive? I loved that whole fight, but I’m obsessing over various details, for instance—

“…Either he will die or I will, Master…” I feel like that was him accepting that killing Vader is the only way, which echos later on when he tells Luke there is no winning this if Vader doesn’t die.

But here’s the main thing I wanted to see what all of you thought/think.

Did Obi leave him alive because “…a Jedi’s role is to defend life, not take it…” and he was saving Anakin’s life? Knowing that his hope in Anakin’s children comes from the Force and he must trust they will redeem him? 

But then why did he say, “then my friend is truly, dead”… was that just some fan-service to rhyme with “then my father is truly dead…” 

Did he see the blue of Anakin’s eye and think, “there he is…” and then when Vader came back to say the whole “…I’m not your failure Obi-Wan…” did he (Obi) fully realize how pathetic Vader actually is, intuitively knowing his end was inevitable, and the only way to redeem Anakin is to allow his children to “kill” Vader. That line of thinking kinda falls in line with Obi’s “…from a certain point of view…” outlook.

I guess I’m just struggling with that theory because of the dialogue throughout the episode.

What do you guys think? Hope you guys stay safe today. What do you guys think of Obi…"

starwars,"Just a consideration that came to me and interested to hear this community's thoughts.

In the series finale, Obi-Wan destroys the left side of Vader's helmet, revealing the left portion of what used to be Anakin. In Rebels, it is reversed, with Ahsoka damaging the right side of the helmet and revealing the remnants of Anakin on that side. Neither character was successful in a literal sense of reaching Anakin based on their past relationship and bringing him back into the light. Both duals end in the ""Vader"" persona remaining firmly in control, despite Anakin's past ties to both characters who damage the helmet to reveal the literal and figurative split in identity. 

However, it takes Luke, Vader's own blood and one of Anakin's last connections to Padme aside from Leia, to fully remove the helmet both literally and figuratively, restoring Anakin's identity through redemption and finally eliminating the Vader persona entirely. Whether intentional or not, it plays well into Anakin/Vader's duality and the theme of familial redemption.

starwars,"I don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but I think that if judging each trilogy solely off of its lightsaber battles, the sequels would win for the best duels. The OT duels work because they are built on strong emotion and feel climactic and exciting, but the choreography just hasn’t aged too well. The prequels, while usually stunning looking, are perhaps a little TOO over-choreographed, and a lot of the duels don’t have the powerful emotion behind them that the OT did (excluding Anakin v. Obi-Wan, of course). But the ST has the best of both worlds: beautiful visuals, emotional tension, high stakes, and the perfect balance between simplistic and overdone choreo. Technology advancing also definitely is a bonus here, but just the SOUNDS of the lightsabers are so pure and almost magical feeling. I understand a lot of the criticisms of the sequels, but I will never understand the hatred of the lightsaber battles. To me, they’re probably the most brilliant parts of the movies. I’ll say it— the sequel trilogy has the best lightsaber duels."

starwars,"I keep seeing articles and opinions about the Obi-Wan Kenobi series having a huge plot hole in that Kenobi didn't know Anakin was Vader until Reva told him although he heard him called that in Episode III. 

My argument is that yes he knew that Anakin became Vader, but most of the galaxy didn't know that Vader existed. He was even just a rumor amongst the imperials. Vader was Palpatine's secretish enforcer. Obi-Wan lived in isolation. He cut himself off from the outside world. He knew little to nothing of the outside goings on beyond Tatooine. 

What he was surprised about wasn't that he was Vader. It was that he was still alive. He left him for dead and had no knowledge of his survival and transformation. This is why hearing he was alive was shocking not to mention when he finally encountered him again. Obi-Wan not knowing about Anakin being Vader is not a plot hole."

What films or TV shows do you include or exclude, and in what order would you watch them? I'm mostly interested in live-action only, but would be open to hearing some suggestions including animated shows like TCW &amp; Rebels. Reasoning would be appreciated :)

I only ask this because I'm gonna start the series with my GF, who literally knows nothing about it (including the Vader thing!), and I'm tentatively planning on going chronological with 1-2-3-Kenobi-4-5-6.

starwars,"Yo! A mexican guy here! 

So, i want to buy a lightsaber for training/combat purposes, i have see pages like ultrasaber or arms at fire(i really liked the design of the temple guard) but for ultrasaber i have readed really bad commentaries and for arms at fire i heard that they cost more than $900 and thats is really expensive to me, really really expensive, so, after a full day of search i have come here to ask wich place is the best or what are you preferences.

I don't have any problem with the price, except if it is more than $600(talking on USD) thats something i just can't afford for a lightsaber.

I don't have any problem too if it doesnt have good sound at all, i just want one that is durable and designed for fights(lose 500 dollars in less than 2 or 5 months is really gonna be hard for me, haha)

I would really like it to be customized but like the others, i don't have problem if is an already designed one(im in love with the Jedi temple ones but i have see that the Hasbro one is not really good)

Thx for reading and answer, i apologize for my bad english! Where i should buy a lightsaber?"
starwars,So I was thinking about Reva surviving her second stab. Maybe the first time she was stabbed she had cybernetic implants put in like Fennec Shard? And when Vader stabbed her the second time it went through those implants mostly and only hurt her a little A possible way [REDACTED] could have survived in Kenobi…
starwars,"When I saw some episode of TCW as a kid I remember really liking him because of his design but now that Im fully rewatching it Im realizing just how cool he is. Like he beat the shit out of Anakin and Obi Wan at the same time and then went on to fight Ventress and Dooku at the same time too. Sure he lost very quickly, but it was still an awesome fight. Every time he’s onscreen he does something cool. There is not a single scene with him that isn’t great. He’s seriously one of my favorite characters one. I wonder why people hardly talk about him because for me he is the highlight of the Clone Wars, which is saying something because almost the entire show is good


I need a disney plus show about him or something. We need more scenes of him kicking ass. Though Im assuming he dies sometime inbetween the Deathwatch stuff and the finale of TCW so maybe thats not possible Savage Opress is so cool"
starwars,"Revealing my age a little, but when  TPM released, I was right around the same age my dad was when ANH came out. As such, me and my brothers grew up with a Star Wars trilogy just like my dad and had all the toys. My dad took a trip to his parents house and brought back all the ones he and my uncle had, and together those toys made a big part of my childhood.  Anybody else have a similar experience? How many of you got Star Wars toys that your mom/dad had as a kid to play with alongside your own?"
starwars,"Okay hear me out.
With Hayden Christensen back in the fold and Ewan McGregor.

I know this sounds crazy, but c'mon we all dreamed of it.

We need a timeline in the future where an unbeatable Sith Lord emerges, or an enemy that simply cannot be beaten by the Jedi of that time whether that be Rey or in the future. A super strong villain that is 5x stringer than Palpatine and Vader.

Therefore the council heads a research mission where they discover how to travel fast enough to go back in time but somehow there's a plot where they can only do it twice.

So what they do is they go back in time to pick up a Jedi or two that can potentially help them defeat the powerful Sith Lord.
And I'm talking super strong .

So they pick up Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi from their timeline, tell them about the situation, train them for 3-4 years so they reach their maximum potential , and we get a trilogy of Anakin Skywalker at his max potential .

After defeating this enemy they are returned to their timelines and the time traveling recipe or spacecraft is lost forever.

End of story. Anakin Series or Movie"
starwars,"Did George Lucas have a son?
It seems relevant to his franchise now. who, and what is first in life should come last."
starwars,"I’ve not been a fan of the show, I have like bits very tiny bits, but for the most part I think the show was just an idea, executed extremely bad… extremely bad.

I don’t blame any of the cast, I think they did an amazing job with the lazy script they were given, I liked the actors, and Ewan McGregor slays his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi just like he did in the prequels.

I just don’t get why Obi-Wan didn’t finish Vader right there and then. He let him alive so he could break havoc across the galaxy.

And why… So that Luke or Leia could kill their father because that was their destiny!!!

Think about it, that is so messed up from the part of the writers, so messed up specially since he had already won.

The first time Obi-Wan defeated Vader I get why he left him alive, he had already won, Anakin was dying, he didn’t want to be the one to kill his brother so he left him to die there, but he didn’t. I really understand why Anakin lived and fully embrace Vader.

But the second time around. Obi-Wan had the upper hand, Vader was at his mercy, but he didn’t strike why? Because he was his friend, his brother. He said “goodbye Vader”… Vader! That’s an acknowledgement that all their ties are severed, so why did he live? So one of his children could kill him.

The fact that he didn’t killed Vader because it was the destiny of his children to do it goes AGAINST everything that Obi-Wan stands for and all that he is.

After 10 years and a second confrontation, if Vader had won, in a not so easy yet espectacular way and Obi-Wan had no choice but to run, and eventually train Luke and Leia because by that point he wasn’t a match for Vader anymore, that I get, that’s a premise I can get behind.

I’m sure a bunch of you liked the show, and truly glad that you did, it just wasn’t the show for me. Why did Obi-Wan let Darth Vader alive? So one of his children could finish him up? That’s is so wrong"
starwars,"i’ve been thinking about this for a while now. 

What if in the future i come across a youngling who haven’t seen starwars. Do i show the youngling the prequels first? or the OG trilogy?.

with the prequels the youngling can think “is Anakin really going to turn to the darkside?”

with the OG trilogy, the youngling can get jedi mind fucked by the twist that is Darth Vader being Luke’s father.

what are your suggestions. How do I introduce StarWars"
starwars,"Hear me out, before you throw tomatoes at me. I don't really post but I need somewhere to post my thoughts on this series. Long post ahead.

I just did a second viewing of the finale and on my first viewing, there was something that didn't sit right with me during their battle, and it's the part where Vader buries Obi-wan alive with a ton of rocks. I had the same question as everyone else, why the frick didn't Vader just stab him instead of this roundabout way of killing him?

Then it hit me: Obi-wan is literally, physically and metaphorically being crushed by his guilt and past.

During this scene, what replays in his head is the voices of Anakin and Vader overlaying with each other. In the past episodes, Obi-wan seems to have lost hope in anything and is wracked by guilt, regrets, and grief. It's why he turned away that Jedi in the first episode, why he didn't fight for the man with a family and why he rejected Bail in rescuing Leia. He has also lost faith in people (not trusting Haja) and just a generally downtrodden person. He even lost faith in the force and has not used it in ten years. It's like being an artist and not painting, or a violinist and not playing the violin. Heck, you can say it's like not using your arms because the Force has always been there as an extension of himself. He buried his lightsaber in the sand, which he always said is ""his life"", which means he himself has buried HIM in the sand. He doesn't like the name Obi-wan, he uses Ben (it's why it was so important for Leia to use the name Obi-wan during the finale, but correct me if I'm wrong here). For him, the ""war is over"" and the ""fight is done"". He tells Nari to bury his lightsaber in the sand which is to turn his back on everything they've fought for because that's exactly what he did. This is not Obi-wan Kenobi, the Jedi. This is Ben, who is no one. There is no hope in the future, and certainly no hope for himself, because ""he's not the man he used to be"". 

Anyone who has ever experienced mental health issues and depression, these words sound very familiar. 

Depression, PTSD, grief and trauma warps you to the point you lose yourself and your life. Considering what Obi-wan has been through, can we really blame him? Every part of the galaxy is just another living reminder of what he lost and why it's his fault and how he failed. When he wakes up, the ache is renewed. He's not just grieving Anakin, the Jedi, Padme, his life - he's also grieving himself, who he used to be. Because when he we see him at Episode 1, he's but a shell of a broken man.

Aside from depression and hopelessness, avoidance is another symptom of PTSD. He makes Luke as his excuse, but there is no reason for him to just sit in the sand for 10 years, let himself rot away except to atone for his supposed sins. He disavowed his name, his lightsaber, his clothes, and his Jedi principles, the fricking Force. He's been avoiding everything and anything because it just hurts him, until the past literally hits him in the face. When Obi-wan faces Darth Vader for the first time (special shoutout to him having an almost heart attack for simply feeling the presence of someone you thought dead for ten years), it's laughable how he just runs. He just keeps running from Vader, until the ghost of his past literally catches up to him. 

The reason why he loses this fight is because he has nothing to fight for; not even Leia, not even Tala, not even the Path. Because people cannot save you, you yourself have to *choose* to save yourself.

I agree some parts feel lackluster, but people just don't get it. 

This show is not about us, it's about Obi-wan and his emotional journey. It's about healing and how one can move on from such unimaginable loss. 

In a way, its also about how one can fight trauma, PTSD, depression and grief. 

On his own, Obi-wan failed. He thought by locking himself away in some tower he can heal, or he doesn't deserve to have a life after everything he did. It's only through his emotional growth with Leia, Tala, Roken, the Path people and even Reva did he finally heal from the loss of Anakin, the Jedi, and his perceived failures.  Leia showed him love and hope. Tala showed him that even if we did terrible things in the past, we can still and *must* do something to make that right. The Path showed him that the Jedi spiritually and the fight is alive and well, and all of these people showed him that he is not alone nor powerless or helpless, unlike what his mind has been telling him (The disconnect between the mind and reality is important in mental health).

Heck, say all you want about Reva, but she is the perfect foil for Obi-wan. Reva carried herself from the gutter to killing Vader, because she thought revenge and vengeance will what make everything better, will what make her heal from her traumatic past. But when she finally had Luke in her hands, it didn't. She realized she will not heal by killing Luke. She is only killing herself. She can only heal by honoring them, and living for herself. That's the only way to move on.

So let's go back to this scene:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*crushed by rocks obito style\*](https://preview.redd.it/eal9qruckl791.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4edd164fb199a09a61b507d37f4b5ae9de762f1c)

This time, he is not just in a metaphorical hole, he IS in a hole. Everyone who's ever been depressed or been through something traumatic, a common metaphor would be like you're trapped in a hole you cannot ever climb out of, endlessly falling and crushed. So what does Obi-wan do in this scenario?

Instead of Anakin, he hears Luke and Leia. This moment is important, because he *chooses* to save himself and fight for the future. If we put Episode 1 Obi-wan here, he would have just let himself be crushed, but because of his six episodic journey, this Obi-wan fights and saves himself. The next shot we see him literally crawl out this depression and confront the living manifestation of his deepest fears, regret and guilt; the phantom of his past - Vader. 

*And WINS.*

More to this, is that he overcomes his crushing (heh) guilt and past because of his love for Luke and Leia, because now, he has hope on the future. He believes in them. He fights for them. The past, Anakin, no longer matters. Luke and Leia is his new hope. At the end of the day, after devastating loss, we find something and someone new to fight for. That's how you heal.

Let's also talk about Vader for a sec. Vader literally wants to bury Obi-wan, also a living manifestation of his past, because that's what he wants to do in his mind. He wants to bury all traces of Anakin Skywalker. But of course it doesn't work. The Dark Side isn't exactly known for mental health seminars.

It's arguable whether this is Vader or Anakin, but I think it's Anakin that absolves him of his guilt. Vader at the end of the day, is Anakin. For me, this is Anakin, because Anakin is essentially saying, ""you didn't fail me, I failed myself. You were the best Master ever 10/10 I simply made my own choices"" in Vader style.  He's comforting him in his own way.

Only through Obi-wan confronting himself and Vader was he able to help Reva, and now, they are ""both free"" of the past. Later, we see Obi-wan smiling, laughing, hugging, reclaiming both Ben and Obi-wan, remembering Anakin and Padme without hurting and regaining his sense of self. It's beautiful to see. One of my favorite shots is this: 

&amp;#x200B;

[sorry for the quality ](https://preview.redd.it/ujs2kji7pl791.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f3f6b075fac952a7b042d24a83dcbb46a10cbc)

Because it's just so dang hopeful. Obi-wan finally mentally and physically leaves this dark place so he can finally move on in the new stage of his life. That's why he was only now able to commune with Qui-Gon, because he's finally healing. And we love that for him. If Obi-wan can do it, after literally losing everything, we can too. 

TLDR; Obi-wan Kenobi series is about mental health and connects depressed Obi-wan with sagely Obi-wan in New Hope

If you've reached this far, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I think people miss the point in Obi-wan"
starwars,"I recently rewatched the OT and I really don't understand how the 'stormtroopers always miss' stigma comes from. To prove my point, in A New Hope, the Imperial forces decimate the rebels on the Tantive IV, kill Lukes caretakers, and kill many jawas (albeit offscreen). They miss during the swinging scene with Luke and Leia, but that makes perfect sense. Hitting an object moving through the sky is very difficult, and the stormtroopers only \*narrowly\* miss their shots. 

In The Empire Strikes Back, they win the Battle of Hoth and miss occasionally during the chase but once again there was not only moving targets but also residents of Cloud City fighting back, plus abundant cover for our heroes.

In Return of the Jedi, although the Empire seems to be losing to the Ewoks, they still manage to turn the battle around until the second Death Star is destroyed and moral is understandably lost.  ([Here's a clip of proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKj9VGWyjBQ), go to 3:23 for the Imperial turnaround) Even before the Empire begins slaughtering the Ewoks they still manage to corner and pin down Leia and Han before the intervention of a rebel controlled AT-ST.

Rogue One is probably the biggest proof of the accuracy of the Empire's troops, as they slaughter the rebels at both Jedha and the Battle of Scarif. Both ended in massive rebel losses.

In any case, let's give our boys in white some respect Stormtroopers don't miss"
starwars,"I remember when my friends and I heard that Episode one was coming. It must have been 1997 or 1998 when we heard. I was 21 at the time and we talked nonstop about what the new trilogy would include.  
  
Immediately we thought of The Clone Wars being a major part of all three movies. Obi-Wan and Anakin being contemporaries, the same age, fighting alongside each other. I envisioned that because all three movies would be set during The Clone Wars, that the toll of war itself would have slowly damaged Anakin's body where he got an arm replaced, a new knee joint, and slowly he began to feel that mechanical parts were better than organic parts because they increased his strength and speed, until one battle left him needing a respirator. The increased oxygen in his blood gave him a continual rush, making him even more reckless than ever.  
  
My best friend had his own theory, which I kind of like better. Independent of the friendship between Obi-wan and Anakin, somewhere in the story, Anakin succumbs to some sort of flesh eating bacteria that cannot be stopped. Again, limbs and organs are slowly replaced with mech, and his mind starts to grow twisted and angry with the world. *And* this would have played into what Obi-wan told Luke in ROTJ that Vader was more machine than man: Obi-wan would have known of the disease and it's ongoing toll on his body.  
  
Additional: we also thought that it would have been such a great mind fuck for all star wars fans to learn that Obi-wan turned out to be the real father of Luke and Leia, and he had a secret affair with their mother. Reflecting on the Prequel movies"

starwars,I’m interested to get an opinion on one of my favorite Star Wars characters (though his life was cut short). How would have he compared to people like Akbar? Would he and his fleet been a big boost to the rebel war effort? How good of an admiral was Raddus?
starwars,"It's life day, and Vader saves a pregnant woman from a bounty hunter, Anakin wakes up and is in a relationship with padme , finding enjoyment in this alternate reality where Anakin is a fulfilled father, notices something wrong with his force sensitive children as it seems they've found a dark side. . . my pitch for a Vader show"
starwars,"I keep seeing posts discussing what exactly Reva’s motivations were in the last episode and most people have come to the conclusion that she wanted to kill Vader’s son as revenge. 

While the episode doesn’t outright say that this is true it does hint at it with her saying she wants “justice” and that killing Luke is that justice. 

I really hope this isn’t the case because the mental gymnastics she’d have to do to come to this conclusion is ridiculous. 

If order for her to figure out Luke is Anakin’s son she’d have to 

1. Know that Anakin was in a relationship with someone- something that she would know is directly prohibited for the Jedi. 

2. That his partner was pregnant. Something that almost no one knew at all. I believe only Anakin, Padme, and maybe Palpatine knew. Obi-wan only found out after Anakin had turned. 

3. That Padme’s child(ren) did not die with their mother. The only people who knew the kids survived the pregnancy were Kenobi, Yoda, the Lars, and the Organas. 

Not to mention that Reva was a child during all of these events living at the Jedi temple. 

I know people will argue that she could’ve pieced it together after listening to Bail’s message but she simply doesn’t have enough pieces of the puzzle.

What Reva does know by the finale is 

1. Leia isn’t an Organa and she may be force sensitive 

2. Kenobi is working with Organa and the Path 

3. Both Kenobi and Bail are working with the Lars on Tatooine to hide Luke 

The most logical conclusion to draw from this is that Luke is simply just a force sensitive child that Kenobi is trying to keep safe. Which adds up considering Reva sees Kenobi working with the Path the entire series. 

FAQ: 

“But she saw Anakin fall to the dark side. It’s not impossible for her to assume he had kids” 
-Falling to the dark side doesn’t automatically mean you’ll have a family. In fact I would be pretty hard pressed to believe a child killer would have kids of their own. 

“His last name is Skywalker. Surely she’d be able to figure it out” 
-She never learns of Luke’s last name. I’m also fairly certain Skywalker is a common last name in Star Wars. 

“Kenobi was close with Anakin and she knows he’s hiding the boy”
-So? GI literally gives a speech about how Jedi can’t help themselves trying to save people. Why would she think he’s any different 

TLDR: If Reva knows Luke is Anakin’s son then either she must be the smartest person in the galaxy or Vader and Palpatine are absolute idiots Reva should NOT know Luke’s heritage"

starwars,"Like many of you I love Star Wars and like many of you I grew up with Star Wars. I'm 47 though so you know what generation of Star Wars I come from. Coincidentally, I've got my original toy Han Solo blaster sitting next to me right now because my friend is 3D printing replacement battery cover knobs for it.

Having seen the original Star Wars in the theater multiple times as a kid it was difficult, to say the least, to fully accept the prequels as part and parcel of that mythology. Yes, I liked the prequels, but I never loved them. They were just too different in tone, too uneven in pacing and too predictable in general. The fall was preordained and yet something was missing. The link between Episode III and IV was tenuous at best. Lucas' reveal of Vader at the end of Episode III is unsatisfying at best. Obi-Wan Kenobi the series fixes that, but it also does a lot more.

# How do we get to the Obi-Wan in Episode IV?

In the opening of the series we find Kenobi a broken man. This man led massive armies into battle. He soundly defeated Anakin Skywalker in his prime. In single combat he killed General Grievous, a foe that had slain multiple Jedi in battle. Now we see he has been living for a decade with the trauma of killing his friend and it has broken him. He hasn't touched the Force in a long time. He does drudge work and watches Luke from afar, never having met the boy. He cowers when his discovery is likely. When he first encounters Vader, he is easily brought down.

How does this man, broken and beaten, become the person that takes Darth Maul down in Rebels, economically and easily with one quick strike. How does he become the cool, calm and collected presence in Episode IV that battles Vader to a standstill?

Kenobi has to care again, to confront his demons, to realize it's not all about his pain, that there are others suffering for and because of him. He has to find absolution and in confronting Vader he does.

# Vader is not even a challenge

It's a given that Kenobi survives this series, we know that, but what a shocking domination of Vader in the final episode. Kenobi is never really at a disadvantage. He harries Vader at every turn. Even when Vader seems to get one up on him and buries him under rubble we find Obi-Wan unhurt. As memories of his two charges run through his mind we can hear Yoda's voice, ""Size matters not"" before he hurls the rubble away with relative ease and bounds up and out of the hole. This is Obi-Wan returned to his full powers and perhaps more.

Watching this Obi-Wan battle Vader is what finally puts the confrontations in Episode III and IV into context with each other. Vader is revealed for what he is, a broken man, his powers diminished by his injuries. We understand now that he could never have defeated the most powerful Jedi of the Republic on his own as Vader. He liquidated the prime of the Jedi during the purge and never faces a real challenge afterward, until now.

# Episode III and IV come together through Christensen

Vader's words in this episode are Obi-Wan's final absolution.

""You didn't kill Anakin Skywalker... I did.""

This moment is what truly links Episodes III and IV and the main reason is the performance by Hayden Christensen. That he performed as Vader for the show without saying anything himself as Vader until this moment is what gives this scene so much power. 

Hearing Hayden's voice instead of James Earl Jones' and seeing Hayden's face behind that mask lit by the red light of his saber creates the first real nostalgia for the prequels for many older fans of Star Wars by firmly tying Episode III and IV together. Christensen expresses in one small scene how far the character has come from those films. We still see that innocent and impetuous young man behind the scars and when we see how resigned he is to his fate we truly understand why Vader is what he is in Episode IV and beyond. Christensen makes all of the movies better with this scene.

# Obi-Wan in Episode IV

We now know that Obi-Wan was not going to lose to Vader in their duel in Episode IV. This show and Rebels show that Kenobi's skills remain potent. Perhaps with the passage of time they are an even match, but more likely Obi-Wan never intends to defeat Vader. He has spent over a decade conferring with Qui-Gon and Yoda on what needs to happen. If he takes down Vader the Emperor will just put another Sith in Vader's place. The opening to defeating the Emperor is through Vader's love for Padme and by extension the children.

# Final Thoughts

It's interesting to consider that Obi-Wan, by the time of Episode IV, has been in contact with Qui-Gon for a decade or more. What do they do in that time? I hope they make more Obi-Wan episodes that explore this.

Especially now, knowing that Obi-Wan for sure could commune Qui-Gon, why does it take three years after Obi-Wan enters the Force for Obi-Wan to point Luke to Dagobah? What are he and Qui-Gon and Yoda debating in that time? Obi-Wan Kenobi has done something I never thought was possible. It's made me love the prequels."
starwars,"Episode 6 very much established his position within the Inquisitorial structure.  He is obviously subservient to Vader but is also almost in an advisory role not fearing to warn against Vader's immediate orders to follow Obi. More or less establishing that 

The grand inquisitor is intelligent

He works WITH Vader as a commander and not just someone he issues orders to. 

His demeanor while following Vader's orders shows that he disagrees with them but knows that once Vader says something twice you don't make him say it a 3rd time.

Vader respects him, his position, and his input

Even with his brief live action role, I think Kenobi did a great job really establishing the Grand Inquisitor as a powerful figure in the pre-rebellion era. I really dig the Grand Inquisitor's character in Kenobi."

starwars,"Spoilers for Kenobi to follow
___

One thing I loved about the final confrontation between Kenobi and Vader was the back and forth use of the force, both offensively and defensively. Which, makes sense. We should see Jedi/Sith/force sensitives utilize the force during battle. It's their greatest tool.

We should have ESPECIALLY seen it used by Rey and Kylo during the throne room fight in TLJ against NON force sensitive beings. It would have given them a clear advantage and made that 7 on 2 fight much more believable. Because as it stands, it makes little sense how the two would be able to defeat 7 highly trained guards wielding melee weapons via melee combat alone.


That's it, that's really all I had to say. I wish we saw the force used more often in battle like we did in Kenobi. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. That scene in the last Obi Wan episode shows how the Praetorian fight in TLJ could've been made way more believable"
starwars,"I love that the Kenobi series focused on Ben’s relationship with Leia. It makes me look at her asking him for help in ANH with a larger smile on my face knowing the history they had. But something that did make me sad was reminding myself that she barely sees Ben ever again. Leia asks for Ben’s help but is taken to the Death Star, then Ben goes to disable to tractor beam instead of going to the detention level to meet her and the only glimpse she gets of her old friend is when he is fighting Vader and dies sacrificing himself. Obviously Lucas had no idea in 1977 that Star Wars would have expanded to this size now since that scene only focuses on Luke seeing Ben. But you can see Leia turn to look as well, and her saying “Luke it’s too late!” and comforting him later on the Falcon just hits even harder now.

What reason does she actually have to kill Luke?

A strong independent lead role, not a damsel in distress and had a compelling character arc that entwined with Kenobi really well. I think her performance will be an inspiration and act as role model for a lot of youth. 

As a sith inquisitor, she nailed the character and how it was portrayed. I thought her arc to the light side was authentic and immersive. 

She did not feel like a quota pick whatsoever and Disney did well this time to actually give her a lead position over the entire series rather than what happened with Finn (he could have been made to become a Jedi).

Well done Moses Ingram! Reva, an appreciation post for the Kenoni series"
starwars,"Note: This got long so I put a TLDR at the end. I hope at least one person enjoys reading this though.

Following the end of the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, I was inspired to rewatch the Prequels. While watching Episode II I was struck with this idea that I wanted to post for others to enjoy and give their opinions. I want to say first off that I’m not calling anyone who enjoyed Luke’s sequel arc the way it was wrong, we all have our own taste and that is a good thing.

That being said, I personally was a bit bummed out by Luke’s reason for going into exile, and my idea is a simple change in his reason for going that would have made it work for me and likely others without any additional alterations. A change that would fit perfectly within Star Wars canon. 

The scene that inspired this was Anakin’s massacre of the Tusken camp, an unspeakable act that sent ripples through the force across the whole galaxy. An act of cold hearted revenge and anger. Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker’s son, and he is very similar to his father. Both headstrong, both love to fly, both care very deeply about their friends and loved ones. While Anakin showed some tendencies that could lead to the dark side throughout the movie such as pride and arrogance, it was revenge that truly sent him over the edge and down the dark path, which as Yoda told us would forever dominate his destiny. 

Now, how did this lead me to Luke in the sequels? Because think about what happened to Luke. Jedi Temple destroyed, all his students that didn’t turn to the dark side killed as far as we know. The reason we’re given for him exiling himself after is that Luke blamed himself because he drove Ben to the dark side. However, as canon has continued to expand we see that Luke truly did become a Jedi Master in every sense of the term. We also see that Luke knew about Snoke and the Knights of Ren, supposedly defeating Snoke at one point. It is heavily implied that Snoke/Palpatine feared Luke, and needed him out of the way before he was willing to act openly. It wouldn’t have taken long for Luke to realize Snoke had been manipulating Ben and turning him against him.

So here is my thought. Canon suggests that Luke could have defeated Ben and Snoke, maybe not at the same time but they were rarely together. He could have defeated Snoke and dealt a major blow to the growing First Order, then been a major force in stopping their growth. So how could this great Jedi Master go into exile and leave the galaxy at the mercy of the Sith in a way that satisfies all Star Wars fans? 

It links back to Anakin and the Tuskens. Luke cared for his friends/padawans so much he is prone to revenge. No matter how much he meditated, no matter how much he tried to let it go in his heart when he went after Snoke and the Knights of Ren he knew he would be acting out of revenge. 

He could forgive Ben, his nephew and former apprentice. But he foresaw the only outcome of his final confrontation with him and Snoke/Palpatine being him giving into his anger. Giving into the dark side, like his father and his nephew. Becoming the Vader Palpatine dreamed of when he started turning Anakin, a Sith truly worthy of surpassing Sidious.

And so, feeling it better than the alternative Luke goes into exile. Not because he’s moping, not because he can’t face his mistake. Because he truly believes by leaving he is protecting the galaxy.

TLDR: Luke should have gone into exile because he foresaw himself unable to let go of his anger and striking Snoke down out of revenge, giving into the dark side like his father and nephew. He would believe he was protecting his friends and the galaxy from himself, and was justified in his decision. As someone who’s fictional hero was Luke growing up, this would have made the exile work for me. A Simple Change to Luke’s Motivation For Exile That Would Have Satisfied (Almost) All Fans - Inspired by A Post Kenobi Prequel Rewatch"
starwars,"I think the Obi-Wan Kenobi finale was a mixed bag, but the series overall had a lot to like. And with the way that it ended, it seems like the door was deliberately kept open for future Obi-Wan adventures down the line. That being said, a lot of the obvious Kenobi story beats were hit in the first season with the Vader/Kenobi rematch, a Qui-gon cameo, and a plot about Leia/Bail Organa. The other issue is that Tatooine in general has been done TO DEATH. A lot of Tatooine stuff you'd think could end up in a Kenobi show was burned through in The Mandalorian and in Boba Fett (Tusken Raisers, Krayt Dragon, wandering samurai hero). 

A potential season 2 would be really different from the first, but could still be interesting. Story-wise it's also a lot more open. So my question is: what kind of story would you like to see? 

A few possible stories off the top of my head:

* A *Yojimbo* inspired story, where Obi-Wan plays two rival gangs on Tatooine against one another in order to protect a village. The gangs could also pose some kind of threat to Luke. Kenobi could even go under cover as a mercenary to infiltrate the gangs, kind of like he did as Rako Hardeen on the Clone Wars. 
* A story with Obi-Wan's brother. That was a little thread introduced in season 1. I definitely think we could end up meeting the brother, seeing them team-up on some kind of adventure, and maybe learn a bit about Obi-Wan's family and home planet. The set-up for this story would be tricky, but there's some potential for sure. 
* A story involving a tribe of Tusken Raiders that have seemingly become more aggressive and much more powerful. Obi-Wan investigates and learns that they are being corrupted and empowered by the dark side of the Force, and that there's a Fallen Jedi on Tatooine. This could be some version of A'Sharad Hett from the old EU. We could see a *Seven Samurai* style defense of a village against a huge raid from the Tuskens, and a clash between Obi-Wan and the Dark Jedi controlling them. 

So what are some of your ideas? Pitch a story for Kenobi, Season 2"

On a more positive note then Obi Wan vs Anakin fight was great and when Obi Wan said ' I will do what I must ' and Darth Vader saying ' you will try gave me chills

Unfortunately, Book of Boba Fett and Obi-Wan, although enjoyable in their own respects, were not nearly as enjoyable for me, in spite those two shows featuring my favorite two characters in the entire franchise. The directing and the writing decisions severely hampered my enjoyment of both shows. 

A particular sequence in the last episode of Obi-wan was about one of the best moments I've seen from live action SW, and yet I don't find myself being able to recommend the series in its entirety to others.

starwars,"First of all, feel free to define ""Golden Age"" any way you want - what I'm mainly interested in is why people feel that way about their chosen era.

For me, the Golden Age of Star Wars was the 90s. The decade started off with the release of Timothy Zahn's ""Heir to the Empire"", which I bought as soon as I saw it in a store, quickly devoured, and was left hungry for more. I didn't have to wait long, because shortly after that the two remaining parts of the trilogy were released, and then the floodgates opened as far as books were concerned. I read almost every Star Wars book that was published for the remainder of the decade - some of them were great, some just good, and some... well, I still read them anyway because I was just enjoying the opportunity for more Star Wars content. 🙂

In the middle of the decade, the THX remastered versions of the movies came out, and Star Wars had never looked better on a TV screen; I'm pretty sure I watched the entire trilogy nearly once a week for a long time. Once I got access to the internet I was able to find some really cool Star Wars sites, and that was where I first saw pictures and descriptions of some of the deleted scenes from the movies, as well as lists of bloopers in the movies, which I printed out and kept with me while I watched them, seeing how many of them I could spot.

1997 saw the release of the Special Editions, and Star Wars was headed back to the big screen. I lived in a small town at the time that only had a small movie theatre with a single screen, so *A New Hope* was the only one I actually got to see in a theatre at the time, but the experience was magical. I got the VHS box set once it was released, and at that point I had two versions of the movies to enjoy, which was awesome.

And of course, you can't talk about Star Wars in the 90s without mentioning *The Phantom Menace*.  The buzz for this movie was like nothing else I have ever experienced - I first heard about the prequels around 1993, so while all of the content I mentioned above was being released, in the background there was a huge amount of anticipation for the first new Star Wars movie in over a decade. I still remember how exciting it was seeing the first concept art online, and all the speculation about what might happen in the movies. That was also the first time I ever watched a movie trailer online - the video was about the size of a credit card so it was hard to pick out all the details, but seeing young Anakin, young Obi-Wan, Padme, and Darth Maul for the first time was undeniably awesome. Oh, and the movie itself? It's not my favourite Star Wars movie, but I still love it and would gladly watch it any day over most other movies I've ever seen. The lightsaber duel is also still my favourite - seeing a couple of Jedi and a Sith, all in their prime, was a game changer and raised the bar for all lightsaber duels going forward.

Now, your turn - what's your Star Wars Golden Age? What, in your opinion, is the Golden Age of Star Wars?"
starwars,It seems like Disney didn’t really care about being realistic and just wanted to shove in the fact that they got Hayden back to play Vader   like he’s breathing all fucked up while kenobis talking but then as soon as Vader starts speaking he just sounds angry not really anything else to his voice which is pretty dumb honestly seems like another example of Disney dumbing down the script to fit their cash grab entertainment And the whole idea of kenobi breaking his helmet in the scene also feels like another way of them just being like look!

If they made a Vader series, that would mean making Vader the protagonist… and how do you make one of the most notorious movie villains of all time a protagonist, without making some kind of watered down, “good guy” version of Vader? Be honest is that what you want to see? No one would enjoy that because that’s not Vader. We saw what happened when they gave Boba Fett (a bad guy) his own series. Since he was the protagonist, he became soft and boring and morally right, which let’s be honest, was not as fun. In a series about vader we would not be getting any scenes of him dragging people through the streets, or killing children, or lighting people on fire , because unfortunately that’s not the way Hollywood works, we have to be able to root for the protagonist.

2. Vader is better in small doses. He commands more fear and attention when he is on screen in smaller doses, and that’s the reason you love him whether you know it or not. A whole series about Vader would be hard to pull off because he would lose his fear factor and mystery very quickly if we spend every minute with him on screen. It would destroy the essence of his character. 


The only way to do Vader properly is to leave him as the bad guy, which is we literally just got a whole series about with Kenobi. Just be thankful for what you were just given and stop asking for more and more all the time,especially when there is no need. Why a Vader series would be a very BAD idea …"
starwars,"Am I remembering correctly that we've only seen 3 western style duels and Cad Bane was in and won all 3? (Hunter, Cobb Vanth, Boba Fett) I can't recall any others we've seen Am I right on this?"
starwars,"Both combatants showed extreme force proficiency in their climatic duel in the Obi Wan series. It seems to me Vader still has the upper hand in terms of raw force power, but what do you think? Who’s stronger in the force: Obi Wan or Vader?"
starwars,"Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson could all return. A man can dream... If Disney ever does a ""what if"" series for Star Wars, I would love to see Hayden Christensen as light side Anakin."
starwars,"Why did Kenobi let Vader live? Like now that he believes Vader killed Anakin and no longer feels so guilty for “killing” him, he should kill him, no? Otherwise you’re letting a genocidal, mass murdering, dark side insane, killing machine maniac continue wreaking havoc on he galaxy. I loved the last episode but there’s something that makes no sense to me."
starwars,"What are everyone's thoughts on Disney breaking this rule ? On the face of it I don't mind too much, but when I think about it, it feels wrong to not have them for the first 6 movies as a rule and then the sequels and Disney+ shows are constantly throwing them about all the time contradicting that, it goes against the identity of Star Wars for me. ""There's no flashbacks in Star Wars"" -George Lucas"
starwars,Leia naming her son Ben is a lot more powerful now. Just a thought Ben Solo
starwars,"I see a lot of people complaining about Obi-Wan Kenobi, and after finishing the last episode yesterday, I've come to the conclusion that it's not really a surprise that myself and many others didn't like it. I have this exact same feeling after watching the vast majority of Star Wars releases.

I think the reality is that many of us have grown to love the video games and spin-off's but not the actual movies/series. The movies have always been cheesy, and that's something the 'real' fans will absolutely adore.

If you didn't like it, you may want to question whether you're in the same bracket as me. Do you really like the Star Wars franchise, or do you just like the spin-offs, i.e KOTOR / SWTOR / Clone Wars. I've come to the conclusion that I love the concept of Star Wars, just not the execution."
starwars,"Well, the first half of the series wasn't that good, but when mando joined in on the fun, things got soo much better. The ending with mando and grogu speeding off into space withe the manalorian's theme was just so cool. I'm really gonna miss grogu and the mandalorian. But, I would've liked if grogu somehow took both the lightsaber and the armour. I'm kinda sad that grogu never got ro finsih his training. What do tou think? just finished book of boba fett"
starwars,"So we know about Vader's own chamber, could he interface directly with the spaceships in his control? Not only say Force manipulation, but say direct control of the ship through interfacing by connecting to the ship? You know how R2 is able to access terminals? Could Vader do the same? Q: Could Vader directly interface with Spaceships?"
starwars,"I wonder why there is no back-up memory for the droids. Like when l3-37 or K-2SO died all my friends would be sad for their scene while I'm like just get the backup memory, get a new body, and move on. But, the heroes or anyone never do a backup memory on the droids. I maybe a asshole with no feeling, but if my best friend was a droid I would back up their memories every day in case the droid gets destroyed. Why there's no backup memory for the droids?"
starwars,"Obiwan would have killed vader, if given the chance. There is no reason to walk away, Why would you give up a chance to do exactly what you wanted/needed to do? The whole point of the original trilogy is that vader and the emperor .....need to be killed! To save the galaxy!! Obiwan would have killed vader and that's why this whole series is a fan service what if. I do not accept it as cannon, just like I don't accept that trash of a sequel trilogy! Obiwan vs vader ep.6 breaks Canon!"
starwars,I want to get my first custom saber.but i can only use shopeepay or touch n go ewallet or boost.is there any good saber vendor that accept these ewallet? Does Sabertrio accept these ewallet as payment method? I want to get my first custom saber
starwars,"[SPOILER]So I’m not a big stars wars fan but at the end of obi wan earth Vader says “yes my master”. I thought darth Vader was the top dog, is this like a new reveal or did everybody already know this? I’m confused on the ending of obi wan show, help?"
starwars,"One thing I really dislike about Kenobi and Book of Boba is your choice of location for the final battles. I seriously don't understand why you didn't use the jabba palace and Vader's castle as final battle place. You could have done so much with it. And could have showed us so much from it. Make it to place an history where actual important things happened. But instead you choose random locations. Makes me really sad.

And yeah I know, you will have some explanations why it wouldn't work plotwise as how it is right now. But I really think it's not that much of a deal to focus on the most epic things that are possible in a certain scenario and write the plot around that events. One thing I really dislike about KENOBI an BOOK OF BOBA"
starwars,"Hello there.
I only read Darth Bane 10 years ago. Maybe the second novel of it? Rule of two was it ? Or something else. Something good. I liked Darth Bane novel a lot. Maybe more of him in comics or so ?
Cheers! Any Star Wars novel you can recommend ? / Sny Darth Bane Media you can recommend?"
starwars,"So I’ve just finished lords of the Sith and I’m on an empire binge, any other darth Vader novels worth looking at? Darth Vader novels"
starwars,"Listen, I was one of the biggest advocates for Kenobi series. Ewan McGregor, back as Obi Wan, in a period where he is transitioning Ben Kenobi? Faced against Darth Vader in his prime? Hell, sign me up!  


But like many people, I was concerned about one very dangerous thing that all prequels face before success - stakes. 

I was really worried that the series will focus on the ultimate fate of Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia and Anakin. Meaning, the show will play on the viewer the 'will he survive this episode' card, or 'what kind of trouble could our main hero be in?' card. Things that Star Wars fans, hell, even those who just know general things about Stat Wars, wouldn't care about.

We know everyone makes it to ANH. We know how and where everyone ends up. What was the point of Reva chasing Luke in the final episode? What was the point of Reva facing against Owen? What was the point of the whole plotline with Leia? Hell, I would be okay if those were characters we knew little about, and this was a chance to find out more about them - but we know Leia arugably MORE than anyone! While I did enjoy what I saw of her, with all due respect - this is an Obi-Wan show...None of those side plotlines were significant enough to divert our attention from Obi-Wan so much. 

The only characters I actually cared about (except Obi-Wan) was Tala. But again, that whole plotline was literally from Rogue One's script. 

What I am trying to say is that either this series should have introduced brand new characters for Obi-Wan to go on a journey along, or just be a 1.30 hours movie about Obi-Wan overcoming his guilt about Anakin. But I really felt nothing whenever Leia, Luke or even Obi-Wan were in 'grave danger'. Why I think Kenobi didn't work for many people (including me)"
starwars,"Apart from the obvious ""episode 1"" in the titles, in chronological order, what other movies that are on disney + should i watch I have never watched star wars. In which order should i start watching?"
starwars,"Obviously his story would need to be changed a little but I think the “Vader’s secret apprentice” idea could still work. And of course I know people will complain about his abilities so naturally they’d have to be toned down a little bit. I know he may never become canon again but he’s honestly one of my favorite characters. It’s not just his powers that make him cool, starkiller (and his clone) had an amazing story worth telling. But I think in essence, there’s nothing stopping Lucasfilm from bringing him back. Thoughts? Is there any way or any chance to make Starkiller canon again?"
starwars,"I want to know how the Organa’s were able to explain why Leia was with Obi-Wan. Leia was captured by Reva so surely the Empire knew they were involved with Obi-Wan, along with the group that helps Jedi in hiding/rebels. 

ALSO, what did Owen and Beru tell Luke after Reva attacked him? Did he wonder why a lady with a red lightsaber was trying to find him and that, for that reason, he might be special? How do they explain THAT? (Obi-Wan)"
starwars,"I can't help feeling that there are very few works in the franchise that make him really intimidating and I really want him to be because it makes for better drama and it makes it REALLY mean something if another character escapes from him or defeats him.

Empire established his power the most out of the original trilogy; there's a little jankiness to the fight scenes there that makes them a little less intimidating but that's understandable for a movie that old. 

But in later media where he's established to be so monstrously powerful that the Emperor can only control him now that he's lost 4 limbs and spends his life in physical and psychological agony, he should be an absolute force of nature.

It's a bit like Worf from Star Trek: TNG. We take it for granted that he's very strong so he gets defeated by people to illustrate THEIR strength. But the more you do that the more the character feels like a punching bag. 

It seems to be only stuff outside the main series that hits the note I'm looking for. The ending scene of Rogue One was awesome and his appearance in Jedi: Fallen order was appropriately scary to me. 

What do you think? Is there a piece of media I'm missing? Am I judging too harshly on some of the other media? Look forward to hearing what y'all think. In what piece of Star Wars media do you feel that Darth Vader is the most intimidating? Does this affect how you enjoy Star Wars media"
starwars,"Cal Kestis is the protagonist of Jedi: Fallen Order. But since he is a playable game character, he doesn't have an actual storyline, right? I mean, the person playing the game can controll him as he/ she wishes. I mean things like his lightsaber color or who he kills. We, the players can decide that, so what is his actual canon story? What is Cal Kestis' canon story?"
starwars,"Since the Disney acquisition of Star Wars in 2014, what do believe is the the best piece of Star Wars media we’ve got. Some of the best pieces in my opinion would have to be: The Clone Wars Season 7, The Mandalorian, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rogue One, Jedi Fallen Order, the Darth Vader comics and many more. Personally my favourite would have to be the final four episodes of The Clone Wars Season 7, the Siege of Mandalore story arc. What is the best piece of Star Wars media since the Disney acquisition?"
starwars,"Ok, I’m seeing a lot of chat online about this and I have to ask. Did Anakin stab Reva at the temple when she was a youngling?
I didn’t think he did, I read the scene as it being how Reva saw it in her head as Vader finally got her. But many seem to think she survived twice being stabbed by a lightsaber in the same place by - from a certain point of view - the same person. 
Am I wrong? Question about Anakin and Reva during Order 67"
starwars,After watching the amazing fight scene with obi wan and Vader in the kenobi finale I was very confused. I rewatched episode 3 and after Anakin kills the separatists on mustafar he is crying because he does not want to do the things he is doing. Although there is still some Anakin in Vader during kenobi their fight scene made it seem like Anakin has completely vanished and it is just Vader. I know it has been 10 years but how the hell does Vader take over his personality as much as kenobi portrayed. How did Vader take over Anakin so fast?
starwars,"I can't stop watch last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi

Is it just me?
I keep watching the last episode (among others) every day. I don't think I will ever be over ""I am not your failure Obi-Wan"". This line hit is me hard. I did not expect this at all.


I think we can all agree that Obi-Wan Kenobi is a great series.


And I love the character of Leia in the series. I can't stop watching the last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi"

starwars,I've never played either of them but am very interested because I've heard good things. But are they worth playing on PS3 in 2022? Ik that there you can stream them on PS4/5 but streaming games sucks ass so I'm just going to buy the PS3 discs which don't bother me. Are the Force Unleashed games still worth it?
starwars,"Hello guys, somewhat of a casual Star Wars fan here so I’m not sure about power-scaling. I just wanted to know if mace defeating Palpatine makes him stronger than yoda who was unable to do so Was Mace windu stronger than Yoda?"
starwars,I honestly have not looked into a lot of the planets that aren’t shown a lot or just were used a lot in the shows. So I’m hoping to learn of some new ones What is your favorite underrated or just not known planet?
starwars,"I don’t browse this subreddit often so no idea if this is r/popularopinion material, but what the title says. There could’ve been a solid 2 hour story focused on Obi-Wan and seeing the last confrontation between him and Vader would’ve been insane in IMAX or Dolby. The sound design in that scene deserved that scale. Obi-Wan Shpuld’ve Been a Movie"
starwars,"We don't often get to glimpse behind the mask. It's forbidden. But when we do it's chilling. We shouldn't be seeing this.

We see tortured Anakin. We see a vengeful Vader. We're surprised and sad and scared.

I looked at some scenes from Clone Wars and The Revenge Of The Sith after watching this episode. I have a new deep sadness for what happens to Anakin. 

It truly is a harrowing tale. Obi-Wan Kenobi's final episode's startling impact."
starwars,"Earlier today I saw a write up someone had done that was a few paragraphs long and about Obi Wan and Vader right before they started dueling. 

I don't remember specifically what was said but I believe thd last line was something about there being a moment of peace before their sabers ignited where there was ""no conflict, only memories""

I've spent hours looking and haven't been able to find it again. If anyone knows what I am talking about please link me to it! looking for a post/comment I saw earlier"
starwars,"Ewan has said he is up for another ride in the Jedi robes as Obi Wan. What ideas do people have for another mini series arc that could be done with this character in a season 2? 

Personally I would LOVE to see an Ashoka/ Obi Wan reunion and joint side quest story. What are your thoughts? What story could they do in a season 2 of Obi Wan Kenobi?"
starwars,How does a guy with probably the most access to resources in the galaxy not have Beskar armor? Vader's weak helmet
starwars,"I know we are all star wars fans and love this series of movies, shows and lore all together, but sometimes I listen to the questions people ask these actors and they just sound so ridiculous. I think some forget that these people are not only just actors but real people with other interests and connections to the real world around us. I think it's a shame that certain actors that don't have quite the calabar of experience outside these movies get constantly associated with the one role they performed, and are forever identified with that one thing Hayden Christensen has incredible patience"
starwars,"He totally moved out of his cave and left his loyal droid buried in the sand!

Maybe he's guarding Grevious's lightsaber collection for him? 

That's probably it. Too many to rebury.

He's got to remember that he owned a droid at some point, right? Kenobi &amp; Droids"
starwars,"He lost 4 out of 4 times trying to get rid of Kenobi, he never finished the fight against Ahsoka, he couldn't stop rogue one team from stealing the death star blueprint, or Cal Kestis from the holocron, or get Luke to turn dark side... what does this guy actually achieve? If Vader is so good, why does he fail nine out of ten times?"
starwars,"There. We covered everyone in the past, present and future.

Stop farming for Karma. Shout out to everyone who ever had, or ever will have, anything to do with Star Wars"
starwars,Is there any cannon source answers where leia found out and was told of uncle Owen and aunt beru Cannon question
starwars,"When Darth Vader and Obi-Wan are fighting in the final episode, just right after Vader used the force to open a hole in the ground to cover Obi-Wan with stones, I was expecting him to say: “now I have the high ground”.

What you guys think? Loved the show (Kenobi), but missed one line."
starwars,"But how does Obi-Wan learn how to become a force ghost? Because, at least according to Clone Wars, a Jedi must go to a *lot* of planets and destinations on the way. But Obi-Wan stays on Tatooine except for his little adventure in the Kenobi show. Unless there is some sort of other way to learn the gift or &gt;!Qui-Gon’s force ghost shows Obi-Wan how to become one!&lt;, this is a pretty big plot hole. Did i miss something?"
starwars,But failed to. So HE is responsible for the destruction of Alderan and all of Vader’s atrocities. Discuss. Obiwan had the chance to end Vader’s reign of terror.
starwars," Im digging deeper into the lore and fantasy of SW, but Ive been wondering What would have been the right story lines? Or the Universally accepted best storylines? 

Ones with just as great adventure? 
Some of the book cannons? (Never read them) 
Is there a universally accepted story line the fans loved?
Is there a nerds rendition out there that went viral that all the fans love and Disney hates it?

Cause it feels like it fizzels out in the end and is just some kind of 3 episode long filler with half par characters, Reys the strongest? Ben just. Idk, didnt seem like a true vilian. It kinda just ends blandly? 

And is there a better prequal trilogy storyline that was more fire than the movies? 

And what do fans agree, about all the shitty loopholes and hating on Ryan Johnson? And poor uses of actresses well never get back?

Thanks, I know its alot. But Im in it to win it! All answers appreciated! What would have been the right story lines?"
starwars," I don't think Anakin ever redeemed himself in Return of the Jedi. 

What did he do, exactly? **He killed someone who he believed was threatening his family. That's the exact same thing he did with Mace in Episode III.** Anakin/Vader as a character would do **anything** for his family, with all the implications that that entails. 

That's why I find him so interesting as a character. His allegiances change completely, his appearance changes drastically, but he has always had the same motivations, the same inner drive. In some ways, he never changes. 

He never truly chains himself to any concept of morality, whether that means threatening Admiral Trench in the Clone Wars, slaughtering children to save his wife, choking out his admirals as Lord Vader, or overthrowing his master to save his child. Jedi and Sith Codes, the general policy of military superiors to their underlings, Imperial or Republic law; it doesn't matter. All that matters is family, regardless of what he has to do to achieve that aim.

**If ROTJ Anakin, lying on the floor dying, was given the choice to either kill a roomful of younglings again or lose Luke, I don't think he would have hesitated to re-enact Order 66.** Vader never redeemed himself, but he did the right thing for the wrong reasons, and that ended up killing him and turning him into an undeserved martyr figure. Hot Take - Vader never turned back to the light side"
starwars,"How Vader instantly backed down the second Palpatine questioned his quest for Kenobi? After seeing Vader make all these poor choices in his unsatiable thirst for Obi-wan’s blood, Palps shuts it down in a sentence. THAT was chilling… Is no one going to talk about…"
starwars,Why did Obi Wan just walk off at the end and not finish off Vader? Didn’t he say he wanted to finish this off one way or the other earlier in the episode? Question about the Obi Wan finale (spoiler)
starwars,"Did anyone else notice that in the ""flashback"" Anakin was using the vader saber? It was 100% not the Anakin/Luke lightsaber in that scene. Has anyone noticed this yet?? Vader saber???"

starwars,"Im rewatching it, and im about to watch Rogue one, but I keep thinking about this prophecy and balence to the force. 
Is that when vader, saves luke? Is that the ""balence""? 
Or is Rey the balence? okay maybe Im not tracking. The prophecy, is it Anikin or Rey?"
starwars,"I'll just start by saying that Obi-Wan had been my favorite SW character since the prequels. I grew up with just enough time to watch the OT religiously and play a bunch of N64 games to fully know all the characters but still be a child when the prequels came out in theaters. 

That all being said getting to see Obi-Wan y developed into the character that he had, the pinnacle of what it means to be a Jedi has been a blast. Literally, no other character, except maybe yoda, has demonstrated the values of being a Jedi more than Obi, and I would say that only because we have seen him go through so much and still stay true to it where yoda has always been a bit removed from hardship. He never knew this family, somewhere resentfully, saw his father figure die Infront of him, his brother/son betrayed him and destroyed everything he never loved and after all that he still can't bring himself to kill him. He maybe made a mistake there, showing mercy to a killer who went on to keep killing, but he also showed unconditional love and empathy. 

In modern films and movies we see a lot of ""good"" characters get taken down a peg and see a bit of their dark side but I have to say it's refreshing to see one who is just unshakable. One who will never succumb, never stop being who he is. 

Obi is also not a child of destiny or some great character meant to bring an end to evil, but his character shows us that talent and destiny doesn't necessarily create the strongest warrior, or the wisest sage. Quiet, hard work and dedication result in the undefeatable. Obi-Wan has defeated Anakin/Vader in every encounter(when at his prime), who many believe to be the most powerful force user even above old palps. Even when Vader finally does defeat obi, it's only because Obi surrenders and allows it. 

So cheers to the dude who can't be broken, to the most powerful and truest Jedi we have yet to see. Tribute to Obi-Wan Kenobi"
starwars,Everything from the choreography to the actual effects used in the Disney era fights are sub standard to me. I would say that Kylo’s light saber is definitely the most original and visually interesting one to look at but pretty much everything else just leaves me underwhelmed. I just saw a clip of Anakin vs Dooku in episode II and I was like dang that just looks good. The choreography was just so much more intense. No lightsaber fight post Disney is as satisfying as even the worst one in the prequels.
starwars,"Their fight was incredibly satisfying in the way it tightened up some aspects of ANH - it gives precedence to how Kenobi and Vader feel about each other, gives greater depth and sense to lines like ""Only a master of evil, Darth"" and ""when I left you I was but a learner"". But from a purely non-nitpicky fan standpoint, something I was blown away by was just how bad it made me feel for Vader. Kenobi wailing on his chest plate, Vader's wheezing, his cry in pain when slashed across the back - I honestly welled up. I wanted Kenobi to leave him alone in that moment. 

This show has spent so much time exploring just how brutal and despicable Vader is that you normally wouldn't feel any sympathy for him if it were any other villain, but in an instant he's transformed from a faceless, murderous monster to a vulnerable, crippled and pitiful husk. Combined with the flashback from ep. 5, I feel it gives an excellent depth to Vader's insecurity of never being able to best his master, despite being arguably more powerful/talented. Their exchange at the end, with Kenobi tearfully apologizing and Vader's reply being a glimmer of Anakin before being swallowed back by the dark side was heartbreaking, and gives greater precedence and meaning to their confrontation on the Death Star.

I know there's been mixed reaction to the series but this was a huge highpoint for me and made the entire thing worth it. This confrontation between them was necessary and could have been bungled in so many different ways - but I felt it was excellently done. I'm truly satisfied having it be part of the larger story and canon.

Curious as to what other people think of the minutiae of this scene. Something I really appreciated about the confrontation between Vader and Kenobi."
starwars,"Why why why would they have Kenobi acknowledge verbally that Anakin is no more, and that only an evil Darth remains, and then walk away without finishing him?? Thats the show telling us that it’s okay for Kenobi to kill Vader and prevent so much suffering to come. Why would they write him to make the exact same fucking mistake as Episode 3? 

An easy fix, have Obi Wan sense during the fight that Luke was in mortal danger. That gives Obi Wan a valid reason to leave Darth Vader and head back to Tattooine. 

So many plot points are driven by rationale that I can’t turn my brain off to enjoy. And my biggest gripe is that there really was no story worth telling. Reva’s plan for revenge made no sense, and her turn to the light was obvious and done so poorly. I’m so frustrated by the writing in Kenobi."
starwars,"I just think the way it wrapped up was so well done. I literally was tearing up at the ending conversation between Vader and Obi-Wan. 

Not just that, but I think it did a good job of moving Kenobi along emotionally and set him up in a good spot for where we find him again in ANH. I feel a second season would just mess it up and add an unneeded story. Plus, it couldn't have the emotional weight of this season without REALLY screwing some stuff up and making more plotholes. 

I guess, I'm just hoping Disney leaves well enough alone. Am I the only one that DOESN'T want a Kenobi season 2?"
starwars,In my opinion Vader solos he can just choke him and snap his neck and if he tries to escape on a ship Vader can hold it back then if that doesn’t work Star destroyers stop his ship Darth Vader vs thanos (no stones)
starwars,"It is fair to say that JJ probably pitched a meeting before the tirlogy began regarding the overall trilogy arc. Something to the effect of ""Rey is a mystery girl who struggles to be accepted, and the Skywalker family decide in the end that she is alright and that she can be a sspiritual Skywalker despite initial concerns of her Palpatine DNA. Light redeems dark, love conquers all, etc"". Meeting was something like that I'll bet, and if you pitched it that way to a random sample of star wars fans, it would probably get a good response. Someone could make a real good story with that idea, and very similar stories have done so like avatar: the last airbender to thunderous applause. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I love it to death now, I don't think the trilogy is in any position to be spoken of in the same breath as other highly intricately layered stories like Dune, better call saul/breaking bad or attack on titan where the plot happens in a manner that the audience thinks they understand it, until the plot twists in just the right way to simultaneously prove us wrong and wonder why we never saw the twit coming from a mile away. Nah, the ST is a bit too loose to be elevated so high. But I am at a point that I believe much of its problems can be repaired with other stories to fill it in although I have no idea what that might look like. With caveats though, such as emperor Palpatine himself in the flesh is one thing I probably will never accept because why doesn't anybody ever die in star wars?! I'm including Dave Filoni in this complaint too, probably more than JJ and Rian because this has been a thing ever since Maul. Before Maul people only came back as spirits. Dave is one of the main people doing these things, and I bet JJ thought it was weird that its okay when Dave does it.

I don't know how to end this mini-rant, and the previous paragraph feels inadequate... I think my opinion on the ST has improved but it has a ways to go before I decide that I like the thing. My sense of charity has grown to a point that I now consider it an exaggeration to say that the sequels didn't have a plan."
starwars,"My feeds are chock full of click bait and shock ads for Star Wars ""news"". I'm aware of the Mike Zeroh guy (bonkers tabloid Star wars news). What's a good site to find reliable rumors?  I'm over the ""Will Obi-wan kill Luke?"" kind of trash and would love to be able to find a site or two that isn't eye-rolling. Thanks in advance! Where to get my Star Wars news?"
starwars,"My three biggest takeaways since I've only watched the TV shows, movies, and video games:

1. Darth Vader already has a reputation for being evil after killing younglings, executing Order 66, and being the enforcer of the Empire. But killing innocent people for no reason in episode 3 reminded me of how evil he really was.

2. I wasn't impressed with Darth Vader's lightsaber duels or mastery of the force in live action until now. We got to see Darth Vader dominate Obi-Wan in episode 3, toy around with Reva in episode 5, and also stop a starship in episode 5.

3. Although Darth Vader is presented as an unstoppable force, he can still be defeated just like in the season finale. How has your opinion of Darth Vader changed after the Obi-Wan Kenobi show?"
starwars,"In Star War Episode 6 Return of the Jedi, Luke is unmasking Vader and a deep cut is shown on the right hand side of his head.

Which gets me thinking did Obi Wan Kenobi give him that cut from him slicing Vaders mask? Just realised something after watching Obi Wan Kenobi finale"
starwars,"I purchased years ago a sith code and grey Jedi code t-shirts. On the front it had a sith and the sith code on the back for the sith shirt, and the same done for the grey Jedi. I’ve gotten bigger and can’t fit into them anymore. I can’t find online anywhere that has that shirt design. If anyone can point me in the right direction I’d appreciate it. Find t-shirt"
starwars,"When Obi-Wan is apologizing to Anakin while tearing up, it really hit. I grew up with the clone wars and the prequels so it really felt tragic for me to watch. Anyone else tear up when that one scene happened"
starwars,"This was a fairly small detail and wasn’t that crucial to the plot but I thought it was a cool touch. When Obi Wan was covered with rocks that Vader threw on him, he struggled to find the strength to lift them up. Dark thoughts and memories flooded his mind(especially thoughts of him losing anakin), and he still couldn’t find it within himself to lift them. But then thoughts of Leia and Luke(the new hopes) come to him, he found the strength within him to escape. This is very true to the character of Obi Wan, since hatred, sadness, and anger were never the source of any of his strength, and he is a truly pure character. I think it was cool to see them show that his true strength came from good rather than his anger and loss. Small detail from Obi Wan finale."
starwars,"Finished Fallen Order for the second time not long ago and I'm irked that we don't have a clone wars error Jedi game.

You can tell almost any story you want, there's a plethora of different organic and non organic combatant options and you don't have to worry about how presumably by ESB there are no more Jedi sans Luke. 

You can tell the story from the perspective of a master training a padawan like Anakin and Ahsoka from the TCW cartoon. Last game could end like Halo Reach with order 66 and the last level being survive and the fate of the padawan/knight could be left up in the air or they could've died at the end of the previous level.

You can have the characters meet established characters like Obi Wan and Yoda for guidance.

starwars,"We (the audience) and Obi-Wan (in universe) both waited the same length of time to see Qui-Gon again - 23 years.

We last saw Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon in Episode I in 1999. In-universe, ten years passed between Episodes I and II, another three between II and III, and then ten more years between III and the Obi-Wan Kenobi series. It tugged at my heartstrings to see our old friend again, and now even more so to realize how long it’s been. I had a neat little realization about *the cameo* in the Kenobi finale"
starwars,"I think I was pretty much with everyone else at the start of the series, not quite buying the character and not knowing of it was the actress or the writing. But now I think it would be really interesting to see her character return at some later date.

We still don’t really know what all she is capable of or where her need to need for vengeance might take her. Reva, hear me out:"

I don’t wanna spoil too much, or really anything because the movie is full of twists but, I’ll give you the gist. The film stars Ewan &amp; Scarlet Johansson (aka Black Widow herself) in a utopian society many years in the future. If you’re looking to get your Ewan McGregor fix after Kenobi, I highly recommend watching “The Island” (2005)"

starwars,"I’m not sure why we needed it spelled out to us that Obi Wan considered Darth Vader to be a separate entity to Anakin Skywalker. Even before the prequels came out it was pretty clear that Obi Wan could never reconcile the idea that his friend and the man who betrayed him were the same person, and the prequels further reinforced that. 

Do we ready need Vader to literally come out and say “no, you don’t understand, the Anakin you knew is dead”? It was a cool scene, and I enjoyed it fine, I’m just confused as to why so many of the reactions to it that I’m seeing are variations of “oh, well that clears up this incongruity from ANH.” It just seems like people are uncomfortable with subtext, even when the subtext is pretty blatant.

Anyone else remember this? Hey does anyone else remember when they would show Star Wars on TV(TNT channel I think) in the late 90’s, there would randomly be a guy talking over the top of it?"
starwars,"Okay, we all know that Obi-Wan said the thing, did the pose, the battle had a lot of callbacks, among others.

What I'm surprised by is that I've yet to see people talk about the parallel of Obi-Wan and Leia's final conversation with that of Anakin and Shmi's before he left with Padme's Posse.

Anakin/Leia- ""Will I ever see you again?""

Shmi/Obi-Wan- ""Maybe someday""

Kenobi makes a joke after, but I thought it was cool to see that Leia is clearly her father's daughter beyond what gets pointed out in terms of personality traits. And that Obi-Wan, like Shmi, believes that this child will live a far better life without him. Another parallel I haven't seen pointed out [Kenobi ep6 spoilers]"

starwars,"Yes, I'm an old, cynical asshole who as of right now, is genuinely confused about Revas meaning behind ""I want Justice""

In one corner, I have fans barking at me, because they are saying Reva had no idea about Luke being Vader's son.

In the other corner, they are saying that was the reason she went to Tattooine. She knew the truth. 

Now, the comms she heard said - ""learned of the children,” “Tatooine,” “Owen,” and “help the boy.”

How, just how, does she hear this and think ""Vader has children...""

And how is it justice (revenge) IF VADER HAS NO IDEA HE HAS CHILDREN. 

Have at it. The Reva Contradiction."
starwars,"The last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi connected with me on an extraordinary level that I did not expect.

To give some context, I have been, what I believed to be, happily married to the mother of my son for six years. A few months ago, less than a week before our sixth wedding anniversary, my wife explained to me that she had feelings for another man and was planning on leaving me. I have felt a myriad of painful emotions and have tasted some despair. The woman whom I have loved for the past decade of my life has become someone else. She is self-isolated and refuses to open up to her best friends or family. My best friend, my closest confidant, is gone. I feel like I let my two-year-old son down. I feel like I let my wife down. I feel like less of man. I feel like a failure.

Fast forward a few weeks, and Obi-Wan Kenobi releases its first episode. I immediately identify with Obi-Wan. We see him as a sad, crippled man clearly struggling with emotional, if not psychological, damage from his past. He is clearly broken, and it seems that he has absolutely no hope. He cries out to his Master, and he does not hear from him. I am deeply religious, so I completely understand the feeling of calling out to someone only to hear the deafening silence.

I understand that the show is not perfect and has its flaws, but Ewan’s acting throughout the series has resonated with me on a personal level. In the final episode, we see Obi-Wan struggle with hopelessness and despair, buried deep beneath the rubble with which his best friend, his closest companion, has used to bury him alive. In that moment, Obi-Wan sees flashes of hope, and this hope gives him the strength to rise above the pain and suffering he has experienced. He finds renewed strength to face his former brother. Finally, Obi-Wan faces Anakin and apologizes one more time for everything. A broken and beat Vader then expresses that Anakin Skywalker is dead, and the man, now more of a machine than anything else, is someone completely different. In a way, we see Obi-Wan is now able to finally move on from the grief, despair, and guilt he felt. Recognizing that he could not have done any more for Anakin, he is able to move on into acceptance. 

The last moments of this scene helped me see things somewhat differently in my situation. Could I have done things differently? I believe so. Ultimately, however, people make their own decisions, and sometimes the people we once knew can be gone forever, even if their physical being is standing right before you.

The season ends with what I appropriately believe should be called a new hope for Obi-Wan. Though Padmé’ and Anakin’s story ended in tragedy, like my marriage, there is a restored hope in their children. Likewise, though my son will have to experience the difficulties in growing up in a broken home, I have a new hope that he will rise to the occasion, and something beautiful can still be born out of all the pain, suffering, and mourning that I am currently experiencing.

It may sound cheesy, but this final episode has really helped me cope somewhat with my situation, and I hope it has helped other fans across the globe. God Bless. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Processing Grief, Despair, and Guilt"

starwars,"I have not seen anybody talk about this, so I was wondering when Leia is commanding Obi-Wan around in the hangar:
„Nothing you just reminded me of someone… She was fearless too, and stubborn.“
„I’m not stubborn!“
„Yes you are!“
… „No, she was a leader.“ 
Of course people who didn’t watch clone wars think he is referencing Padme, but I really think they did some sneaky reference to Satine in this moment, I find it more fitting. Also the Padme vibe is strong in episode 3. Satine reference in Kenobi Ep. 2?"
starwars,"Not complaining but i feel like if when he said ""I did"" Vaders voice box came back on for that one line it would've sounded badass and kind of define the difference between Vader and anakin ""You didn't kill anakin Skywalker, I did"""
starwars,"SPOILERS, you've been warned!

Reva as a whole is so undone by the bad writing of this show. She had the potential to be a good character. ""I want Justice"" - Reva"
starwars,"IF you look close on episode 6 directly after Vader traps Obi Wan with the rocks and says ""you are a failure master"" , it switches over to Reva and Owen fighting on that bridge looking structure and during that scene i swear owen goes for a full on crotch grab lmaoo (Chad alert).  Ive played it back a bunch of times to make sure . Did Owen Just Grab Reva's Crotch lol ?"
starwars,"After the finale of OBK, we’re all reassessing how it re-contextualizes the OT. Going in, I think it’s fair to say that just as the paragraph from ANH’s opening scroll served as the basis for Rogue One, Vader’s line, “I sense something, a presence I’ve not felt since…” was the basis for the rematch we just saw. 

I don’t think Vader was referring to Obi-Wan anymore. The presence he felt was Anakin. 

At the end of the duel, Vader makes it clear, Anakin is gone. He killed him. Obi-wan affirms this, story wise, saying “Then my friend is truly dead.”

The next we see, the Emperor senses that Vader may be wavering. Notice how Darth Vader sits up straight almost immediately. Straight to “Kenobi means nothing.” Let’s face it, as much master/apprentice Sidious and Vader’s relationship is, it’s also a bully/victim relationship. Vader knows Sidious can Replace him if he wanted to, so his reaction is really him committing himself to the dark side. In some ways, it’s the closure of the character arcs of Obi wan and Anakin from
The prequel trilogy. Obi-Wan now learning to trust the force like Qui-Gon wanted, Anakin now fully transformed into Darth Vader.

Which brings me to A New Hope. With Luke, leia AND Obi-wan present in the Death Star, it is easy to see that it would stir the force. That Vader would sense all of them. But it would also stir that remnant of Anakin. Ten years later, the Jedi he (Vader) brushed aside for his new master was back. For ten years, Anakin was a ghost in the body of Vader. Vader would’ve suppressed any sense of Anakin left in him. Which is why that sudden stirring in him was a surprise. If this duel in OBK completed the character arc of Anakin to Darth Vader, I would say that this moment was the start of the second arc of Darth Vader to Anakin. 

Also, “when I left you I was but a learner but now I am the master” clearly we see now that that was Vader. Full stop. He’s been the master in control since this duel. I used to think oh how will they work around that but I think it was done very well; by suppressing Anakin, Vader has exerted totally control.

Just some thoughts, what do you think? “A presence I’ve not felt since…”"
starwars,It was just a bad ass scene i wanna use for a wallpaper. Does anyone have a clear high resolution image of Obi lifting those rocks?
starwars,I am still not over the finale. I loved it. The most heart wrenching scene is when vader’s mask breaks and obi wan calls out to his brother his friend “Anakin?” In that moment In that broken mask I could just see little Anakin a brave boy who had to leave his mother. Vader is very powerful but we got to see his human side the side that just wanted to be loved . Obi wan apologising to him broke me. It made all of us cry. The performance from both the actors is top notch. Also the part where obi wan tells Leia about the qualities she has got from her parents is so emotional. Obi wan finale
starwars,"""I am not your failure, Obi-Wan""

To me, these seem like the last words Anakin, not Vader, says to Obi-Wan. That's how I felt it when watching it for the first time, and after re-watching it several times it seems coherent to me.

In the scene, the transition from blue light to red, he's eyes, and his facial expression just before it turns fully maniac suggests to me that those words are from the bit of Anakin that's still in there and that can still come out, and tries to ""free"" Obi-Wan of his burden.

I don't know, that's probably not the intention of the line. Either way I loved the whole duel, it was pretty emotional, and thinking about that line this way made it even more emotional for me.

What do you think of it? Last words to Obi-Wan?"
starwars,"Let me preface this post with saying I thought it was a great series and I feel everyone involved did a phenomenal job. I apologize if this has already been brought up as well. 

In ROTS, when Obi-Wan and Yoda are at the Jedi temple, Obi-Wan reviews the security holograms against Yoda’s advisement. They both see Palpatine standing over Anikan referring to him as Darth Vader. Shortly after that, Yoda tells Obi-Wan that Anikan has been consumed by the dark side and “this Lord Vader”. 

In his 10 years of hiding, did Obi-Wan forget all of this? I understand it was a huge moment in the Kenobi series when Reva tells him who Vader is, but he did know. One small issue with the Kenobi series."
starwars,"I can't seem to find a simple answer to this anywhere - this isn't including just on screen media - but books and comics etc too.

Thanks Is there a definitive list of what media is canon in the post-legends timeline?"
starwars,"He went into permanent exile on Dagobah, and completely gave up.

He owed it to his fellow jedi he failed, and the temple he ran into the ground with his corrupted/skewed view of a jedi's place in society/how jedi should live and act.... to fight to empire to his dying breath.

He, the single most powerful lightside user, did nothing. He just sat around and let thousands of jedi be executed over the years. He could have went on a covert mission to find and gather remaining jedi together to form a jedi army, alongside rebels, to retake the galaxy.
Yoda could defeat Vader in single combat. That would have crippled the Sith hold over the galaxy, leveling the force-user playing field, with Palpatine being the sole threat.

Yoda was a terrible leader who led his people to ruin, then fled and hid with things fell apart because of him.
Not sure if he ever owned up to his mistakes or not.

What do you guys think?

I'm also a part of the community that views all disney crap as non-canon. So no answers from that filth lol... Yoda is the biggest coward in all of StarWars, change my mind."

starwars,Episode 5 ends with Reva taking another lightsaber to the stomach after trying to kill Darth Vader. Episode 6 all of a sudden she’s back on Vader’s side and hunting for Luke.

starwars,"I just finished Obi-Wan today and I thought it was pretty good. The duel between Vader and Obi-Wan was amazing! I had my doubts but I think the show runners did a great job and both Ewan and Hayden gave great performances.

There’s just one plot hole/theory I have that I do want answered. It’s not big but it involves the contrast in Obi-Wan’s appearances.

As we know, the series is set about a decade after Revenge of the Sith and about 9 years before A New Hope. Keeping that in mind, a plot hole for me is Obi-Wan’s appearance. As we all clearly saw there is quite a difference between how old Ewan McGregor looked in the series and how old Alec Guinness looked in A New Hope. My friend and I discussed this and we each came up with a theory.

His theory is that Obi-Wan, at some point, had to use the Force to an extensive degree which caused him age rapidly, similar to Palpatine during his fight against Mace Windu.

My theory, while simpler, is probably less likely: he simply aged terribly due to the stress and devastation of everything that followed Order 66. I actually based this theory on a real life example involving another legendary Star Wars actor: Peter Cushing aka Tarkin. 

Cushing played Abraham Van Helsing in the movie “Dracula A.D. 1972”. A couple years before filming started, Cushing’s wife passed away and it really took a toll on him. He aged so terribly that they switched his role in the movie from being the father of Stephanie Beacham’s character to her grandfather.

If you haven’t seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Also another Star Wars Easter Egg in the film: Count Dracula is played by Christopher Lee aka Count Dooku. There are probably a lot of fans who already know this, but I thought I’d bring it up.

Anyway those are the theories. Do I think an S2 is needed it? Probably not, but if done right, I’d like to see it and see if it answers my question. What do y’all think? Obi-Wan’s Appearance?"

starwars,"I’ve been a big fan of Leia on the Obi Wan show. The child actor has been great and her dynamic with Kenobi has been a joy to watch. I was watching their final scene last night and choking up a bit at the emotion of it all and then I had an invasive thought about the sequels. 

How after what should have been triumph in Return of the Jedi, Leia spends the rest of her life losing everything that has ever mattered to her until she eventually dies alone, having never known peace. It’s so hard for me to invest in these characters knowing that the sequels just inflict trauma after trauma on them. The only happy endings in the sequel trilogies are for the new characters. Everyone we invested in for so long has sad, terrible lives after the OT.

It’s just rough because I love little Leia and want the best for her but I know that the rest of her life is going to be a complete nightmare for the next 50+ years How do you reconcile the sequel canon affecting your enjoyment of stuff that takes place earlier!"
starwars,"Okay, I want to discuss this now that the show is over. We just saw an insanely huge feat of strength from Obi-Wan in that final fight with Vader. I fully expect him to jump up a few spaces and I wanted to hear what the community has to say about it.  


Don't get me wrong, I don't think anyone considered Obi-wan to be weak, per se, however I do think people largely considered him to be weaker than the likes of Rey, Luke, and Yoda. Now, however, I do think there is a point to be made for him to be one of the strongest characters in the current Canon.  


Here are some feats I think are worth considering when discussing.  


* Obi-wan bested Darth Maul on multiple occasions, the first Sith in generations to come out of hiding after defeating Qui-gon, said to be one of the wisest and most force attuned jedi out of anyone in the order at the time. One of my favorite underrated encounters between the two of them was when Maul teamed up with Savage Oppress and still couldn't manage to defeat Kenobi.
* Kenobi bested General Grievous on multiple occasions and was trusted to end the Clone Wars by leading the charge. In episode 3 it was established that the last leader of the Separatists was General Grievous and defeating him would mean an effective end to the Clone Wars. Grievous killed so many Jedi throughout his tenure. Personally, I probably would have sent more than just Kenobi, just in case, but evidently, that would not have been necessary.
* Given these being his two most encountered foes, it would make total sense for him to master form III, Soresu, and eventually become The Master of Soresu. Obi-wan is exceptionally good with a lightsaber in hand and I believe he as been in the most on-screen lightsaber duels. At least, if we're only looking at live action content, that is. Grievous and Maul are two of the most aggressive fighters we see in Canon, so developing a defensive style to outlast them makes a lot of sense and works out very good in power rankings.
* He also wound up to be an exceptional Bounty Hunter counter. In the movies we see him force Jango's retreat as well as Cad Bane's in the Clone Wars. I understand these characters aren't force sensitive, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. Jango Fett specifically was identified by Palpatine to be the perfect genetic sample to create an army of warriors. Fett was also culturally raised by Mandalorians, known for their tools and specialized equipment to best force users. 
* He resisted the Dark Side and becomes a Force Ghost. Not many people have the ability to become Force Ghosts and despite all the pain Obi-wan had to experience, he never let his emotions control him.
* Now, we can say he has beaten Vader twice in his life and even ""lost"" on his own terms. Not many people are able to defeat him, and perhaps part of his success involves some part of Anakin holding back, but I don't think he is holding back all the much in the grand scheme of things. Vader tried to bury Obi-wan alive in the finale, which doesn't strike me as a move by someone who is holding back by much, if at all.   


Ultimately, I would argue that after the last episode he could be considered more powerful than the likes of Yoda, Qui-gon, and Ahsoka. I would even go as far to say rivals or surpassing in power to the likes of Luke and Rey.   


Anyways, I'm interested in hearing what you guys have to say. Obi-wan is my favorite character in all of fiction, so I definitely think I may be a bit biased. Opinions Updated Jedi Power Ratings Post-Kenobi"
starwars,"If Darth Vader can run, why doesn't he?  Or, is he incapable of running now? please settle a debate:"
starwars,Does fight beetween Vader and Obi Wan confirms Obi Wan is stronger than Vader? Or Obi Wan haved big luck? I want to ask about one thing from Obi Wan Episode 6
starwars,"I asked her if she wanted to watch in timeline order or release order and she said “I want to see the whole universe from beginning to end let’s do it that way”. So we just finished AOTC and are moving on to ROTS tomorrow. She’s liked the two she’s seen a lot but I have some questions moving forward from the prequels, because I want to include more than just episodes 1-9. We are definitely watching Rogue one, right before A New Hope if I’m not mistaken. But I want to know what else I should add? Here’s where my question begins…

First 

Should we watch Obi Wan and if so when. I haven’t seen the show. I know it takes place before the original trilogy so keep in mind she will see this show before the original trilogy if I include it. I only really want to watch if it’ll enhance the story of the whole Star Wars universe for her you know? So will it do that?

Second

I’d like to watch Solo and the Mandalorian also, and I’m not sure where to place them (I want to go in timeline order). Also should I have her watch them? Forget about length I’m just thinking about if they’d add to the story or not. I feel solo would but the mandalorian is definitely more of a departure. Though I love that show. My Girlfriend finally wants to watch Star Wars with me, HELP!!!"
starwars,"Its alright.

5th episode was delightful, the finale was decent but mostly everything prior to that was underwhelming or lacklustre. 

The narrative wasn’t great. 
The majority of the show was just:
Save child from room while Reva throws a temper tantrum. 

I wish they had a larger assortment of competent writers because the standards between episodes was distinctly inconsistent. 

I also wish they featured more of Hayden, especially because of how much they used him for promoting the show and yet he had very scarce appearances throughout.

As a show it doesn’t contribute much to the canon but regardless it still is worth the watch.

I guess I am a little disappointed to some extent because I expected a lot more. But hey, it could be worse; this is Disney we are talking about. By their standards this show is a work of art. Kenobi: The final verdict"
starwars,"I don’t think many people fully appreciate what a coup Obi-Wan was. Most the professional reviewers seem to have adopted the concept of “yeah was ‘aight”.

No, this was a masterful continuation of the saga. In many ways it retconned the flaws of Episodes 1-3 and brought closure between Vader and Obi-Wan that wasn’t fully achieved in Episode 4. Yes, I understand that they rehashed some themes, but it was not overdone. This is the way you merge nostalgia with modern story telling. Prove me wrong. Obi-Wan has Transformed Disney’s Star Wars"
starwars,"I just don't understand why Reva wanted to kill Luke, after she learned about him in the message. Can someone explain Reva's motivation?"
starwars,"During the scene in episode 6 of Kenobi where Luke and Owen enter a shop to get parts the shopkeeper knows Owen is Luke’s uncles not father. This makes no sense to me, the only sibling we are aware Owen has was Anakin so if Luke is Owens nephew he had to be Anakin kids. If no one knowing that was so important for Luke’s safety why would Owen screw up like that other that terrible writing. Why would Owen let people on Tatooine know he is Luke’s uncle not father"
starwars,"I wanna start this off by saying I don’t want this to sound like a baseless rant, there are SO many amazing scenes in this show and I absolutely love some of the new ideas it brings to the table. For the most part, Obi-Wan has delivered on more than I ever expected.

But man, it is really hard to focus on some of these amazing scenes when the camera is shaking like there’s a constant earthquake. Shaky-cam is a good technique to show disorientation or can give a “first-person” perspective like you’re running alongside the action. It’s fantastic when used sparingly. 

But then there are scenes where characters are just…talking? Like when Obi Wan is talking to the other Jedi in the desert, the camera just won’t stand still. There are action scenes where you can’t see what’s going on not because the action is fast paced or disorienting, but because that stupid camera won’t focus. Order 66 begins with this really nice stable pan-in shot, but in that same shot the camera then decides to have a fit the second Clones enter the scene in the background. It’s almost nauseating.

Part of what made Star Wars’ action and character moments so engaging and classic is that the camera was always focused on what was happening. There was never a moment in a space battle, lightsaber fight, shootout, or a dialogue session that needed to constantly shake the camera to get the point across. The newer movies use this technique sure, but it’s again *used sparingly*. It works because the scenes in question call for it. But last night in one of the most important character moments of not only the series, but the entire **franchise**, where Obi Wan speaks to an unmasked Vader for the first time with a ton of emotion, buildup, and character development backing it up…

The camera *will not. Stop. Shaking.*

I want to focus on what is pretty much the entire reason this show exists, the character interaction between Obi-Wan and Vader, and it feels like the show is trying to actively distract me from it. I can’t focus on the emotions the show wants me to feel because even when characters are standing perfectly still, the camera is still being shot like we’re in a warzone. Was it that much of a distraction to anyone else? Everyone I’ve talked to in person seems to agree, but I’d like some more opinions because I really feel like an asshole for thinking that. Thanks a ton for reading my long essay lol. As much as I love this show, I think the constant shaky camera movement really kills a lot of emotional scenes"
starwars,Darth Vader has many years of training and Obi Wan had trouble with the force and “randomly” regained his strength and basically “easily” won the fight. Is there a reason to it? How was Obi Wan able to defeat Darth Vader in ep 6?
starwars,I’d much prefer that we go a series about Rahm Kota (from force unleashed). What are your thoughts? Serious question - Did we really need the Obi Wan Kenobi series?
starwars,"How have your opinions changed? Has it gotten better or worse? Why?

Let’s keep it civil! I feel most, if not all, of us can agree that the final duel was behind amazing, but the show definitely had some divisive moments! What we’re your favorites and least favorites?

Need an S2? 

—————————————
I think Episode VI was a perfect end to this story. I personally don’t think an S2 is needed, however, if there is one, it needs to not have Leia in it. I think his interactions with her are done. Luke, yea, since they live on the same planet but Luke shouldn’t be a focus. I would want it to focus on Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Vader can be in it, too, but with the way this season ended, Them running into each other again and again would be the same -possibly- I’m not versed in the EU or comics. 

I feel that Reva doesn’t need her own show, so her story could/should end with S2 with her death or something. I do like how her arc ended this season and wouldn’t mind seeing where she goes from there. 

More Owen and Beru would be great. Badass Uncle and Aunt action was fun and fantastic. Could always use more.

All in all. GREAT finale. Emotional and epic.

Thank you, Star Wars!!! *SPOILERS* Now that Kenobi is done, what are y’all’s thoughts?"
starwars,"In Clone Wars iirc, Yoda is guided by the voice of Qui Gon to learn how to show himself in the force after his death. Qui Gon apparently cannot show himself, but will teach Yoda. So how is it possible that Qui Gon can show himself with the force in e6? Question on Kenobi e6"
starwars,"Yea he won the first round kind of but he didn’t really do that much damage to him, and he’s much more powerful in the force than Kenobi is. You think he secretly didn’t want to actually kill Kenobi or what? The fight was great, just felt Vader shouldn’t stabbed him or done some more damage. What do you all think? Anybody thing Vader should’ve damaged Kenobi more? Kenobi Episode 6 finale"
starwars,I have spoken. Speculation: Either Haja Estree or Roken (or both) from Obi Wan Kenobi will be in the Andor series.
starwars,"The clone wars were mentioned in Star Wars 1977. Clearly this was before the prequels, but have you wondered what George’s original ideas were? Do you ever wonder what the idea of the clone wars was before the prequel trilogy?"
starwars,"My wife have never watched star wars. She has this feeling that it is just a ""boring space movie"". But she agreed to watch a star wars film with me and give it a chance.

What movie/show could be a good first approach? Best movie / tv show as FIRST APPROACH to Star Wars?"
starwars,"Ewan is great. Hayden is great. Lots of emotion. Good stuff.

But....


1. Reva is stabbed and left for dead by Darth. Next episode with no discernable passage of time she has warped to tatooine and is basically fine aside from some heavy breathing. Combined with the grand I also being stabbed and left for dead makes me wonder if the lightsabers have a stun setting?/s. But seriously there was no explanation. I feel.like Darth doesn't leave survivors so casually.
2. Having had 2 life or death battles there is no reasoning for obi wan not killing Darth, especially after he admits he friend is truly dead. 
3. Revas motivation is inscrutable. She is one of the main characters. She tried to kill Darth and fails. Then She doesn't want to turn into Darth so she goes to try to kill youngling luke? On whose behalf? Why? I like the main plot of OWK but I have issues. anyone else? (SPOILERS ALL)"
starwars,"As far as I know, there are three variants, first is phase l, which is from the original clone wars cartoon from the early 2000s, it featured the same helmet as other phase 1 clones, then there’s phase 1.5,  which was allegedly a prototype version of the phase 2 armor, featuring a mix of phase l &amp; ll’s helmets, it can be seen in clone wars before the transition to phase ll, Echo Fives, Colt, Blitz, Hammer and Havoc use this armor, and finally there’s phase ll, which has the same helmet as phase ll clones, Fives and Jesse are the only clones that come to mind who used it, but there’s probably more, personally I really like the phase 1.5 variant as I find the mixture of both helmets to look really neat Which ARC Trooper armor phase is your favorite?"
starwars,"Instead of darth Vader being in his castle talking to the emperor. I wish it was actually at the Death Star, than it cuts to darth Vader going into his meditation chamber and taking his helmet off and hearing the raspy voice of Hayden saying “ I’m doing this for you, my love…Padme” and you hear the echoing voice of padme saying “I love you” and shows darth Vader shedding a tear while playing anakin betrayal from ROTS which fades into the imperial March while vaders meditation capsule closes. Idk I think that would be rad What I wanted to see in the finale of kenobi"
starwars,"Not that this would ever happen because Disney usually doesn’t give filmmakers any creative freedom, but personally I would love to see Denis Villeneuve or Robert Eggers make a Star Wars movie. Who would you choose? What director would you like to see make a Star Wars movie with complete creative control?"
starwars,"Hayden Christensen did an absolutely amazing job.

Damn that fucking evil and creepy grin when he speaks to Obi-Wan is low-key Oscar-worthy performance. Dude looked fucking insane. You already did not want to be in the same room as Vader before this scene, now you just want to be as far away as possible from that freak. Just take this scene and show it to someone who does not know Star Wars at all and they'd say it's a horror movie.

The whole scene is acted so well both by Hayden and Ewan. But fuck Hayden stole the entire fucking show in this scene, I mean it. Just the way he delivers the dialogue, the way he looks at Obi-Wan, the way you can tell there was a tiny glimpse of Anakin when he says ""I am not your failure, Obi-Wan"" and then Vader jumps right back in the suit... and again this fucking evil creepy grin. Crazy performance. I feel like not even some of the best actors out there could have pulled it so well.

That was some gold acting right there. I never thought that Hayden Christensen was a bad actor, not at all. But fuck this was insane-level acting right there. Absolutely nailed it. ""I did."""
starwars,I’m sorry but nothing in the show makes goddamn sense. I mean it’s hilarious don’t get me wrong. But there is no way that this is part of the original trilogy no way. There is no way the Obi Wan show is canon. No way.
starwars,"Does anyone else really like The Rise of Skywalker? It is my third favorite Star Wars film, behind Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One. I don’t agree with the return of Palpatine, but I love everything else in the film. Episode IX"
starwars,"Well. Title says it all. I'd like to hear your opinions. I don't care about spoilers so feel free to just coment whatever you feel like.  I wanted to wait until all episodes were out to watch it. but now I don't know.

I have heard that:
It's not that good, kinda like BOBF.
It's a bait and switch, where it is not really focusing on obi wan.

Also there's all the political Twitter bullshit around it. Is Obi Wan's series good, bad, mediocre?"
starwars,Thats exactly what I wanted!!!!!! “We just weren’t ready to see him yet!” Omg I peed alittle!
starwars,"When I first heard this show was actually in production and going to be on its way soon, I'll be honest: I didn't have high hopes. I didn't think it would flop, mind you. I just thought it was unnecessary for the most part. Yes, we all love Obi-Wan and Ewan McGregor. But to bring him back just for one show completely about his own character, I just didn't think it was needed and thought Disney was just doing it for the money (and for the fanservice, for us at least). 

And the first episode didn't really change my view that much. I didn't think it was bad. I actually thought it was pretty good and that Ewan really did a great job. The cinematography was also really good (Disney is definitely getting their money's worth with the Mos Eisley set). And I resolved myself to see this series through and just see where they were going with it. And I'm kind of glad I did. It was nice seeing a broken man like Obi finally find a reason to keep going and put his past behind him for good. 

The one major complaint I have about the series though is Reva. So she was a Jedi youngling that survived being gutted by Darth Vader. And she became Grand Inquisitor to get close enough to him to try and kill him, but she failed. So instead of just packing up and going home, she decides to try and kill Luke. For...what reason again? ""Justice""? By killing Luke, a defenseless child, she is exacting justice...how exactly? I don't know. Maybe her plot flew over my head, but she just seemed like an unnecessary villain in this story. It's hard enough dealing with one vengeful Sith let alone two. 

Overall, I'm glad I stuck with the show. I still think Mandalorian is better in terms of the screenwriting and overall plot, but this one is an honorable second. I look forward to seeing where the writers decide to go with Obi-Wan since we've got a lot of years between now and New Hope, canonically speaking. [Spoilers] My thoughts on the Obi-Wan Kenobi finale and the show as a whole"
starwars,"Hello there! I just finished the last episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it was amazing. I'm trying to keep this post spoilers free.

So, I think that the series is generally good. The first three episodes felt slow, but the other half went really well in my opinion. I think that it's not bad as a six part series, but in my opinion the series would have worked better as a movie.

There was way too much filler in a couple of episodes to fully keep my focus and interest in it. I love when something happened, but during the first half there just didn't. I was way too judgemental on several things, such as Reva's character. She got an amazing character development, even though I think it was a bit too late. I kinda hope we would see her again in some form.

I think that there was an attempt to make it like Clone Wars, especially on Reva's character, but it kinda failed at that. In my opinion that is mostly because the show was only six episodes long, so we didn't really get a grip on this new character. I do enjoy though that the episodes kinda mirrored the events of episodes I-VI. As mr. Lucas would say, it ""rhymed"".

Kenobi series would've been better as a movie, but it was an overall enjoyable experience. The last two episodes are very rewatchable, but the start was way too slow. Solid 8/10, even though it was carried by the second half. Good job Evan, Hayden, and all the others that were a part of this series. Obi-Wan Kenobi final thoughts"
starwars,I remember at the end of rogue one there was a boy that uses the force to grab a broom. Did Star Wars do anything with that boy? I haven’t seen anything about him and it seemed like something important. Teasing a new jedi?
starwars,"Spoilers !!!

&amp;#x200B;

The moment when Obi Wan was buried by the rocks by Vader was such a great and powerful scene and realization of why Obi Wan is the perfect jedi !! My wife looked at me after and told me how great it was that while lots of other characters get their motivation and power from anger or revenge, what makes Obi Wan so special is that right before he breaks free and kicks Vaders ass he pictures all his failures... and then sees Lei. This is such a good moment because it showcases that Obi Wan gets his power and motivation from protecting others. From being wholesome and good. And it almost seems like the force rewarded him for truly being so noble and good ! 

Just thought this was interesting ! sorry if its been mentioned somewhere before Awesome realization my wife told me about a scene in Kenobi !"
starwars,"For me, it's the fact that the Empire's official story on Anakin Skywalker was that he died defending the younglings during Order 66. What's your favorite detail and piece of backstory from the Star Wars universe?"
starwars,"* Obi-Wan fights defensively but in this fight he was the aggressor
* He went in with the idea to kill Vader
* He reflected on Leia and the emotional affect she had on him to save himself Did Obi-Wan use the darkside of the force to beat Vader?"
starwars,"I was trying to figure out why the red vs blue saber duels looked so different in Obi Wan, and I think it's because for the first time they managed to have light cast off the lightsabers, onto the actors/performers. So Obi Wan was cast in a blue light, while Vader was cast in a red light.

starwars,What is the In-universe explanation because of course Cad bane Didn't exist back then Why wasn't Cad Bane hired by the Empire in Episode V?
starwars,"Upvote this to let Disney know we want an entire series for order 66. Different story’s for each episode, one from Anakins perspective, etc. I’m not sure about anyone else, but I NEED a series based around order 66 and how detrimental it was for the entire galaxy. Order 66"

starwars,"We only see it in ANH, it looks awesome, it sets itself apart from the other TIE fighters, how come we never see it again? In the Kenobi show, he doesn’t even use it. 

It’s cool that Vader is perceived as the Superior, but I felt as though having his own TIE fighter gives him somewhat a feel as though he is still a fighter, he is fighting for the same cause as the Storm Troopers.

I don’t know, just thought I should point it out, what are you’re guys’ thoughts on Vader’s TIE fighter? Vader’s TIE Fighter"
starwars,"There is a lot of Love for one of the most iconic villains in movie history. But I just can’t see ‘the evil’ everyone is talking about.

Maybe it’s the mask shielding facial expressions. When I see Anakin slaughter everyone just after he pledges to Sidious and before he gets ‘suited up’, then I do see evil and rage and danger and fright and scare… But as soon as he’s in the suit and James Earl Jones voices him, I can’t really believe it is ‘Anakin’, despite knowing he used to be Anakin. Even the impressive force tricks he pulled off in The Kenobi show doesn’t convince me.

The only moment Darth Vader comes close to being convincing is in A New Hope when he says “Commander tear this ship apart and find me the passengers, I want them Alive!”. I guess that’s because It’s the only time we hear him talk with a raised angry voice. 

Anakin had way more passion in his speech, he was way more determined and demanding and snarky and witty.

Vader is proper, almost calm with a complete different vocabulary.

Anakin was scary, Vader is just an established asshole. Darth Vader is unconvincing."
starwars,"Jimmy as Bail Organa is easily one of the best/ most under appreciated parts of the show.

I'm 22 now and I hope i get to live to 100, not because I want to see my great grandkids or observe how much humanity progresses over that time, but because hopefully by then there will be a way to liquefy the finale of KENOBI so I can inject it into my veins"

I don't think Disney really know what they want to do with starwars, we've gotten some great moments but it's been like eating little bits of candy from a pile of shit most of the time with the films and series they've done apart from the Mando show (The Animated shows have been great) I just hope they find some good consistency and for god sakes! Use more of the John Williams music we love! It adds another level to the emotional moments.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't understand this line from A New Hope.  so I assume they will fight again in Season 2 or perhaps later. 

if I were to be making sense of that one line from ANH -   I would have change the Kenobi scene around just a Tad.

&amp;#x200B;

instead of Kenobi just walking away, calling him Darth -  

that moment, is when Kenobi should have sensed Luke being in danger, and Reva hunting him and the Larrs family. 

have Darth Vader sense this.... feeling while being on his knees , defeated - that should have been the Tremor in the force.

&amp;#x200B;

because without Luke,   Anakin wouldn't have been redeemed the ""Tremor in the force"" that Darth Vader feels..."
starwars,"It took 6 episodes for the Imperial March, Force theme and Leia’s theme to play…in a show about Vader, Jedi and Leia.

My biggest gripe is how underwhelming the soundtrack has been. I did not like 5 episodes of generic sci-fi action music. What happened to the music in Kenobi?"
starwars,"After she put down Luke she should have died from her injuries. 

Not only would this not leave the awkward question situation if her just being around, but it would have been very impactful. How?

Well first of all, it doesn't make sense that she survives. She has a hole in her stomach, and seemingly the only reason she can keep going is her hatred and need for revenge. But after she has let Luke live she doesn't have that, she has let her rage and need for revenge go. But someone she is still keeping herself alive? 

Second of all. Having her die her because of not being able to keep herself alive anymore means that she made the concous choice of not killing this kid, of not going down the dark path knowing full well that it was the only way she could continue to fuel her anger and dark side and continue living.

So it not only would have made more sense and not leave a plot hole, but it also could have been a say more meaningful and touching end to her arc if she had died after saving Luke. This is how Reva's story should have ended:"
starwars,"Listing a few things out that bother me and others who want the writers and directors to put more effort into these series, movies, etc.

- Reva’s arc was incredibly predictable and disconnected by the episodic format
- GI is underused and could’ve easily been the main villain instead of Reva
- The show essentially copied rebels Vader/ Ahsoka fight with the fight with Vader in OWK
- Some stupid decisions like following Kenobis tiny drop ship with the entire star destroyer instead of launching fighters…
- Copying fallen order with the entire Fortress Inquisitiorious
- Leia being a plot device when the story could’ve easily focused exclusively on Kenobi/Qui-gon/Vader
- some of the CGI could’ve been better

There are many good elements such as Qui-gon, Vader fights, flashback, Obi-wan himself,etc.

Listen… I am not at all bashing any actors.. and even thinking about this along the lines of critiquing the writing/director is not accurate.

I am a StarWars fan and I want Dave/Jon to lead every series because it’s obvious that other directors/writers seem to not “get” it and squeeze characters/worlds/etc. when it doesn’t have to be. The writing and directing in Obi-Wan is a hit or miss."
starwars,"Now, before I get into what the title of this post says, I just want to say that I enjoy the prequels. Sure, the dialogue and acting may be a little clunky at times, and the overabundance of CGI can be distracting. But overall, I thought that the prequels did a good job at fleshing out the Star Wars universe with the introduction of new worlds like Coruscant, Mustafar, and Kamino. I have also come to appreciate Hayden Christensen’s portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, and I especially love how he portrayed Darth Vader throughout the first season of Kenobi! 

Anyway, one issue that I have with the prequels is the inclusion of the Chosen One prophecy, and what it means for the story of Star Wars. My problem with it’s inclusion is that it kind of makes the Star Wars universe feel smaller than it should be. Since it states that Anakin Skywalker is supposed to bring balance to the Force, I feel that it puts him and his bloodline on a pedestal (which I understand was George Lucas’s intention with the Skywalker saga), and makes the story feel less inclusive for other characters.

One of the things I love about Rogue One, Solo, The Mandalorian, and the upcoming Disney Plus shows is that they give other characters time to breathe and make the Star Wars universe feel bigger and richer.

Now, this isn’t to say that I’m against telling the story of Anakin Skywalker. I just feel that Lucas could’ve done it in a way that doesn’t overstate his/Vader’s importance in the grand scheme of things. An issue that I have with the Chosen One prophecy."
starwars,"How aware were the people of the galaxy of the Sith? They were historically enemies of the republic, and the empire is technically a restructuring of the same republic.  We know Palpatine didn’t really reveal himself publicly as a Sith during the OT so I guess maybe he knew there would be some backlash. However Darth Vader was publicly a “Darth” which is a Sith naming convention. Is there canon information about this, or what are your opinions? I’m just generally interested in how common people viewed these religious structures from the outside. How aware were the people of the galaxy of the sith?"

starwars,"So, a lot of people are divided on Kenobi’s anime friendship power-up against Vader. After seeing Kenobi almost unable to use his powers, we’re now seeing him stronger than ever before because of a few flashbacks; and a lot of people don’t like it and feel like it is an unearned boost that messes with the power scaling. 

Well, I’m here to tell you that you’re wrong. Not wrong in how you feel about it, that’s your opinion, but you’re wrong about it being unearned, and is actually a major plot point in the entirety of the Star Wars universe. 

Jedi are taught to suppress their emotions, and Kenobi took this very seriously. Even though his Master Qui Gonn pushed him to express himself and be mindful, Kenobi stuck by the Jedi’s teachings to the letter. The battle against Maul on Naboo saw Kenobi lose Qui-Gonn, before he himself defeated him. Afterwards, Kenobi dedicated his lightsaber training to defensive combat in response to Qui-Gonn’s defeat, which further emphasised the need for a calm mind which suppressed his emotions. 

We saw how cautious this made Kenobi when fighting Count Dooku, and how it made him a very unemotional teacher to Anakin, who was being taught to ignore his emotions and even the dreams of his mother’s death, which could have been prevented if Obi had more aware of Anakin’s feelings, but he was always scared that Anakin’s emotions and recklessness would get him killed. 

After Order 66, Kenobi stopped practicing the Jedi code, and lost touch with the force. In this time, he mourned his padawan, as well as all the Jedi that had died, and for the first time in his life he was left alone with his emotions and he truly suppressed them, ran away haunted by the past, and he lost touch with the force.

When Leia fell from the rooftop, it was his emotions that used the force to save her, and that’s what he’s realising as he’s buried under the rocks. He let go of suppressing his emotions and let them fuel him, which is why his lightsaber style immediately changes to aggressive and confident. Kenobi has been stifling himself for his whole life since Qui-Gonn’s death, but he realised he was right, and the Jedi were wrong. 

So, whilst it may seem like bullshit, Kenobi had just finished a character development arc that started in The Phantom Menace Let’s talk about a contentious Kenobi issue… (spoilers for Episode 6)"
starwars,That alarm thingy that gives Obi Wan the green light if his crib is safe to enter looks just like R2’s thing that he can eject from his head. When I watched it I completely forgot that R2 is at casa de Morgana and I actually thought Obi Wan had dug down poor R2 in the sand 😅 I tried posting this with the picture but it got deleted. It’s in episode 1 and maybe 2 I can’t remember. R2 home alarm system for Obi Wan.
starwars,"I watched last night and wasn't really sure what Obi-Wan was doing at the end?   


Right before he finally got to meet Luke, he was saying to Owen ""you're in charge now"" which in the context made it sound like Ben did what he needed to do and it's time for him to move on?  Or is he retreating further into the desert to be close by but no longer ""in charge"" of Luke's protection?  Obviously the cameo at the end implies that he's far from being inactive/hermit (and also implied we coulda had such a better series, let's be real), so I was kinda left befuddled at what's going on.  


I was always under the impression that he was still protecting Luke in Episode IV, but I guess thinking about it, he was just close by. Could someone explain the ending of Obi-Wan for me?"
starwars,"I grew up with the Original Trilogy, wore my bootleg VHS copies out as a kid.  Even back then my friends and I all knew Vader ended up in the suit because he was badly burned by lava in a light Saber duel with Obi-Wan.  How though?  What was the original source for this?  It's never stated in the movies but I can remember even way back then that it was a basic Star Wars fact. For those of us who grew up with the Original Trilogy, what was the original source for how Vader ended up in the suit? How did we know?"
starwars,With what has been accomplished with the shows on Disney+ do you think that if the sequel trilogy was made today that the project would be handed over to Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau? A lot of work from these two have went into to fixing the holes in the sequel trilogy. To me the idea of having a sequel trilogy by them instead of what we got would’ve  not only made the universe stronger but would’ve possibly been given the shows a stronger foundation to work from. Sequel trilogy what if
starwars,"Like, seriously, it's one of the best shows I've seen in a long time, and the finale was awesome. Then I googled ""season 2"" , and was like, ""Seriously, this again?"" I mean we have shows like Dancing with the Stars that won't go away, The Simpsons, which is just stale at this point, but great shows like this get a limited run? Put Hawkeye on my list of shows I want more of. And Winter Soldier. And a LOT of others. There are a few that make it past season 1, but then they get canceled long before I think they should. Stranger Things, I'm talking to YOU. Is anyone else getting a little tired of limited-run series for great shows like Obi-Wan?"
starwars,"So he lived to be around 900, and says he trained jedi for 800 years. We know his race stays an infant for well over 50 years. So what was he, like 100 when he started to train jedi? Given how his people age that would make him super young for the job Was Yoda a child prodogie?"
starwars,"Can we talk about how bad the choreography has gotten since Book of Boba Fett? Between the space-vespa chase scene, both of Leia’s chase scenes in Kenobi, and a certain scene where Tala completely disarms a stormtrooper with a slap to the helmet, I seriously believe that the choreography team has either been significantly reduced or entirely let go. I understand that these shows probably have a lower budget than the movies but if Star Wars is going in the direction of shows instead of movies at least make me feel like I’m watching a professionally made show instead of the Power Rangers. Choreography in the new shows"
starwars,Why does the droid general fella at the start of episode 3 have a smokers cough? Droid with a smokers cough
starwars,"Was just re-watching this scene:  [Star Wars: A New Hope l ""That's No Moon"" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FM5bksrImg)   


and I noticed something. As soon as the ship appears to be caught in a tractor beam, Obi-Wan engages a look of intense concentration. I'm not trying to say that there was no tractor beam, but based on what we know from the recent series, would it be fair to say that Obi-Wan used the force to prevent the ship from breaking free from the pull of the tractor beam?   


My line of thinking is essentially based on OWK Episode 6, where Obi-Wan channels some sort-of 'dark side' energy through his attachment to Leia, allowing him to beat Vader. Could it be he had a similar feeling when observing the Death Star, sensing that both Leia and Vader were on board, and also knowing that Leia had requested his help specifically, and now was the perfect time for him to transcend his life energy into the force. But also appreciating the idea that for everyone else on board, the idea of just boarding the Death Star was certain death, so rather than suggest it, Obi-Wan used the will of the force to make it happen?

I just thought it was really cool, noticing the change of expression on Alec Guiness' face to an intense concentration as soon as Han tries to break the ship free from the tractor beam.

Anyway, I think it fits, let me know what you guys think. Would be cool to hear if people think that's complete nonsense too lmao. Did Obi-Wan use the force to push the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star in A New Hope? [Obi-Wan Kenobi Spoilers]"
starwars,"When Vader told Kenobi “You didn’t kill Anakin Skywalker…I did”, do you think it was a moment of genuine self reflection or Vader denying him “credit” in a petty way? Some people have suggested the latter since Vader had a smirk on his face when he said it. Personally I can’t decide either way. 

It certainly had the effect of absolving Kenobi of his guilt, whether this was intended by Vader or not. The Ambiguity of this Line"
starwars,"Seriously, people. Why are there so many people hating on each other in r/StarWars. It's so unnecessary. It's a subreddit were people that love Star Wars can come together and simply love Star Wars and it's content. I don't get it. Serious Question: Why are there so many malicious members in this subreddit?"
starwars,"It wasn't needed. 


If they were going to do this meeting anyway, they should have made it more like when Obi-Wan met Anakin for the first [time]( https://youtu.be/5_rT0gNbqoI). Sorry for the extra part of the video. 

Just a simple introduction from Lars. ""Luke Skywalker, meet Ben Kenobi."" ""Hello there"""
starwars,"I just think it’s so stupid how he let him live, knowing how last time he left him for dead while he was on fire and he survived that. Why did Obi-wan spare Darth Vader...again?"
starwars,"I personally loved the last episode of Kenobi. But something that I’ve seen in peoples reactions and discussions about the episode had me think about a deeper significance of this duel that some people on the internet have probably talked about but I wanted to make my own post to talk about it because it seems really cool to me!

Even with all the power Vader has, and the fact that Obi-Wan regained his powers not that recently after being a full on hermit what seemed like only a week or so before his duel I think it’s interesting to think of the psychological aspect of the duel. Anakin of course lost to Obi-Wan on Mustafar and has been thinking of his loss for years, planning his next fight with his master. And I think the show did a great job of showing the human nerves inside of anakin. He uses one hand for the first moments of the duel in episode 6 but quickly switches to 2, hands and to me, despite being in a suit, almost looks nervous or not as foreboding as Vader typically does. He seems more focused (which ofc he is he has been waiting for this moment) but idk something about it seems like nerves to me. He is certainly powerful in this fight and even beats obi initially, but when he was losing towards the end, all I could see was a desperate anakin trying to not lose again, making those larger swings one does in desperation. And I think that shows even more sides to the young man in Vader’s suit.

To Vader, Obi is that one person that he just can’t beat no matter how good he gets. And the fact obiwan was his master and older than him no doubt adds to it. It’s all mental. Like in sports teams there are matchups where no matter how good one team is, there is a history between the two that just seems to make everyone know the “better” team will lose anyway. Possibly because of the nerves from previous losses.  I think the show, even if unintended and I’m just being over-analytical did a great job with the duel! What are your guys’ thoughts on the duel? Vader and Obi-Wan psychology"
starwars,"Short answer: I’m 100% fine without a second season. Kenobi ended masterfully and sets up for ANH. 

However, I’m a Star Wars geek. If we get a season 2 I’m going to eat it up just like a lot of other fans. My biggest worry would be the story. What would have to happen in order for Kenobi to leave Tatooine again? Would it be a necessary story to tell? What work-arounds would be implemented to stay true to canon (example: Luke not seeing Reva’s lightsaber in the finale). A story for S2 would be very difficult to construct. What are your thoughts on a S2 of Kenobi?"
starwars,"Why did that inquisitor, or former inquisitor, want to kill Luke? What I mean is, what was her motivation to kill him? 

It was revealed in episode 5 she wasn't ""bad"" per se, and was actually trying to get revenge on Vader and kill him the whole time. Surely she couldn't be doing it to get back into Vader or the Grand Insqusitor's good graces, they would probably kill her on sight if they saw her again. Plus, she hates them. It was not explained at all, unless I missed it, why she wanted to find and kill Luke? Question about Obi Wan finale"
starwars,"soo the holocron is the same one Cad Bane stole (clone wars) that was Jocasta Nu's and the only copy. Then it got destroyed by vader (2017 comic)after her death, but then it shows up a few years later in Eno Cordova's( jedi fallen order) hands and i think its a different color too, but Jocasta Nu considers erasing it because its the only list of force sensitives so there shouldn't be another copy for Cal Kestis to find... can someone please explain this to me within the canon? The holocron with the list of force sensative children"
starwars,"A lot of really cool nuggets here. Some have been grabbed from Legends and are made canon and some we haven’t heard of before. There are also carvings of phrases the Jedi use, such as “When your are eyes closed, then you can truly see.”

starwars,"I was recently given truck decal stickers of these two logos. Trying to decide which one to put on my vehicle. The skull is iconic, but overused to an extent. The helmet might be a nice alternative, just unsure. Figured I would ask for opinions on this sub! Mando helmet or Mythosaur skull?"
starwars,"One of my only major complaints about the show is the camera shake technique used throughout the entire length of the series. Incredible action sequences are undercut by the dizzying cinematography, and moments of dramatic tension are muddled and confused by excessive movements of the camera. All in all, the technique was, to me, incredibly distracting. I cannot understand why the choice to use camera shake was made, and unlike other similar cinematographic  ""mishaps"" like JJ Abrams' incessant  use of lens flare, I had a hard time overlooking it. Am I going crazy? Obi-Wan Kenobi's obsession with camera shake"
starwars,"If there was, he'd do anything to claim the title of ""Chosen One"" and expose Anakin &amp; Padme's romance to Obi-Wan &amp; the council.

How do you picture that? What if there had been a Jedi in Episode 3, who finds out about Anakin's affair with Padme?"
starwars,Mine would be crossing paths with someone like darth maul or starkiller. And losing. What’s yours? What do you propose as a cool ending to the story of Cal Kestis?
starwars,"Her acting was above what I was expecting from a 10-year-old. (Going off of other movies and knowing 10-year-olds) She stole the show in every scene that she had. My young daughter was infatuated and pulled into the world of Star Wars, watching a little kid like her be confident, daring, and adventurous in a world of big foreign creatures and adults.

For me, her small facial movements, body language, and delivery really blew me away.
The blend of old ben and nostalgia, mixed with new young Leia made it really easy to overlook silly plot and story elements. Id love to see a live action adventures of Leia and enjoy it with my family. Not one that panders to just the youngest of crowds with over the top sillyness but enjoyable by all starwars groups.

We will watch her career with great interest Young Leia actress (Vivien Lyra Blair) did a phenomenal job. My family and I hope to see her as Leia again."
starwars,"If Vader wanted to capture Kenobi at all costs, why did he let him get rescued by a droid? Why did vader let kenobi go?"
starwars,"I have been a star wars fan for as long as I can remember. Grew up with the prequels, adored the originals and honestly? Enjoyed the sequels. And I know people had their gripes with it in the middle.. but this show made me feel like a kid again. I got lost in the magic, so thank you Obi Wan Kenobi.

It was a tragic story of life after war, rediscovering who they were before after a tragic loss of a war and a best friend/brother. I went in with with-held expectations. Genuinely didn't expect to see Vader as much as we saw Vader. I didn't expect to see Obi-Wan and Vader go face to face so early, I wasn't expecting the very good young leia. I loved Revas background (a young jedi infiltrating the ranks of the empire just to avenge her friends, she felt as if she NEEDED to give justice) which was a very nice touch and gave a lot of depth to that. 

I LOVED Vader here. Honestly, At the end of the day? I'm glad the Imperial March didn't play until the last 10 minutes. It shows Vader was allowed off his leash for a while; until he lost against Kenobi again which left palpatine keeping him close and stopping him going wild because he can't afford to lose him.

I LOVED the parallels to stuff, and yes. I agree, it wasn't a perfect show. But what is ‘perfect’, for me, a fan of this series for 20+ years, felt absolutely satisfied with it and I will always remember watching Obi Wan Kenobi. The show wasn't perfect for everyone, but for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 

There was obviously gripes I had with it, nothing is 'perfect', majorly coming from music, the trailer had great music! And the show didn't include it, which isn't bad, I loved the music for the show but I feel like I was edged with that trailer and we lacked it in the show! I assume there was a reason though?

But this show let me rediscover what I love most about Star Wars.. I got lost in the magic of the galaxy far far away. I felt like a kid watching star wars again, I got lost in the magic. My imagination ran wild. Kenobi let me rediscover what I love about star wars and it's the fact you don't need to go through everything with a fine tooth comb, some thing can be dumb, something can be silly and you just let your imagination run wild as to WHY this happened and how they got away with it. I just loved Kenobi top to bottom. It's okay if you didn't, but I couldn't had been more happier with it... Plus, it had episode 2 obi wan and my favourite star wars character making an appearance at the end sooooooooo, it gets bonus points! 

Also, lighting? I saw people complain that it looked like a fanfilm and the lighting was shitty. Vader and Kenobi in episode 3 is visually, some of my favourite stuff from star wars in general, maybe I'm just blind to stuff looking bad,  but I was SOLD on that. It felt so raw and real, which is crazy for a world with light swords and walking carpets.

It wasn't perfect. But at the end of the day what is ‘perfect’. thank you, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Slight show spoilers)"
starwars,"With the new Disney shows adding fears has anyone views of the characters strengths changed? Like could Kenobi maybe beat Dooku now? How about Luke, could he beat either? Andy other reconsiderations for the relative power of characters brought about by the finale? New canon power levels"
starwars,I get they couldn't kill Vader but how is obi wan this stupid? Vader said anakin was dead and there's no hope. It was selfish of Obi Wan not to kill him. It's crazy Great move by Obi Wan for leaving a man he knows will terrorize the galaxy alive again...
starwars,"Obi-Wan: ""Anakin?""

Vader: ""Anakin is gone. I am what remains.""

Obi-Wan: ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Anakin. For all of it.""

Vader: ""I'm not your failure, Obi-Wan. You didn't kill Anakin Skywalker... I did. The same way I will **destroy** you.""

Obi-Wan: ""Then my friend is truly dead. I will protect and train his son Luke and Luke's twin sister Leia is already in great hands. Anakin and Padme would be proud. Goodbye, Darth."" Vader would have died if Obi-Wan said this in episode 6:"
starwars,"Seriously, why do people not just get a grip? One of the weirdest points I've seen here is how people think Reva shouldn't be forgiven because she ""butchered civilians and hung a Jedi's body for everyone to see"" and like - first of all, we never actually see her really kill anyone if my memory serves me right, second she was hunting that one Jedi in the beginning with the Grand Inquisitor and Fifth Brother, and it could easily have been one of them for all we know.

And third - how many people did Vader kill? In the Kenobi series alone? How many did he slaughter during his whole tenure? Does anyone have a problem with HIM being forgiven? What's with all this Reva nonsense?"
starwars,Bo-Katan Kryze and Sebulba are elite names. Who Has the Coolest Name in the Galaxy?
starwars,"Overall I thought the episode was pretty good, especially for those who haven’t watched Rebels. However, I couldn’t help but notice that the Kenobi-Vader fight was eerily similar to the Ahsoka-Vader fight in the Rebels Season 2 finale. Things both fights include:

-Vader initially thinking he defeated his foe (throwing Ashoka off the temple cliff and burying Kenobi under rocks)
-Vader’s foe coming back with a surprise attack
-Vader’s foe slicing a chunk of his mask off, revealing Anakin’s face and a cool hybrid Vader/Anakin voice
-A subsequent conversation between the two where Vader’s foe tries to appeal to Anakin and apologizes for past mistakes (Ahsoka telling him she won’t leave him like she did before and Kenobi apologizing for failing him)

Again, I think the episode was good, but as somebody who watched and loved Rebels, it really feels like the writers saw a great, impactful fight and just copy+pasted it into Kenobi hoping people wouldn’t notice, even down to word-for-word lines. Just my two cents! My small gripe with the Kenobi finale"
starwars,"I'm well aware that my title can apply to so-called ""News"" channels about literally anything, but it just feels far more stupid when it's something like a Star Wars show.

Take [this](https://youtu.be/gWqoOrDk8II) video for instance. It's a ten minute video talking about how Ewan McGregor was apparently frustrated with Kathleen Kennedy about various creative decisions. Now if the stuff in the video was true, I'd definitely be annoyed by a lot of it. The thing is he doesn't provide a source for anything he says in the video.

He claims that they come from leaks, but doesn't provide any links to the leaks or even show screenshots that at least TRY to prove the legitimacy of anything that he's saying.

And the comment section eats it all up because of confirmation bias, it's really a shame. Star Wars YouTube channels really love making stuff up."
starwars,"It was a short video about a guy explaining why revenge if the sith is the best movie, he was jokingly being dramatic in it, said it had the best opening scene, best lightsaber battles, and everyone hates the dialog yet it has probably the most quoted scene, think it was on tiktok, thanks Trying to find video about Revenge of the Sith"
starwars,"We see Kenobi and Vader hurling huge boulders at each other, with Vader mentioning “your strength has returned”. Ones a Jedi master and the other a Sith Lord and we’re to believe that Rey accomplished the ability to clear a cave-in with a few lessons from Luke? Within the first year of using her abilities? Scene in Kenobi ep. 6 makes TLJ even more ridiculous [Spoilers]"
starwars,"Just curious, I thought it looked cool and wanted to hear what other people think. Thoughts on Andor trailer so far?"
starwars,"Overall I did enjoy the show, the final two episodes were pretty spectacular. But the first 4 episodes besides the 3rd really felt slow and the writing wasn’t the best. Not to mention sometimes the music wasn’t up to par and &gt;!old anakin during flashbacks.!&lt; How would you re-edit the show, would you make it like 2 hour and 30 min, or maybe a 3 hour epic. What are your thoughts? Who’s gonna make a fan edit of Obi Wan Kenobi now that all the episodes are out?"
starwars,Just curious:  Do most of you like or dislike how lightsabers look now?  With the color saturation cranked up so it bathes the room in blue/red? The way Lightsabers glow now
starwars,I’ve seen so many people think this after the finale. Seriously? Do you guys really think that Obi-Wan is stronger than the Chosen One? Do you guys really think Obi-Wan id more powerful than Darth Vader?
starwars,"It's absolutely maddening that we still have to put up with characters that are Mary Sue's, with unquantifiable powers and have the limelight.

Reva has all the problems of Rey and its crazy this has been allowed to happen again. We are FORCED to like Reva because of the amount of screen time she has, the fact she's getting her own show and she's committed sins that are immediately forgiven.

1. Unkillable - the biggest flaw is that she has survived a lighstaber stab wound twice, but Anakin / Vader of all people who we've seen snap peoples necks and frozen little kids in his base. How on earth is she alive? She has the biggest plot armour in the whole show, yet she should be the most expendable since no lore evolves around her. 

2. Nothing is explained - we're forced to watch her for 4 episodes with no backstory, then we get this flimsy excuse that she's BUTCHERING people and hanging corpses for all to see just to get close to Vader so she can kill him?! But she not only picks the worst opportunity to attempt to do so, but she then snuffs this motivation for trying to kill Luke? WHY?!

3. Personality - it's so hard to find any sense sorrow for her character because she's just a very angry child that is either screaming or whining.

4. Character design - there's nothing unique in her design as she feels like a rip off from lots of characters.

5. Sins - how she is forgiven for killing jedi and hanging them in the streets, trying to torture Leia and kidnap her, snuffed out the rebels trade route, slicing innocent people's limbs, ordering the attack on the outpost, and whatever she did to get in the position is mindblowing. Just because she chose not to kill Luke because she saw that she was killing herself?  What fantastic screen writing...

All people wanted was Kenobi, Skywalkers, Qui-Gon and some flashbacks. I can't watch this show again, though I'll watch the better moments with Obi-Wan and Anakin on YouTube I'm sure. I'm saddened this is how they wasted their opportunity, I can only hope Hayden Christensen gets a chance to be in Ahsoka and maybe we seem him chatting to Luke. (Kenobi Spoilers) Directors have learnt nothing from the sequels"
starwars,How was Vader taken down so easily? He is arguably one of the strongest if not strongest force user and warriors in the galaxy. Yet he gets taken out by a desert hobo after he trains for a couple days. Question about season finale
starwars,"Obi wan defeating Vader and let him alive make 0 sense, the one in Mustafar was acceptable because anakin was burning alive, but what excuse he have this time to don’t finish the job? His feelings? His feelings worth more than the whole galaxy? Now every planet that Vader destroys, every innocent people that Vader kills is on Obi-Wan hands

Darth Vader should have won ( and no win a fight doesn’t mean kill Obi wan) Obi wan vs Vader"
starwars,"Kenobi has now defeated Vader twice, and this time, Vader is much more powerful than he was on Mustafar. 

Is he on the same level of force powers/dueling capabilities as Anakin/Vader, Mace, Yoda, Palpatine, etc? Yes, he has defeated Vader twice, but was it due to him being more powerful? Or was it due to other factors? Such as being familiar with each other's dueling styles or capitalizing on Vader's weaknesses - his need for victory blinding him &amp; his need to prove himself.

I'm curious how Kenobi's raw force powers and dueling capabilities would compare to the greatest of the Jedi &amp; Sith. Thoughts? How powerful is Kenobi by the end of the show?"
starwars,In the the tv show obi wan kenobi... Can someone explain me how Darth Vader can be an adult if he is twin with Leia who is a child? Im completly lost... Is the timeline completly broken??? I'm completly lost...
starwars,"Okay, hear me out. I've watched almost everything Star Wars has to offer. But no matter how badly a character is hurt, often the character will just heal because they put him in a bacta tank for Space Jesus knows how long. I mean Luke, Boba Fett, and Anakin, all survived because of a bacta tank. 

If this is all possible in the Star Wars universe, Mace Windu must be alive if someone took care of him after he got electrocuted and his hand was cut off.  Windu was one of the best trained Jedi and was great with the force. So I guess he could be alive. 

It's bold, I know, but still, I like speculating. Is there any chance Mace Windu could be alive?"
starwars,"In episode 3 of Kenobi Vader says to Obi Wan ""I am what you made me."" 

But in episode 6, he says ""I am not your failure. You didn't kill Anakin Skywalker. I did."" 

In a rare moment of self awareness by Vaderkin, he actually changes his statement completely, shifting blame off of Obi Wan and onto himself. I theorized that it was a brief flash of Anakin taking the responsibility off of Obi Wan. My mom thought it was an attempt to regain control of the situation(he is winning the fight in episode 3 but has been beaten badly by ep 6). It's pretty rare for Vader to contradict himself or go back on his statements. What do you guys think? An interesting change of statement"
starwars,"Prior to the Disney+ shows, I had completely given up on Star Wars. I know this dead horse has been beaten over and over again, but I absolutely hated the sequel trilogy and til this day I wish Lucasfilm will come our and say it's not canon, but whatever.

However, Disney redeemed itself with Obi Wan. Holy moly, this is exactly what we wanted, well at least me. I wanted to see the aftermath of ROTS and order 66 how Darth Vader would interact with Obi Wan. 

This show started slow, but wow it was a fantastic progression. The absolute brutality of Vader and the way he hates and blames Obi Wan. Anakin's character build up from episodes 1-3 it all just culminated here. 

Obi Wan Part 6 shows exactly how Anakin ended up. He was fully consumed by the dark side and it couldn't have been executed any better by the directors and writers, everything was just so fanastic. You could see and hear his pain, agony, and emotional suffering in that final duel with Obi Wan.

Disney, WE NEED MORE OF THIS! Make a season 2!

Give us more Obi Wan vs Darth Vader! Leia too she was fantastic. Reva, show her become a rebel and show he fighting the Grand Inquisitor and build up her character even more. This show has a lot of potential for another season.

But Disney, BRAVO! I cannot get over Obi-Wan Part 6"
starwars,"One of the most striking features of the Obi-Wan Kenobi series is how little Vader has changed in the 10 years since his fall. Nothing about his words or actions suggest the possibility of returning to the light. Looking back at the original trilogy, the change really doesn't begin until after Vader vanquishes Obi-Wan. Obviously, that's close enough to the same time he learns that his son is out there, but it still seems like removing Obi-Wan from the picture opens up the possibility of Vader actually moving on.

Did the vengeance against Obi-Wan have to happen for Vader to finally realize how hollow that quest actually was and put him on the path to seeking something beyond the dark side? Did Obi-Wan stand in the way of Anakin returning to the light?"
starwars,"I have ADHD so I tend to watch everything with closed captioning. While watching the latest Obi-Wan; during a fight it said (lightsaber clashes) and that made me really curious as to how you imagine lightsabers clash? My guess is that you almost imagine it like feeling some sort of bass that goes through your chest a little every time they hit each other! Please, let me know! Deaf Star Wars fans : What do you imagine light sabers sound like?"

And people seemed pretty receptive to it, and I've recently developed more of the idea. I'm a roleplayer with a pretty shallow knowledge (and interest, honestly) of the setting but would like to know how the community feels about the character presented. If you want some idea for the context you can look at my profile if you want, but it's not really important.  


A former slave is nearly killed by a highly isolationist (they kill all witnesses) and reclusive sect of Mandalorians who're contracted to kill her master when, after being offered a merciful death by the clan leader for putting up a difficult chase, she bites down on his hand manages to bite his thumb off.  


Ordering his comrades to put their weapons away and laughing while his stub continues to bleed, he offers instead to allow her to join them so that she can learn how to defend herself, how to live free without being exploited or used by others. She agrees, naturally, and in a bizarre moment of joviality he gives her a piggyback ride back to their home deep within the slums and alleys of Nar-Shaddaa, collecting his finger as a momento of this wily slave they stumbled on that clearly has much to offer them.  


Growing up with them she turns out to be a tolerable enough fighter, but their clan is more interested in softer skills anyways which she's talented at; blackmailing people, lying, detecting lies, knowing how to see the worst things in people and how to take advantage of their vices and weaknesses, fabricating evidence, tampering with police evidence, splicing camera footage; they give her the nickname 'Hindsight' because of her role in obfuscating their presence, making it so that they can go unseen.  


The story / RP properly opens with the discovery of their clan leader's corpse, a man that she'd developed a mutually fond and loving paternal relationship with despite him trying to kill her, sending her into a web of mystery and discovery as she's tasked with finding who did it. She's the one that does all the work in hiding the trail they leave behind after all, so she's the best person they can ask for to track them down.   


Our lead Mando personality-wise is kind of a slick, smooth talking Jimmy McGill. Their clan doesn't pride itself on brash action and usually doesn't even wear their armor when out and about, so she's become very good at talking her way in and out of things, all flashing smiles and nudges between scenes of gunslinging action and violence with slavers and gangsters and Hutts as she frees slaves and chases whatever loose ends she can get her hands on.  


That's it. Mostly just looking to see if people think 'Wow, that's pretty cool' or 'Wow, that's pretty uninteresting.'   


TLDR. Princess Bride Inigo Montoya Mandalorian adventure except shooting slavers in the face. Noir / Sin City-inspired Mandalorian story on Nar-Shaddaa."
starwars,"Let me preface this with I loved the way they handled Vader and Obi-Wan in the final two episodes.

How did you feel about: *Obi-Wan leaving Darth Vader alive for a second time.*

- Knowing that anakin his friend is truly dead and that Vader was the one to kill him.

- All the destruction Vader has caused the galaxy.

- Knowing that Vader will do anything to find him (which puts the twins at risk)

- In his meditation to Qui-Gon, he prepares for the battle to lead to the death of either him or Vader

Obviously he had to leave him alive for OT purposes, but what do you guys think? Kenobi Episode 6: How did you feel about ____?"
starwars,"I don't really post much, I usually just read what everyone has to say. It's great to see that people in general really like the Kenobi series and are satisfied with the finale. What's more interesting is that different people had different takeaways and impacts from the many bits and pieces you see that link things up to the prequels and sequels. 

I must add, that it's incredibly difficult to write a story which has a binding past and future, but oddly enough it's the 2 stories that have this constraint (Kenobi and Rogue One) that have actually done well in the post Disney takeover and not created significant plot holes, where others have been just satisfactory or a downright failure (except Mandalorian perhaps). 

These constraints do have a darker side though, I do understand why those involved may have wanted to keep it short and a limited series. Sure there are some scenes which make you go ""Ohh why not do this and why do that and convolute the plot and what not"", but it's not a big deal.

It also does really well to add deeper meaning to several dialogues and scenes in the original trilogy which may have previously made you go ""Eh?"" or feel a bit off. I have a lot to say about the tiny details and hypotheticals which I'm glad it answers, but I'll leave this spoiler free. If you haven't watched it, watch it please! Great to See Everyone Happy (No spoilers)"
starwars,"There is talk about producing a season of the show. KK has suggested that if there is enough engagement and demand that they will do so. Even Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor want to.

Here's the thing though. I feel like where this season ended was just right. So what could they possibly do that won't undo what was done in this season or to hurt the overall Canon?

My two ideas:

1. Have a season two but from the perspective of Vader. Same timelines, same emotion, different perspective. 

2. A lot of people, myself included, would have liked to see more prequel era content. Flashbacks are sometimes controversial due to their lack of investment. So how about a selection of the clone wars episodes brought to real life? You could get the whole gang together without taking anything away from canon.
Only real con would be de-aging CGI.

What are your ideas? Obi-Wan Kenobi season 2"
starwars,"Maul asked "" is it the chosen one"" and obi wan said yes, are they referring to Luke? In rebels when obi wan defeated maul..."
starwars,I think that Anakins father is Palpatine. Heres why. In Revenge of the Sith Anakin can see dreams into the future. Clues show Palpatine can do that too. Plus in Phantom Menace He has a insane amount of medacolorian counts. And its kind of the same story as Rey's in the sequels. So thats why I believe this. Who is Anakin's Father?
starwars,"I’ve only seen the movies, the first season of The Mandalorian, and like three episodes of The Clone Wars. I want to be able to watch Kenobi and other new shows as well as play Jedi: Fallen Order. It seems like I should watch the Clone Wars then Star Wars Rebels and then the next season of Mandalorian. Is that a good way to experience the series? I’m trying to get more into the series. Any ideas where to start?"
starwars,"For me, it’s -

Top Tier - Clone Wars Final Season, Rogue One, Mandalorian, Kenobi

Very Good - Rebels, Force Awakens, Solo

Good - The Rise of Skywalker, Book of Boba Fett

Underwhelming - The Last Jedi

I would also put Galaxy’s Edge (theme park land) in the Very Good tier. Rank Obi-Wan Kenobi amongst LucasFilm Disney projects"
starwars,"Obi Wan, a few years removed from the events in season 1, meets up with an adult Luke to rescue Leia once again. This time she's been captured by Vader rather than the Inquisitors, making it much more high stakes for everyone.

starwars,"Anyone notice that during the Obi Wan vs Vader fight, the reason he wins is that unlike the majority of his duels, he is far more aggressive and uses a lot more of Anakin’s moves such as the twirl behind his back to put Vader on the defensive 

I think this was a great throwback to part V as well as obi wan emphasises to Anakin how aggressive his fighting style is compared to his, so it makes sense that Vader would be so thrown off guard and be defeated after being put on the defensive the entire battle, and having his opponent that he’s known for decades fight completely differently Something interesting I noticed about the Obi Wan Kenobi finale"
starwars,I thought that he didnt perfectly find out how to live an immortal life and therefor only became a voice? Also when did he show up in kenobi How comes you could see qui gon in kenobi?
starwars,"...is it ever explained why he is killed off in The Clone Wars series when he was already killed off in ROTS? 

I'm watching The Clone Wars for the first time and I gotta say that really surprised me. I know he is basically killed in the same way as ROTS but why do it twice in two different scenes, especially when they are both cannon? Is this ever mentioned/explained? Watched Count Dooku die in The Clone Wars..."
starwars,"Spoilers for Kenobi


It’s not a setup to a terrible joke, but a pretty neat parallel I noticed in Episode VI of Kenobi. 

Reva is very much like Anakin in AOTC - impulsive, angry, conflicted. She also is dealing with a lot of unprocessed trauma from Order 66, like Anakin was dealing with his and his mother’s history as slaves. 

This naturally leads to anger in both of them. While Anakin hides it from the Jedi, Reva has nowhere to go and winds up with the Inquisitors, who stoke that anger for their own ends. 

For both, they hit a breaking point. For Anakin that is his mother’s death at the hand of the Tuskens and for Reva it is getting “killed” once again by Vader.

They both respond by going out into the desert with murderous intentions (Anakin was already there, but it was on his mind before Shmi died). Anakin kills them all, children included. Reva is focused on one person in particular, Skywalker’s son, for her revenge. But she doesn’t go full Anakin, she can’t take revenge. 

And here’s the visual parallel — Anakin and Reva walking out of the desert to the Lars homestead with a body in their arms. Anakin carries his dead mother, and death is the choice he has made, turning for that first real moment to the Dark Side. But Reva, who has turned to the Light, carries a living Skywalker, and returns him to Owen and Beru. I wonder if they remembered seeing Anakin walking that same way, carrying Shmi. Pretty cool moment. Two conflicted Force users go out into the desert… [spoilers]"

starwars,"So many gems! AT-ST's. AT-ST's. AT-ST's. Basil Oregano, played by Jimmy Smits. He's Princes Leia's non-biological father!
The list is endless!
Star Wars is truly creatively bankrupt. All the talk about the Kenobi finale and I couldn't help but be reminded of Red Letter Media's now legendary Rogue One intro!"
starwars,"Let me explain.

Anime, while having compelling stories and (sometimes) groundbreaking animation, has one glaring flaw in its stfucture. And that is the filler episodes.

If you watch the medium, you already understand where I might be going with this.

If not, let me explain.

In anime they have the main storyline with the main cast of characters going against progressively tougher villains until the story concludes naturally or the creators run out of ideas and/or source material. However, during some of the more griping story arcs, they will pad for time(and episode numbers) by adding non-sequitor adventures that deal with secondary or tertiary characters doing things that may or may not link in some way to the main story line.

An example, off the top of my head, would be during Dragonball Z when we had ? number of episodes dealing with the Saiyaman arc which was, ultimately, just an excuse to get Gohan and Videl together, nothing else really.

And thats what the first 5 episodes of Kenobi were. Filler.

To the best of my knowledge we didnt really get anything the pushed the character forward outside of a side quest adventure helping Leia get out of a jam due to his chosen duty to look over Luke. Again, as far as I know, Obi Wan really doesnt have much character growth through the first 5 episodes of the show, but during the 6th episode(when we pick back up with the main story started in the first 3 movies) we have the culmination of the Obi-Wan arc going from somewhat resentful older brother taking on an unwanted but important duty to finally coming to peace with the death of, as well as his part in the downfall of, his closest friend and brother.

I had high hopes for Obi-Wan because Ewen MacGregors portrayal in the prequels made Kenobi one of my top 5 Jedi, but now that its done I feel the entire thing could be ignored outside of the finale.

But thats just my 2 cents and I'd like to know if anyone else feels the same way or might be able to give me their certain point of view on the series in case my knowledge didnt pick up on something, or I just straight up missed an important detail or the like.




My knowledge of cinema comes from almost 4 decades(at this point) of ingesting pop culture in almost all its forms and picking things up as I went along. I may not have the eloquence or training others have in spades but I know a thing or two, itll just come across as ignorant due to the aforementioned setbacks sometimes



Bonus question for fun because the sub doesnt allow polls and I thought of this last night watching a video on The Force Unleashed:

Live action Darth Maul, if ever brought back, should be played by: Ray Park or Sam Witwer? Unpopular Opinion: Obi-Wan, the series was like the worst parts of anime..."
starwars,"How does Darth Vader pee or poo? 

Let's say Vader ate a bad space taco and needed to go like immediately.

Does he just... ""hold my suit for a moment""

What exactly happens here? Serious question that has been bothering me since I was a kid"
starwars,"We now have 11 movies and multiple tv shows that haven’t explored the multiple lightsaber fighting styles yet. 

As Cal and his new master realize he’s going to need more skills than he has to survive with inquisitors and Vader hunting him, they drill in the more advanced styles. Cal having learned Shii-cho, starts by reviewing that as Cere shows him where it’s reasonable against the storm troopers but may fail him if he continues to face others trained in swordsmanship. Each of the first episodes can be dedicated to a style, and throughout the season we can see it out to the test against enemies. As she explains them, we can see flashbacks in the movies where characters are using them (Dooku and Makashi, Obi Wan and Soresu, Mace Windu and vapaad). Maybe he comes across people like obi wan and Ahsoka to help him improve.

Obviously there’s a plot line going on apart from this. I just think this would be a great opportunity for the viewer to learn to recognize the styles so watching the fights (maybe even the final showdown of master and apprentice in a new hope) are more fun and dynamic to watch! Idea for the Cal Kestis show"
starwars,"Tap into the dark side during his fight with Vader? Specifically I believe he started doing it after he frees himself from the rocks, as his fighting style becomes far more aggressive, erratic and hard hitting. Eventually this culminates in a close up shot of Obi-WAN’s face where he’s looking pretty wild (which is also reasonable under the circumstances and not necessarily indicative of using the dark side) and attacks Vader’s helm [Spoilers] In the finale, did Obi-Wan…"
starwars,"Man, I wasn’t ready. Actually seeing his face inside the mask. Hearing his real voice alongside the modulater. That line. “I am not your failure, Obi-Wan. You did not kill Anakin Skywalker. I did.”

Just. Wow. That moment has changed the way I’ll watch the OT forever. Obi-Wan Finale"
starwars,"With showing us how the characters in the original trilogy got their outfits and assigning some hidden significance to regular items like blasters, holsters, etc.? Kenobi is telling me that at 10 years old, Leia decided how she was going to dress for the rest of her life? I thought that this was something that was unique to Solo, but it seems like Star Wars has decided to double down on this kind of thing. I don't think it hurts the story in any way, but it just seems really needless and weird. why is Star Wars so obsessed now... (Kenobi ep 6 spoilers)"
starwars,"Basically I'm perfecting my writing with a new book, in a new style too!

It is about Star Wars, if you couldn't guess, and I just have some questions that I need help answering (since I am unsure if I'm right or note, and it's better to be safe then sorry no?)

1:Does the force have some limits? Let me elaborate;

(if you're interested, read this): This 'man' I'm making is using the force for his own benefit, credits and what not, but due to some 'accident' his body was left mutilated and beyond recovery. His brain and several important organs were salvageable and were used to make his body back (unlike grievouses, they used most of his credits to make it perfect per se)

Whilst he was normal him and his brother used what knowledge they had to learn the basics (of the force and lightsaber combat), and out of rage he requested there to be added six arms so that he would be unstoppable in his quest for greed.

(question): So, I know it might suck but it is still in experimental phase of writing, could he still use the force due to his body (except mind and several organs) begin just a machine?

2:Could a person use six sabers at once?

3:Which form focuses most in taking down the enemy fast with quick movement?

4:Is greed, in star wars, a good reason to be evil/feared?

5:How do I complete such a task? Meaning;

How do I make him evil/feared?

6:When is the perfect time to add him, I am all lost over the time to add him. (I am fully aware that I'm asking much, lmao like, am I writing this book am I right? But I am fully confused as to where to put him, before the clone wars/after, before or after the sequels/prequels?)

I know I'm asking too much for a person who's writing a book, but I must ask those who know better so that I fully understand how this character will impact the story.

Thanks for reading! (really, ty, this is a lot of text) Hello there everyone, I have some questions that I need help with!"
starwars,"I know the general idea even stated by George Lucas is that Anakin had the potential to greatly surpass Sidious, except becoming the machine Vader hampered his abilities. It also seems to be the case, however, that Vader in the OT era is still a class ahead of Prequel Anakin and most contemporary force users. What he lost in speed and agility he made up for in other ways like durability, strength, and force abilities. Why does it seem to be the case then that he struggles with Obi-Wan in the season finale? For Sith, anger and resentment fuel them, so I would not say it's fair to say that he's just distracted by fighting Obi-Wan. He's also fighting in a totally different way, so it's not like RotS where Obi-Wan is extremely familiar with his fighting style. It doesn't matter that much, as their confrontation is more than just ""who would win"" and more about their character development, but it still has me thinking. Also I will say I have not read the Vader comics, which I plan to do when I get the chance. How would you compare RotS Anakin and OT Vader given what we currently know in canon? Question about Darth Vader's abilities before and after Mustafar"
starwars,"How is Reva still alive? Seriously, this is a bigger problem than you think, in Rebels, Maul knew JUST THAT Obi-Wan is keeping an eye on someone on Tatooine and THATS the moment Obi-Wan knew he cant let him leave the planet. Reva knew about Luke being Anakin son, Bails connection to Kenobi and they still let the biggest threat to Bails rebellion, Lars family and Luke himself live? Kenobi Part 6 Problem"
starwars,"I don't think there is a ton of stuff that needs to be cut. I think Reva should have died after Vader's fight. Or at least, we didn't need to see her in the finale. Since it kind of just looked like Obi-Wan Kenobi was hopping around planets in that episode lol. I would also love to see someone include more original trilogy and prequel music! Duel of the Fates during that last fight? I think that would be awesome. anyone else looking forward to the Obi-Wan Kenobi fan edit?"

starwars,"I feel like I’ve been looking for updates every other day since 2016 about potential Obi Wan news, watching any Ewan Mcgregor interview for some hint of price of information that something was coming…then we got confirmation and buildup of the show, how exciting I felt like a kid again! Now it has come and gone and I feel like I don’t know what to do with myself. It’s been the only thing in my life I’ve had to look forward to and be excited about - I feel so sad, I don’t have much else. Just wondering if anyone else feels this way? I guess because the buildup has been so long and the anticipation, these characters have been so core to mine and lot of others childhoods…the fact that we got to see them again. I feel like a kid in 2005 again who just left the theater thinking well this is it. 

I know there are other things coming out but it’s not the same. 

Don’t really know what I’m saying here - apologies for rambling Is anyone else depressed Obi Wan is over?"
starwars,"Thank you too all involved in bringing this series alive!

I grew up on the prequel movies. As a kid I remember watching The Phantom Menace in 1999, I was 4 years old and I fell in love with Star Wars 

I remember getting a Lego set of Jango Fett ship from Attack of The Clones and flying it around the house 

Revenge of The Sith came out on my birthday, I and went to midnight release in 2005. Every year on my birthday, I watch RoTS. 

These movies as a kid were and still are to me the best. They hold so much value to me growing up. 

Seeing Ewan and Hayden back on the screen, is a childhood dream come true. I am grateful for being able to see it Thank you for Kenobi"
starwars,"I thought the series was absolutely brilliant and I think their last fight definitely tied in nicely with canon. Basically the way I saw it: Vader said he killed Anakin and Obi-Wan responds ""then my friend is truly dead"". He also refers to him as Vader. At that time of the last Kenobi series fight, Vader is still in the learner stage/level of being a sith. Given that Anakin was a trained as a jedi, he has no other point of reference for training levels. Most sith would think they are far beyond, better than any jedi no matter what stage they are in their training/experience. So when they meet in A New Hope, Vader says when we last met I was but the learner but now I am the master. Obi-Wan responds with only a master of evil Darth. Again Obi-Wan knows that Anakin is truly dead and this is only Darth Vader. This fight is the first meeting since that fight in Kenobi, where Obi-Wan finally realized it was only Vader left. I honestly don't think it's a far stretch, but I'm sure others may disagree. [Spoilers for Kenobi Episode 6] Obi-Wan conversation with Vader in A New Hope"
starwars,"Does anyone find the endless ""this scene but with this piece of John Williams instead of the original score"" videos to be tiresome and slightly cringe worthy? 

I actually like the original scores in most new starwars media, even if they aren't by John Williams. 

Whoring nostalgia for views is boring. We don't need ""C fights Y but with Luke's Theme"" or ""X does this but with Duel of the Fates"". Stop it. Not every single scene from new StarWars media needs to have a nostalgic OT/PT score overdubbed onto it"
starwars,"I just finished the Obi Wan Series and am blown away. I want more of this, but what time within the timeline is left?

There’s the Asoka Tano series, but that’s rumored to be set around the same time as the Mandalorian. 

Here’s hoping we have more Star Wars shows with high production value that also feature Jedis. 🤞🏼 What time within the Skywalker saga is left for film adaptation?"
starwars,"One thing I was expecting to see in the Kenobi series was if there were going to be any signs that Luke and Leia were as force sensitive as 9 year old Anakin was but I don't we saw anything like this.

Just curious as to how force sensitive the two actually are/were at 10, if they had any sort of perception type abilities or something else? Young Luke and Leias force abilities? (possible spoilers)"
starwars,"At first I thought it was my TV but I've tested it on different monitors, why is this episode so grainy? All the background is so pixelated especially in the darker scenes, it looks like it's 480p. Why is Obi-Wan Episode 6 so ""Grainy""?"
starwars,"Obi-wan would/ could kill Darth Vader after he defeated him.

BTW... I believe the duel Obi-Wan and Vader had in the last episode was better than the one in ROTS. [Spoilers] Even without the continuity..."
starwars,"Hi guys, completely out of the blue a question came to me...but didn't Obi-Wan ever wonder what happened to Ahsoka? In Episode 3 when he and Yoda are on Polis Massa Kenobi don't mention Ahsoka at all. Of course OBVIOUSLY she had not yet been created at that time but if we look at the big picture of things now, where almost everything is now explained, that thing makes no sense. Ahsoka was Anakin's Padawan but she also spent a ton of time with Kenobi, plus in the season finale of The Clone Wars before Order 66 if I'm not mistaken she also meets Kenobi again, so the least he could do is at least wonder what happened to her. Of course maybe he gave her up for dead because of Order 66 but the point is that in no work, that I know of, does he even give a thought to her in the post-Empire era.

So I'm wondering by any chance has this been delved into anywhere else? Maybe in the novel From a Certain Point of View or something (similar to the part where Kenobi in Episode 4 goes to R2 secretly to tell him that he missed her).

Is there any work where you see him even the slightest bit concerned about Ahsoka? But even just as a matter of ""father-grandson"" concern.

Also, we through Rebels know that Ahsoka (if I'm not mistaken!!!) knows that Kenobi is alive on Tatooine and talks to Ezra about it...but Kenobi on the other hand knows that she is alive? Ezra tells him and tells Kenobi?

In short please clarify my thoughts a bit, thank you all and sorry for the bad English.

PS. But does Rex know that Ahsoka is alive? When Ezra leaves her to fight Darth Vader still didn't know about the world of worlds and Rex almost cries for her, can we assume that Rex then found out that she was actually saved? Or is there even some artwork that shows this? Did Obi-Wan know that Ahsoka had survived?"
starwars,"After watching the season end I now see obi is the true master vader has always been weak obi let him live

starwars,"Evident in the recent material such as the Sequel trilogy or the Mandalorian, the actors are using ""real"" lightsabers that glow instead of the prop swords that they used in the Prequel series. Although it makes more sense for the light to bounce off of the surrounding more when the lightsaber is close, something feels ""off"" in the recent Kenobi series in regard to the lightwork: it feels cheap, too shallow, and it breaks my immersion every time I notice that it's just led-lit glow sticks they're acting with. Does anyone agree with this sentiment? Am I the only one to feel this way? If there are more like me, what do you think is the problem?? Am I the only one who thinks the illuminated effect of the lightsabers look... well... a little cheap in the Kenobi series?"
starwars,"This is a spoiler if you haven’t finished Obi Wan, just a warning. 

I just thought it was very odd that the most powerful Jedi/Sith got bested by Obi Wan a second time when he was essentially at full strength and ObiWan hadn’t used the force or had any training for a long period of time. 

We’ve seen the strength Vader now has in this show and I can totally understand Obi Wan’s will to stay alive for annakins children, but it still seems like a farce given the strength disparity between the two. What are your thoughts? Vader in obi wan series"
starwars,"This guy took Han's advice about ""ancient weapons"".  He can still do force pushes and everything, but just completely gives up on lightsabers and uses blasters, explosives, and other weaponry.  He does things like using the force to improve his aim (like Luke on the Death Star, or Obi-Wan as Rako Hardeen) and make thermal detonators go where he wants.  Imagine Mando, Boba, or Jango with the force. For once I'd like to see a force user that goes all in on ranged weapons"

Well done by CineVore Check out this badass video"
starwars,"Its not at all that I DISLIKED the show... I did not.  I can say with the upmost sincerity that I think it was a fine show.


BUT, what really ""happened"" in the show that was of real consequence or changed our views of any characters?


What new plotlines or backstories were introduced that significantly are making us change how we view any of these characters?


What new and exciting characters were we introduced to, that make you look forward to learning more and more about them?


I dont view Kenobi any differently than I did prior to this series.  Thats not a bad thing, but I didn't learn anything striking or groundbreaking other than an offhand comment that he might have a brother out there.


My views on Vader are largely also unchanged... he's a man fueled by rage and a thirst for power and revenge... to the point it clouds his better judgement repeatedly... this is what led to Anakin's downfall in the first place.  No real change, no great new revelations other than I suppose his proclamation that HE killed Anakin.. 


Leia was a precocious kid who early in the series was borderline annoying, but they toned that back a bit.  We dont really learn too much more about her or see her go on any real character arc of anything substantial.


Luke, well... we dont really get much of anything there.  So thats largely unchanged.


I guess Lars and Beru are really the characters who I'd say we learned the most about and perhaps changed our perception of.  Edgerton did a good job as Lars.  These characters did show growth of sorts.


The Inquisitors... Reva was interesting, but is now gone basically... the Grand Inquisitor and the Brothers/Sisters... we learned more or less nothing new about them.  


My ""complaint"" is that this series seemed more like filler and a large excuse to have Vader and Kenobi have another lightsaber battle.   


I just overall was disappointed because whereas when I watched the Mandalorian, or Boba Fett, or many of the Marvel series... I'm left afterward with that feeling of ""I have to have more... they can't leave me without giving me more""

Whereas this series was fine, but doesn't really move the needle.  I'm largely in the same place I was before this series.


To me, its like someone said ""here are all these amazing ingredients, how about you make a meal""... and so you start imagining the chef is going to make some amazing dish that will knock your socks off.... but then you get served a hamburger and fries.   They taste great... you love hamburgers and fries.  But really you wonder ""why didn't you make something more exciting or substantial... you had all those amazing ingredients to use""


I hear there will be a season 2.   I hope they do something MORE with it... because this left me scratching my head saying... ""thats it?"" Unpopular Opinion I'm sure... The Obi-Wan series was disappointing because it didn't really ""do"" or achieve much..."
starwars,"Now that season one is over, what are your hopes for a season two? Of course, it’s highly rumored that there’s a season two in the works, but to my understanding it’s not final. Please correct me if I’m wrong. What are your hopes for S2 of Obi-Wan Kenobi?"
starwars,"I never really cared that much for Boba, but I did really love the Mandalorian and the Obi Wan show made me want to watch more Star Wars.

I've heard very mixed things about the Book of Boba, so I didn't watch it since I'm not that interested in the character

Is it still worth a watch, or not really? is the Book of Boba Fett worth watching?"

starwars,"I’ve finished the Obi Wan series finally, and after a so-and-so series overall, I couldn’t be more excited when I saw the two of them squaring up against eachother in the finale.

However by the end of it I felt thouroughly flabbetgasted. To me the way it ended, it makes no sense. The fact that Obi Wan could basically kill Vader at any point in their life between Mustafar and A New Hope just screams of lazy writing. 

This has a lot of consequences on the whole world they’re building. How are you supposed to believe that Vader is this powerful, almost invincible force if he struggles so much with a fairly average Jedi. This also completely takes away from Luke’s achievements. Fact of the matter is, in this version that Disney is building with the shows and movies, Luke is completely unnecessary.

Not only does he not serve the role of bringing Anakin back to the light and fulfilling the prophecy(As we learn that Palpatine isn’t even dead), but he also doesn’t even fulfill the role of being the only powerful enough force user to tale down his father. Obi Wan could’ve done that at any point apparently.

The last dialogue was amazing, but it would have been so much more powerful in a stalemate type of scenario, or even more so in a Vader advantage.

Imagine that ultimately overwhelmes Obi Wan, but as the Jedi sees his friend’s disfigured face he drops tears and says he is sorry. Then the same dialogue goes ahead, leaving Vader severely distraught(as seen with the clever blue-red saber light play, symbolizing Anakin tapping into his good side), so Obi Wan manages to say goodbye and escape. This lefts us with the much better ending of Vader being a redutable villain that is ultimately incapable of fulfilling his master’s plans due to his own internal struggles between good and evil Unpopular opinion: Obi Wan really shouldn’t have been able to beat Vader and it oozes of lazy writing"
starwars,"SPOILERS 




SPOILERS 




I’ll be honest, I loved the Kenobi show, I’ll admit parts didn’t make sense in canon, Him forming a personal connection with Leia, Reva knowing who Vader was and what this post is about, Qui Gon Jinn appearing at the end of the show, from what I know this makes no sense in canon as when Qui Gon died in the phantom menace he had only completed part of the training and was only able to manifest his voice through the force. From memory I’m pretty sure Yoda was the first Jedi from the order during the prequels that was able to actually manifest not just voice but also physically appear so it honestly rubbed me wrong that he appeared, would have much rather have just heard his voice. Some people will definitely say I’m just a knitpicking toxic fan but I loved this show, Just somethings don’t make sense to me unless there has been an explanation for it That I haven’t seen. I’d be happy for someone to explain it to me as I would love to not see it as a canon rewrite End of Kenobi Tatooine scene Spoilers for Episode 6 Of Kenobi ahead"
starwars,why does it instantly become one of the most compelling shots of the featured film? Like dayum......it's always such a masterpiece of a take too. When Darth Vader looks out of a space window...
starwars,"To start with let me just say i thought the Obi-Wan show was fine, but ultimately a missed opportunity in my opinion. There were great moments in the series, as well as poor and unnecessary parts. And there were some parts which i liked on paper but I don't think they were executed correctly.

I think the 2 main issues the series had were lack of focus and presentation issues. Both of these would have been solved with a film. There were certain plots included Reva and the grand inquisitor, and certain episodes such as the infiltration of the imperial base, that just felt like padding to what should have been the main story of Obi-Wan discovering Vader is alive, and confronting him.

When i first watched the Mandalorian, I was amazed how good it looked for a TV show, and thought if all the other Star Wars shows looked like that then i'd prefer them over films, as they can tell deeper stories with them. However I personally felt Obi-Wan lost that aesthetic and certain scenes especially felt like a normal TV show, and lacked the big budget feel. Maybe there were issues with Covid that i'm not aware of, but I feel a project with a magnitude such as this should've had the presentation to match.

All in all, i think in the end they tried to stretch too much out of this part of Obi-Wan's life where a simple story would've worked much better. But that's just my opinion. Opinion: Obi-Wan Kenobi would've worked better as a film."
starwars,I said that plo Koon takes all categories apart from experience and it got a lot of dislikes like I got 40 likes and 30 dislikes and was wondering if I was wrong I made a video about Plo Koon vs Ben Kenobi from episode 4 and a lot of people disagreed with me was I wrong
starwars,"The boy already survived once after the fight on mustafar, why he thought was a good idea to make the same mistake twice and not killing him? What Obi wan was thinking when he left anakin after the final fight?"
starwars,"Appreciation post.

Owen didn’t ask for any of this to happen to him.  Neither did Baru.  He watched Anakin come to try and save his mother, comes back with her body, then abruptly leaves.  A few years later,Anakin’s old jedi master brings him and Baru a baby to take care of.  Family.  Luke. Neither of them expected that to happen and perhaps didn’t even want that to happen, but they took Luke in and raised him as their own.

Then that same old Jedi, Obi Wan, comes out of hiding 10 years later and brings with him an Inquisitor, Reva.  Owen and Baru, because of their love for Luke, of course defended him and defended him bravely.  Owen basically uses a large stick against Reva’s lightsaber just to at least try to defend his family, even if its futile.  Baru also distracts Reva long enough for Luke to attempt to run away.  All for a child they didn’t ask for and took in anyway, who they learned to love as their own.

Then 9 years after that, they are doing the best they can to raise Luke away from all the mess that his father and Obi Wan were part of.  And then are murdered by the empire, who weren’t even looking for Luke, they were looking for the droids.  

Its a pretty tragic story, but i have a newfound appreciation for both him and Baru.  Their sacrifice eventually led to the fall of the empire after Luke joined the rebellion.  May the force be with them. Owen Lars"
starwars,"*No storyline spoilers*

For a series that has come out in 2022, surely CGI is at the peak of its life. Yet how does Star Wars seem to get it wrong all the time? Grand Moff/Leia just to name a couple.

Ewan Macgregors stunt double during the lightsaber duels looks nothing like him and is clearly not him and I can't see past it, somewhat ruining the series for me. I know its not pivotal to the storyline or and its a must but they couldve done a better job. We're in 2022. They have tried to mask his face with hair and we'll placed shots but during the up close duels in the dark with only the light from the saber reflecting onto the face, it's clearly not him. Surely they can superimpose Ewans face or even during the close shots, stick Ewan in there, all he has to do is hold a saber?!

How in 2022 are a company as big as Disney and Star Wars making series as good as Mando and Boba but I can't help feel Kenobi has fallen short of the mark. Kenobi stunt double"
starwars,"After hating almost every second of episodes 8 and 9, all these star wars’ tv shows urge me to think: what a time to be a star wars fan. I’m so happy that they are using well what this amazing universe has to offer. I hope the fan base will not criticize these efforts, because halting this raise of interest in the franchise would be a shame. Finally happy to be a star wars fan"
starwars,"Otherwise, I thought the show was amazing beginning to end. My only gripe with Obi-Wan is the lack of other life forms on Tatooine other than humans…"
starwars,just because ep 5/6 were pretty decent doesn't take away the fact that ep 1-4 were so meodicre. can people not understand that? why are so many people now acting like kenobi was the best show ever just because ep 5/6 were decent?
starwars,"James McAvoy for me I think. 

He would suit a wise Jedi master now in his mid forties. However he could play most roles as he's an incredible actor. 

Maybe we won't see any ""jedi"" related things for a while though, so in exchange of that I'd love to see him as a pilot of some kind, maybe for the rebellion. An actor/actress you'd love to see in future Star Wars projects"
starwars,"Cos the majority of his modern content is set when he’s wearing his original suit. And honestly I way prefer his Ep 6 suit a lot more. The shoulder pieces sell me more on his mobility and strength and overall the suit just looks better to me. 

Really hope we can get some content set when he’s in his later suits some time. It just hit my why I’ve been thinking Vader looks less intimidating for a while"
starwars,"It’s getting almost as irritating as people hating. I like the large majority of what we’ve gotten so far too!  However, we are about to enter Marvel-type level of content in terms of quantity. I’m a 31-year-old, lifelong SW fan. With Obi Wan (which I liked a lot) coming to an end, I want new stuff. Quite frankly, I’m tired of seeing Tatooine. The Skywalker story is, and always will be, the bedrock of what makes SW so great. But let’s move on. We have a huge universe, spanning thousands of years to explore. Tired of “I don’t know why people don’t like *blank* because I just love the content!!!!”"
starwars,i feel like alot of people issues with the series could have been avoided if it was all released at once. i get why disney want to release it slowly as a show because it keeps disney plus suscriptions running but still. Kenobi should have been a flim or all episodes released at once.
starwars,"- Star Destroyer chasing rebel ship is an embarrassing sequence (expecially compared to the similar 40 yo sequence in ESB with the Millennium Falcon!) 

- Vader burying Kenobi and leaving him there (thinking he was dead? When he can spot his presence from miles?) is a no sense . Luckily Kenobi saves the scene engaging him again (""Hellooo Darth, I'm not done yet!"") 

- Kenobi leaving the planet without being pulled down by the Star Destroyer (disappeared!) is another no sense. 

- Kenobi that reaches Tatooine in half of a second, on time to live the secondary plot of the episode (like ""it's done with Vader, let me see what I have to do now. Oh, Luke"") is quite funny. 

- Luke that didn't spell a single word in 6 episodes is hilarious. Kenobi ep. 6 no senses and what I didn't like"
starwars,I remember hearing a term used to describe minor background characters that fans tend to gravitate toward but I cant remember. An example might be Selacious B Crumb Name for background characters in SW that gain fan popularity?
starwars,Hot take: Anni-Vader stopped his child from being murdered by Reva Just finished Obi-Wan
starwars,"Would you guys like to see a series about Reva? What happened after episode 6? I know it ain’t good to make a show about every single Star Wars character, but I really feel like in the end Reva’s arc made sense and deserves to be expanded. If only a little bit…. Obi Wan episode 6 spoilers!"
starwars,"&gt;!Nice close contact English saddle you've got there.  I wanna know what brand that is that the leather has lasted that long.. lololol

https://i.imgur.com/zReh8GW.jpg! &lt; Me.... absolutely cackling"
starwars,So I may have been drinking but I had a question for you wonderful people. I watched a bunch of videos on starkiller and his affinity for force lightning. Could a force user have such control that they could form a lightsaber alternative from pure force lightning. Again been drinking so I apologize if this has been asked or is a issue Question could you form a weapon out of force lightning
starwars,"How come they didnt just send out a squadron of tie fighters during that ship chase. could have dealt with the rebel ship in an instant. and how come stormtroopers have been so incredibly useless in every episode, theyre supposed to be the empires most elite troops, but they get blasted by a bunch of farmers. and how are the farmers shields so effective, if a slab of metal can be used to block a blaster bolt, how come it hasnt been used before, and what was even the point of beskar in the mandalorian if iron does the exact same thing. ep 6 made no sense."
starwars,"So, I mostly enjoyed the show; there were a lot of plot contrivances, some potential conflicts with the OT, etc but the show's heart was in the right place and Hayden and McGregor killed it with their performances. I feel like it could have been two episodes shorter and dropped the Inquisitor plot altogether and been a tighter, more enjoyable show for it. 

They said, I have a couple of questions that I'd like if someone could clarify for me: 

- In the final episode, is there any logical reason a squad of Tie Fighters didn't pursue the refugees when Vader decided to go after Obi-Wan? 

- Similarly, what was Reva's motivation for hunting down Luke? Unlike most, I liked Reva overall and thought her arc was fine, but this part didn't click for me. Nothing in Bail's message explained Luke's connection to Vader and at that point she wasn't really an Inquisitor, which itself was a front.

- This one's more vague and I know it's something the series has struggled with for awhile but, how do people think the Jedi are a myth when Inquisitor squads are running around actively hunting them and grilling the populace to do it? I know this isn't the only media placing Inquisitors in this time period (i.e. Fallen Order) but having them literally on Tattooine makes it all just feel a bit silly. Obi-Wan plot questions."
starwars,"I've basically only watched the main movies + Solo and Rogue One and yet I call myself a fan Star Wars. 

I know there's ton of extended universe content, Ashoka is an important character, there's another Duel between Maul and Obi want and so on. 

Having watched the last episode of Obi Wan (like all of us here) where would you say is a good point to jump in to ""continue"" the story? I feel like it's implied that Obi Wan goes on to do more things that fans (besides myself) know about. Where to go from here?"
starwars,"Of the many missteps made by TROS, to my mind the single biggest was the decision to bring the Emperor back to life. Whereas I think the more natural direction to take from where TLJ ended would have been for Ren to be the principal antagonist, as I believe was the case in the rejected Duel of the Fates script.

If the Emperor was not brought back as a ringer at the last minute then to my mind we would have avoided the innate silliness of ""the emperor somehow returned"", Rey would have remained Rey from Nowhere rather than being either a Palpatine/Skywalker and the trilogy would have felt more cohesive with the final film jarring less with the ethos of the second.

How much of an improvement if any do you think moving the story in that direction would have been? And if they had done so, how would it have best played out? With Ren being redeemed as he is in TROS? With Ren having the chance to be redeemed but rejecting it, with Rey coming to the realisation that someone having good in them doesn't mean you can save them from themselves or their decisions/actions? Or with an entirely different dynamic that isn't centred around the possibility of redemption for Ren? Would having Kylo Ren as the principal antagonist for the final sequel film have worked?"
starwars,"Episode 6 spoilers 




SPOILERS SPOILERS 



So, almost around the end of episode 6 of Kenobi when Vader and Obi-Wan have that final duel, when Obi-Wan Unmasked Vader, Vader says something very strange. He tells Obi-Wan that what happened to Anakin wasn’t his fault, that it was Vaders fault.  Basically saying he doesn’t blame him for what happens, so why was he hunting him? Do you think it means that he forgave Kenobi for what happened? I’m genuinely a little confused over it [Kenobi Spoilers]Does Vader Blame Obi-Wan?"
starwars,"People say he lost, but after watching the duel I don't see it. To me it looks like a stalemate, ending with Obi just giving Vader the win. That wasn't Vader winning, though. That was Obi playing 4D chess, imo.

So can anyone explain? it doesn't look like there's a winner in the fight. how did Darth Vader win in a new how against Obi-Wan according to some?"
starwars,"The one thing missing from the Obi-Wan Kenobi finale was a retaliatory jab from Vader on the fabled high ground. 

I always hated that scene as it serves as a payoff without setup. There should have been a training duel in Attack of the Clones in which Obi-Wan beats Anakin, explaining how he had the high ground. Then the duel on Mustafar would have had more thematic relevance. We could have had a flashback in the show do this retroactively, then Vader stick a sick burn when he feels he has finally beat Kenobi, and everything would come full circle. “Now it is I who has the high ground.”"
starwars,"Because despite a seemingly high budget for each episode, “The Book of Boba Fett” and especially “Obi-Wan Kenobi” felt like they were held back by a restricted and rushed filming process.

It’s hard to directly put the finger on what didn’t work, but I can say with certainty that the first two seasons of “The Mandalorian” looked better and more in line with the films as if more thought on how to shoot and edit each episode went into it. The use of huge LED wall “The Volume” used for many scenes was also way less apparent than it is now.

I enjoyed all of these shows and there were some major highlights I really loved, but I can’t lie and not say that other big TV productions like Stranger Things, The Boys or any HBO show look vastly superior, extremely well-made and basically on par with what we’re used to in cinema. Disney should really increase the budget and improve the production value of future Star Wars live-action TV shows."
starwars,"Is it the force lightning that left him ""scarred"" or is the disfigured appearance his true form? I always thought it was the latter, as force lightning hasn't affected any other character the same way. What is the Canon explanation for Palpatine's appearance?"
starwars," 

Like all surviving Jedi, he reinvented himself, and became a crime lord in some grimy metropolis reminiscent of LA. First two episodes he goes around with pimped spaceships, beating up bad creditors and collecting lace, tarantinesque atmosphere.

But when he is alone, he is torn, memories, remorse, the struggle between the dark side and the call of the force.

Then something happens, and he has to get back into action.

It turns out that just as Palpatine had been cloned: so had Vader. Mace confronts him in an epic duel. The series ends with his redemption and his promise to build a new Jedi school, bringing together the best heroes of the galaxy, the Avenjedi I want a Mace Windu tv show!"
starwars,When I was a kid (around 6-8 years) I used to think that the reason Anakin turned to the dark side was because a piece of dookus blade got into his cut off arm or something. It was really stupid but I still look back on it and chuckle sometimes just a goofy little star wars story from when I was little
starwars,"The (new) motif for kenobi is terrible. It almost sounds like something from Marvel but bad. It’s not even about “feeling” like Star Wars. It’s just not good or inspired music. 

Just sounds like a botched job… Why does the Kenobi score sound Iike royalty free music?"
starwars,"Is it only my opinion, that the ending od ""Kenobi"" doesn't have any sense. Looking at it from Vader's perspective. He knows his master is alive. He lost to him once again. It would seem that after such two defeats, the level of pissing off Obi-Wan will be so high that he will send all available (and probably unavailable) Inquisitors against him. Meanwhile, we see that in Episode 4 both Tarkin and Vader are surprised that Obi is still alive. But ok, let's say that this doesn't matter.
Let's look at Obi perspective now. In RotS he left Anakin on Mustafar because he was sure he was dead. Now he have the chance to fix this mistake. Instead, he just flies away, leaving Vader again... Someone might say that guilt kept him from killing him. I understand that guilt is no longer hesitant to persuade Anakin's son to kill his father? Ok.
By the way, you remember when Obi said to Luke ""you were our last hope"". No he wasn't. Obi was just an lazy mf that could free the Galaxy from this ""twisted and evil machine"" before, but he didn't. Can I just Ask you something?"
starwars,"First of all, let me say that if you liked the show (as I know a LOT of you did) I’m super happy and jealous for you. Really glad you can still stay with loving eyes for this franchise ♥️

However in my case, this show totally did not hit the landing. I’ll admit it has some of the most incredible, coolest star wars/vader moments in the whole saga, and Hayden and Ewan absolutely KILL it, but the amount of stupid, unnecessary, nonsensical shit that happens is beyond me. This absolutely should have been a 2 and a half hour movie about Obi Wan and Darth Vader, period. 

There’s so many weird, uncanny, low-budget moments like the Leia chase sequenceS (can’t believe there’s more than one), stormtrooper slap, bouncing lightsaber, awkward dialogues, bad acting, shaky cam. Also for some reason the VFX looked very cheap to me. 

In my opinion, the series did nothing to justify its existence. Except for that 5 minute dialogue between obi and darth at the end, there’s NOTHING that I feel I was missing out on or that I needed to know in between ROTS and ANH.

Does anyone else feel this way?

*SPOILER ALERT*

By the end of it I was so uninterested that when The Emperor and Qui Gon Jinn appear I was like: “oh, that’s cool”. Such wasted potential…. I did not like Obi Wan and I feel heart-broken"
starwars,"There’s a lot of people wondering why Obi Wan didn’t kill Anakin/Vader for a second time in Obi Wan Kenobi Episode 6. And I think I may know why this happened. I want to take us to a moment in the show where Vader buries Obi Wan in rocks. As Obi Wan is struggling to hold the rocks up from crushing him, he begins to hear the voices of Anakin/Darth Vader in his head, reminding him of how he’s failed Anakin. 

As these emotions begin to rise, notice how he begins to no longer struggle to hold up the rubble. When he’s channeling these emotions, he’s using dark side energy. He flings the rocks away like they’re nothing, and notice how his fighting style changes drastically. Obi Wan is a master in the defensive style of saber dueling. But when he fights Vader after coming out of the rubble, Obi Wan becomes extremely aggressive. He uses the force to pick up tons of boulders and hurls them at Vader. He’s the one who’s engaging Vader and Vader is forced to go on the defensive. Obi Wan even elects to saber bash Vaders life support systems on his chest. 

When Vaders helmet is broken and Obi Wan gets to see Anakins scarred face, Obi Wan sees Anakin’s real face, and not the facade that the mask represent. If he was to kill his apprentice, he would give into his emotions, something that only a Sith would do. Obi Wan’s refusal to kill his apprentice is him “doing what he must” and nothing more. He is actively rejecting the dark side, even when he knows Anakin is completely gone. A theory about Obi Wan Part 6 (Obi Wan show spoilers warning)"
starwars,"I'm not asking if the sequels are good movie or bad to be clear, I'm only saying that I think that the sequels are disliked more for the things that didn't happen more than anything that was actually in them. Its possible to type up a short description of the sequels that seems as if it it would be good on paper, the ultimate triumph of light over dark, the redemption of Palpatines legacy through Rey, love conquers all etc. Maybe the sequels just happened too soon and we needed to see a lot of Han Luke and Leia kicking ass and taking names before and a less abrupt catastrophe that the sequels sort of threw at us. Is the treatment of the original star wars character the only reason the sequels are hated?"
starwars,"This show or miniseries, or whatever the hell was pretty decent! Ewon McGregor got to play Kenobi a lot more and we got more of legendary Darth Vader.

I gotta say, Darth Vader is and always has been a fucking scene stealer. Every single time he appears in a frame, it just dials up to like 15

Don't get me wrong, Ewon is really fucking good as Kenobi, but if anything, he's like the second best thing. I'm more of a casual Star Wars fan, but I do agree that Vader is one of the greatest villains in cinema ever. 

And the fact that we got more of him in this miniseries, done in the best way possible, is badass

He has done plenty of awful things but ya just can't help but love the shit out of him.

And all of the fighting he did with Obi-Wan, so damn well done, &gt;!and I am definitely not used to seeing Vader take an ass whooping, to the point part of his real face was revealed and his real voice could partially be heard!&lt;

James Earl Jones is just as phenomenal as he ever was as the voice of Vader Obi-Wan Kenobi!"
starwars,"so i was watching the latest episode from the kenobi show and in the fight between vader and kenobi you can see that when their lightsabers hit the rocks it shatters them instead of going straight through, is there a reason for that? question about lightsabers"
starwars,I remember growing up and my dad having all three of the OT on VHS. I never wanted to watch them because I thought they looked dumb and I didn’t really like the characters. Then I saw the Prequel Trilogy as a kid and really enjoyed them but everyone I seemed to talk to hated them and said they were bad. As a kid and to this day I love the dynamic of Anakin and Obi-Wan so much that everytime I rewatch the PT I get sad because I know that Anakin is gonna become Vader. As an adult I still don’t love the OT and I still don’t like the characters that much. Han is super pompous and annoying and Luke is a complainer in the first movie and in the third movie after leaving Yoda introduces himself as a Jedi Knight. ( Um no sir you are a padawan at best.) It could just be where those movies came out first and are so old it just isn’t for me BUT my point is I just sat this past week and watched Episodes 1-6 and I did enjoy the OT a lot more this time around. The Prequels are still my favorite piece of Star Wars media but without them I don’t think I’d even look at Star Wars. I didn’t like the OT till I watched the prequels.
starwars,"Obviously theres no other way episode III could end… but after you see their friendship in II and III it always makes me wish obi wan tried harder to knock sense into anakin instead of dueling him right away. 

Even with the obi wan series… i wish they spoke more deeply… i guess we finally got it in the end of episode 6 of obi wan… but still wish there was more . 

And after all these extra scenes… i really wish we got one more scene with anakin and obi talking at the end of Return Of The Jedi instead of just them standing side by side as ghosts… it would wrap things up nicely with one last bit of dialogue towards each other. Anakin and Obi"
starwars,"So, throughout the past 5 weeks that kenobi was being put out, I've seen a lot of comments of being insisting that certain themes and pieces should be used in kenobi (i.e. ""I'm disappointed they aren't using duel of the fates"", etc) and getting upset that there wasn't more  of John Williams music being used. while Williams music is amazing and iconic, I actually like the fact that it was used more sparingly in kenobi. The few times it was used was mainly for specific characters(i.e. the imperial March when showing Vader) cause those themes r pretty much almost like a vital part of the characters on screen presence (which definitely just goes to show just how great Williams music was in the movies). Doing so allows for Williams music to still be a big part of star wars while also giving more opportunities for newer composers to create within the star wars universe. The lack of Williams music in kenobi didn't bother me at all, and even tho the music in kenobi isn't exactly as memorable or iconic as the music from the main saga is, it still fit really well and was great imo. Idk. I'm not opposed to increasing Williams presence in star wars media, but I like the idea of new people getting the opportunity to try and create their own reputation within the musical aspect of star wars. Plus, I feel like the less frequent use of Williams music makes it all the more special or cool when it is used

What r ur thoughts on this? potentially unpopular opinion regarding the music of star wars"

What else can I say. My childhood dream has been realized. My questions have been answered. The man who defined my childhood has returned in the way I wanted. The ultimate Star Wars dream was realized for me and I can’t stop watching the Obi-Wan v Vader fight. 

It only means so much to be a fan of something. It means so much more to feel like you’re a part of something.

Star Wars has given that to people and it continues to do so. So happy."
starwars,"In every onscreen duel or fight I can think of between him and Obi-wan he can never beat the sheer power and will of his old master unless of course Kenobi is an atrophied, rusty, depressed mess.

That's got to be a low blow for the man and fuel his hatred and I love it. Even when he ""wins"" he loses lol.

Watching the Kenobi series *even with its flaws* I couldn't help but become oddly emotional and enjoy the hell out of the last fight. 

All the love for Hayden and Ewan. Anakin never wins."
starwars,"My personal rankings:
*Mandalorian* = 10/10
*Rebels* = 9.5/10
*The Clone Wars* = 8.5/10
*Kenobi* = 8.5/10
*Book of Boba Fett* = 7.5/10

(I haven't watched *Resistance* or *Visions* yet - I know, I need to catch up!)

I didn't watch *Mandalorian* until the second season had fully dropped - and since then I've rewatched it at least four times (not counting rewatches of individual episodes). The introduction of compelling new characters, the natural integration of some known characters (this show is what convinced me to watch *TCW* and *Rebels*), one of the most well-developed protagonists in the franchise who's an awesome character as is but also has a lot of potential for growth (Din Djarin is my fave, in case you can't tell), well-plotted and well-paced stories where even the ""filler"" episodes add crucial development/ context to the overall plot - I just love the show so much!!!

I would write a paragraph about each show, but then I'd be here all night 😂

What's your favorite? Wanted to start a friendly discussion about the Star Wars shows - which one is your favorite?"
starwars,I’ve seen a lot of posts about Hayden and how good he’s been(for good reason). I just wanted to say how incredible Ewan’s acting has been for the show; especially this last episode. *I’m sorry* scene legit made me cry. Quick shout out to Ewan Mcgregor..
starwars,"Sorry if this has been discussed, first time here. But I've seen this stated so assertively in all the analyses. ""Anakin is enraged because he thinks Padme has been seeing Obi-Wan behind his back."" Many channels go so far as to say they *were* in a relationship! Did I miss some behind-the-scenes lore confirmations or something?

I *always* figured Anakin was mad at Padme when he saw Obi-Wan because he thought she'd already sided with the Jedi and had brought Obi-Wan to arrest him. This is kind of evidenced by the fact that he *turns his back* to Obi-Wan shortly after the Force choke and monologues rather than... you know, charging right into his face.

The *only* line I can interpret to even remotely suggest Anakin had an idea about them in his head is, ""You will not take her from me!"" But... I dunno. Kinda always thought he was just saying, ""I won't let you turn her against me in this!""

Am I the only one...? Am I the only one who doesn't think Anakin was upset over a ""thing"" between Obi-Wan and Padme?"

There is no justification for Vaders actions other than to serve Disneys horrible writing. There is so much more wrong with the series as well. If anyone has any good explanations for Vaders actions i’d love to hear them. Vader Not Killing Reva is Completely Out of Character"
starwars,Why couldn’t Obi Wan kill Vader in the last episode? Was it just the emotion? I’m sure he’s wise enough to eliminate the threat of a sith but he didn’t *Spoilers*
starwars,"I'm from the OT generation and although I enjoyed the prequels, I felt they were mostly a history lesson for my favorite movies. Watching Clone Wars certainly helped, but this epic conclusion to Kenobi was just too much. Evan McGregor nailed to such extent I was teary eyed and shell shocked when the episode was over. Indeed, hello there and bravo! Omg, I can finally say I've become a prequel fan"

starwars,"Can we please get a full season based around Vader/Empire? Instead of 30-50% of the episode going to Inquisitors or Leia, it could go to random hermit Obi Wan/Qui Gon trainings or Yoda hibernating. 


We need a season based around Vader and the Empire close to its peak. More Palpatine would be great. Five 1-hour long episodes with +50% Vader/Anakin. Please. Instead of Kenobi Season 2…"
starwars,"Concerning just the original trilogy, what would happen if Luke would later get a terminal illness? An illness that had no cure in the galaxy. 

Knowing Luke, he'd be upset that he'd have to leave his friends and family. Especially in the way he'd go out. Leia would probably feel the same but be more emotional about it. 

But how would Han, C3PO, R2D2 and the others react? Would Luke even let them know what's going on? Would the illness be kept secret from the rest of the galaxy as enemies could use such information against him? And if the illness occurred when Leia and Han have kids, would they tell them about uncle Luke’s problem? Or would it depend on their ages? A Scenario On Luke And Dying:"

Does anyone know the answers to this it's been really bugging me Death Star Reactor Ignition?"
starwars,"Do you think Disney/Lucasfilm would re-do/re-film the original trilogy?

I know the general consensus is 'no'.

It's just that finishing Kenobi and remembering A New Hope (Kenobi and Leia).

I for one would not mind it but I'm completely fine with them not doing it.

Again I don't think they would do it and most people would probably be against it. But what has stopped a movie studio from doing something they probably shouldn't do before?

Just a general thought I had. I really enjoyed Kenobi. Just finished Kenobi and had a thought/question."
starwars,"I really think a Vader show would be great. I know there has been how many comics, but a show staring Hayden as Vader would rock. He loves the role too. 

I feel like a show taking place right after Order 66 would be good, where he tries to deal with what he did to the younglings and what his former master did to him. All while hunting down surviving Jedi. Vader is just so badass and emotionally complex, he needs more focus! After watching the Kenobi finale"

Does anyone else want to know how they found her, cast her, and taught her to do all this? Was she a huge Princess Leia fan before they found her? I'm so curious.

starwars,"We see how strong of a connection Leia has with her adopted parents and I’m sure many of us see them as her “real” parents, and how she is a real Organa. 

Can this apply to Rey as well? She saw Leia and Luke as her family and adopted the name, and they obviously both cared about her. 

Curious on all your thoughts. In my opinion I think is does strengthen the idea. Do you all think the Kenobi show helped strengthen the idea that Rey can be a Skywalker?"
starwars,"Now, obviously it wasn’t all his fault. I blame a multitude of people for the flop of that trilogy. However, he was still the director for TWO of the three movies and thus had a lot of responsibility overall.

I say I can’t fathom his failure(s) because outside of Star Wars, he seems to have a pretty solid track record in terms of movies AND shows (in terms of directing and producing). To name a few:

• *Alias*
• *Lost*
• recent Star Trek movies
• *Super 8*
• *Cloverfield* movies
• *Mission Impossible* franchise
• *Westworld*

How can a person with that list as part of their filmography possibly screw up Star Wars? I’ve read reports of him rushing things on TROS. It’s shocking how someone who, for example, produces a show about robots and human behavior and technology (with complex storylines and ideas), is okay with the line “Somehow Palpatine returned”.

I understand that the main issue was the trilogy not having a coherent story... but JJ made the problem worse (Rian of course shares blame, I’m not defending him).

They should’ve either had Colin Trevorrow or Dave and Jon helm the ST. I cannot fathom why JJ Abrams failed at making Star Wars content"
starwars,"Yet most of the better liked star wars material recently has been older charecters like ahsoka , vader  and obi wan. usually the argument made against adapting legends material was that they had to start fresh with new charecters for the viewership of a new generation"

starwars,"SPOILERS FOR KENOBI FINALE

The fact that Leia and Obi Wan/Ben have a history was resolved in the finale, but I think that scene had a lot more meaning that ""keep this a secret for me."" 

First, keep in mind that Reva kidnapped Leia because Reva believed that Obi Wan's history with Bail would make him want to come save Leia. As soon as Leia was rescued (the first time), she seemed to know that there was something more to it. She even questioned if Obi Wan was her father, because it was clear to her that he was there for *her,* not for Bail. She asks if he knew her parents, and he lies. They grow closer, Obi Wan continues to show her that he deeply cares for her and even does truly love her. All the while, Obi Wan is clearly there for her sake, out of a commitment to her, not just her adopted father.

The last time they see each other, Obi Wan finally admits to Leia that he knew her mother and her father. He not only tells her he knew them, but he describes her for them and the ways she is like them. In that moment, Leia knew that Obi Wan's love for her is born out of his past with her bio parents, not her adopted parents. He says he wants to tell her more, but she says, ""you don't have to."" She knows. ""No one must know, or it could endanger us both."" What can they not know? **No one must know the connection between Leia and Obi Wan is deeper than the fact that he fought alongside Bail in the Clone Wars.** No one must know that Obi Wan is looking out for Leia. No one must know that his love for her has to do with her birth parents - if they knew that it is not a leap to discover who her birth parents are. Surely, if Vader realized that Leia is the same age his child would be and his former brother/father/master was willing to go to any length to protect her... 

That is why in a New Hope, Leia tells Obi Wan "" Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire."" Obviously, it is not Bail who is begging Obi Wan, it is Leia. **But the Empire still believes, and needs to continue to believe, that Obi Wan is loyal to Bail, not Leia. Leia knows the reason for this is because there is something about her parents that would be dangerous for her and her loved ones if the Empire knew. Otherwise, Obi Wan wouldn't have kept it from her.** In her message, she is being cryptic so that if the droids fell into the wrong hands, the Empire doesn't find out about their connection to each other. She calls him General Kenobi, which reminds him of his leadership in the clone wars, but also in the events of her childhood, where the rebels called him General in front of her, but to anyone else it sounds distant. 

In Tatooine with Luke, Obi Wan doesn't mention his history with Leia, because he does not want Luke to know about her just yet. Luke is now aware that Obi Wan was in Tatooine for him, and that Obi Wan knew his father and fought beside him in the clone wars. If Obi Wan was open with Luke about Leia, he might begin to connect dots - oh there's one other child who you are devoted to protecting at all costs, who also is an orphan? 

Leia is not shy about knowing Obi Wan (Ben) when Luke finally saves her in a New Hope. She only trusts him when he says he is there with Obi Wan and she immediately gets up to go find him. When she sees him die, she understands that he just sacrificed himself for her, and she will not waste that by  allowing her emotions to overcome her. She needs to get to safety. 

Even when Obi Wan is gone, the threat over her of her parentage is not. She does not tell anyone, including Luke, about her relationship to Obi Wan because that knowledge still carries with it the same consequences, which she ""knows"" even if just based on how much Obi Wan is willing to do to protect her. 

**When Luke finally reveals to Leia in ROTJ that she is his sister, her reply is ""I Know... somehow I've always known.""** The same way she **knew** when Obi Wan couldn't tell her more about her parents. She's known all along that it was something, and now the pieces are finally put together and the true reality for her is finally realized. 

&amp;#x200B;

... now if they could retcon her ""knowing her mother"" that would be great. Leia Knew."

starwars,"so basically while rewatching the OT a lot of people in ep 4 refer to The Force as an  “old” religion and they barely even believe in it, calling it “tricks” “luck” and even witchcraft (han, the admiral etc). but wasn’t a new hope literally only 19 years after ROTS? if so, all of these people were alive when the jedi were still a huge part of the galaxy? so why do they act as if the Force is an old legend? idk maybe i missed something or they just don’t care a little confused"
starwars,"So if I gave the show a review, it'd be a 9/10. It's not perfect since there's some points that could've either been better or shouldn't have been in (yeah I'm talking to you reva parkour scene) but I thought the show was amazing. For cgi and stuff, it was very off at times but I never cared to focus too hard cuz I wasn't gonna have some weird looking screen ruin the show but I do think it needed a tiny bit more in the over for it to look amazing but then again, it's a tv show so I'm not gonna criticize it too hard since it's not a full movie. But I loved how the show was about obi-wan taking care of leia and also living with the fact that anakin is alive. I thought the actress for leia was really good especially for her age and seeing parts with purely young anakin and obi-wan dueling was a chefs kiss of nostalgia. For the final episodes tho I thought we're great cuz I found reva to be a lot more interesting and scenes with darth vader took the cake since it shows his pure power (ex. pulling down s ship with complete ease, burning kenobi alive, or even just vader slamming kenobi into the ground with rocks with his final words actually sounding like a man torn apart and exhausted rather than just like haha I win). I wanna know what others think of the show now since it's actually done and people can actually give proper criticism without only seeing the first 2 episodes and thinking it's terrible. thoughts of kneobi now that it's over"

Anyway, tonight, my daughter - who mostly watches 22-minute cartoon shows - said she wants to watch Star Wars. I let her pick. ""Star Wars Episode 1,"" she said. Alrighty then.

Not to guve anything away, but the way he says what he says when it all ends… man, talk about pain, that sense of rejection… just brilliant, and I hope he’s recognized for it, that’s all I hope Hayden remains in the spotlight…"
starwars,"I would like to let people know that this will contain major spoilers. Yes, I am fully aware of the series is decades old, but I always like to leave a warning as a courtesy.  With that out of the way, let's continue with the main topic.

As we all know, when Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi first meet, they are discussing topics regarding the Jedi and the Dark times that fell upon the Republic.  When Luke asked how his father died, Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioned that a former pupil of his named Darth Vader betrayed and murdered his father.

The question I have to ask is did George Lucas intend for Darth Vader to not have any family relation with Luke?  When we were first told of the event with Luke's father, it was a rather direct explanation of one person murdering another.  Later on, we found out that Obi-Wan was telling his story from a certain point of view.  Darth Vader was not a person.  He was the physical manifestation of the evil that took over and extinguished the light side that was Anakin Skywalker.

Was this always going to be the storyline since the initial production around the late '70s?  If so, I'm wondering if there are any interviews that can confirm it.  Otherwise, I think Lucas personally had thought of the idea of Darth Vader not having any relation with a main character, but Irvin Kershner felt it was a bigger impact to change that idea for the sequel. I have a some good questions about Darth Vader in ""A New Hope"""

starwars,"Overall, I really enjoyed the Obi Wan Kenobi series. Some holes in the story but overall it gave us more of our favorite characters and showed how terrifying Vader can be.  One thing that I can’t ignore is how the Grand Inquisitor, Reva, and Vader (in that last episode) all walk away after, what seem to be, life ending blows. 

Inquisitors - lightsaber stabs to the chest
Vader - Obi Wan destroys his breathing machine and half of his helmet is destroyed (powerful scene btw).

We couldn’t get any small explanation on how they survived? Barca tanks? Force healing? Other help? Healing"

starwars,"f Lucasfilm approached you and said it was up to you to choose *one* story from a novel, comic series, video game, etc. to be made into a movie/show, what would you choose? You can pick your writer, director, composer, etc.

I’d choose the 2017 Charles Soule “Dark Lord of the Sith” comics series. I’d pick Bryce Dallas Howard as the director, and a team of Andrew Stanton and Dave Filoni as writers. Maybe Charles Soule too! Let’s have Grieg Fraser (Rogue One, Dune, The Batman) as a cinematographer and Michael Giacchino as the composer! Dream Star Wars movie/tv show"
starwars,"I get it, new hope was made in 1977. But I was watching the finale of obi with my pops and after we finished we decided to watch the obi death scene from the first movie.

We actually started laughing seeing the way they were fighting and how obi just dissapeared once he died. I genuinely don’t remember the scene looking THIS bad when I was a kid. Hella funny how that was considered the industry standard back then, look how far we’ve came. God the original movies aged awfully."
starwars,"First of all I enjoyed the Obi-Wan Kenobi show I thought it had some really entertaining moments throughout however, I noticed again a particular flaw with Star Wars in general which is that there is a lack of consistency in the outcomes of duels that is usually chalked up to poor writing when the plot demands something happen. This post I'm going to share some examples of this and how these could have been avoided. These are Episode 1-9 encounters only.

**Rey vs Kylo Ren E7**

Their fights in the sequels are ordered by Rey winning first, tie and then Kylo Ren winning. This doesn't make much sense given Rey is the untrained prodigy whereas Kylo Ren is already trained by Luke Skywalker and destroys the new jedi order. This could have been changed by simply having Kylo Ren win, it makes more sense for the plot anyway as then he could bring her in and try to turn her as they do it the next episode anyway, or she could barely escape.

**Mace Windu vs Palpatine**

There has been a lot of lore as to why Mace Windu won the fight but the intention behind it was that Mace just won. This could easily have made more sense if Anakin rushes in to see Palpatine overwhelming Mace only for Anakin to help Mace and subdue Palpatine but to want to arrest him but Mace is intent that he is too dangerous to be left alive and then Anakin thinks the knowledge to save Padme and bring peace will be lost so he turns.

**Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader E6**

This was already an iconic duel but it would have made more sense had Vader won and Palpatine true to the sith says Luke is too weak and tries to kill him prompting Vader to then fight Palpatine possibly Luke joins and Vader sacrificially kills Palpatine and fulfils the prophecy of the chosen one. It would be poetic that Vader turns on the sith for the same reason he turned on the jedi, for love.

These are 3 instances of the less powerful character winning a crucial duel purely because the plot demanded where there should have been more circumstances that would have made it make sense for the same intended outcome. There are multiple other instances of this happening which I list below.

Maul vs Kenobi E1

Anakin vs Kenobi E3 Fights where the outcome makes no sense."
starwars,The way ObiWan looks at Anakin 😭 someone help It’s 2030 and I’m still crying
starwars,"A strong Force character that happened to be an orphan youngling after 66? Mad at Obi Wan and Darth Vader, presumably for Mace Windu's death? It has to make sense, especially when looking from the Disney pov. &gt;!They set it up perfectly to have an offshoot animated series for her transition after the end of Kenobi. I hope I'm wrong.!&lt; Reva Windu?"
starwars,"If Lucasfilm approached you and said it was up to you to choose *one* story from a novel, comic series, video game, etc. to be brought into live action, what would you choose? You can pick your writer, director, etc.

I’d choose the 2017 Charles Soule Vader “Dark Lord of the Sith” comics series. I’d pick Bryce Dallas Howard as the director, and a team of Andrew Stanton and Dave Filoni as writers. Maybe Charles Soule too! Dream live-action story"
starwars,The title says it all. When was Darth Vader at the height of his power according to canon? When was Darth Vader in his prime ?
starwars,"Recent events have left me wondering how many people have survived his lightsaber. Clearly he is using one of the cheap brands of ligthsaber, like the one Cal uses in Jedi: Fallen order. If I could talk to Vader I would recommend switching to the jedi academy brond of lightsaber as soon as possible so that he can kill all the younglings properly the first time. When that lightsaber goes through the body, it is always a confirmed kill. Darth Vader needs a new lightsaber"

starwars,"Before the Obi-Wan series, the only time we could see Vader in full dynamic whole body action was in games or the animated shows.

The original trilogy sword fights were normal for their time but by today's standards they feel too reserved or missing that UMPH!

Obi-Wan show really had Vader moving. Anyone else at least appreciate seeing Vader in full motion?"
starwars,"When Obi Wan and Anakin battle, obi wan says he has failed anakin, but Vader says it was him who killed anakin, is this him meaning that it was his fault that he had turned into that not obi wan? And do you think it gives closure to Obi Wan at all or do you think he still believes he could have done something? Ep.6 question about scene"
starwars,"I'm not talking about the clone wars. I'm specifically referring to the Naboo Crisis. He killed people in that event, we kind of gloss over that due to the not just the men the women and children too thing a bit later but Anakin was already acquainted with killing from a very young age. 

He flew a starfighter blew up a trade federation Lucrehulk droid ship and in the process killed it's entire crew. He did that when he was  what ten(?)... Yeah I'm starting to think Qui-Gon and Obi-wan messed up. Technically Anakin was a child soldier"
starwars,"Are force ghosts able to be seen by any Jedi who has the maturity/strength to see the ghost of their masters? For instance, if Yoda and Qui-Gon were both talking to their respective masters’ force ghost, could they see the others master. 

If so, could the force ghosts theoretically keep teaching at the Jedi temple, just to the matured apprentices? General question about force ghosts and the Jedi “afterlife”"
starwars,"Vader strangled the captain of the ship who knew where the base was and Tarkis ordered the execution of the princess who knew where the plans were. In Star Wars, Tarkis wanted the location of the rebel base and Vader wanted the Death Star plans."
starwars,I'm trying to get into Star Wars I'm new so I'm trying to watch all of the movies / shows in order. So what is the order I watch the movies in new to Star Wars
starwars,"^(You don't need to read the whole thing, the answer to the title is enough)

I remember seeing memes and clips like the Luke Skywalker scene, but i still didn't watch the series but recently i watched Kenobi because... Kenobi    But it sucked, i literally keep saying ""Disney"" everytime i cringe, see a plot hole or a bad writing

Now the Mandalorian looks good i only watched like 2 minutes but i felt that Disney will do their thing again and again as some Marvel stuff and the latest star wars stuff are horrible

So should i watch it? Is ""The Mandalorian"" good?"
starwars,"Heard that phrase a lot on Vader since childhood. 

But as I was getting older and familiar with cinematography and literature classics, I saw Vader as a pop culture thing within. His motivations in the original trilogy were comprehensible but felt fairy and not moving enough. He was more a toy than a character.  

Then the prequels opened that vast layers of lore on Vaders backstory as Anakin. 

But still, the feeling remained that they are, in fact, two separete characters. 

And as this is true in some way, you couldn't necessary picture how one became another.  

Yeah, we saw evil Haden and the whole suit-up thing. But the transformation was more cosmetical and felt more like a switch-over, as there wasn't enough exploration in between.  

And then came the Kenobi series. After the second episode, I commented somewhere here that it would be cool to see Haden play the transition part from Anakin to Darth, his agony, psychological stress, etc. And they almost gave it here. Just one scene, but boy, it was a home run. Finally, someone went through to show us the transition from Haden to James Earl. The half helmet, the voice switching, and the light play - were effective and spot on. And the lines where Dart admits he himself killed his previous persona with a slight vicious grin - are just classic good-ass filmmaking. So earlier, I struggled to fantasize about how Anakin was adjusting to becoming Vader. And now, that scene filled the gaps where the imagination failed. Now having all the pieces from prequels to Kenobi, I'm having fun with elaborating thoughts on the greatest villain in history, arguably.  

The guy was the most skilled worrier of all galaxy, but still felt insecure, was arrogant and violent, lost his mother, the love of his life and children, felt betrayed and had been punked embarrassingly by his teacher three times now, was dismembered and burned, encaged with prosthetics and eternal darkness on his face, felt enormous pain since and grew mad willpower to overcome it physically, but probably melted down mentally. Everyday face to face with the anguish and thoughts of what he lost for decades. That man was ultimate pain utilizing machine. And all of that I could play in my imagination before, but now the illustration by Haden in that little scene with that little smirk made it reacher and vivid. Now he feels complete. Feel like it would be one of the most iconic SW scenes somewhere near the Mustafar fight.  

And Reva here was sloppy written but essential as an antipode, the example of a victim of violence, who was able to return from the bottom of her dark side due to different reasons, you to decide which.  

Not a fan of writing on the whole, have problems with a lot of weird and dummy choices by the writers and Deborah Chow. But have to admit, they sure did work carefully with the main characters, giving them respect and enrichment. After the finale, you can truly see that. It can be examined immediately, as the first feeling after the end was to turn on A New Hope. The clever work with the pieces of dialogues added weight and depth to the first film. 

Finally, everything felt tied, heavy and dramatic in a classic good way.  

Those last episodes, two fights and some casting choices made light saber duels cool again, Star Wars great again, tying with the legacy neatly. 

So if a claim on the greatest villain is debatable, I feel sure Dart Vader is up to the list now.  

May the force be with him.  

P.S. Just thanks to the legends like Liam, Joel, Ian and, first and foremost, Ewan and Heyden for getting together and putting on a great show for the sake of the galaxy. The most iconic villain ever?"
starwars,"I’m just starting to get into Star Wars and when I get into things I get a little obsessed. So, I’m wondering what suggestions people have if I wanted to buy a cool-but-not-crazy-expensive lightsaber. There seem to be a billion brands out there and I know nothing. I just want to spend like, under $150 and have it look cool and not break if I want to hit some stuff. Any help would be great. Thanks everyone! Newbie looking for a lightsaber"
starwars,"If they made this it could be epic, covering Palpatine's rise through Naboo and galactic politics, his discovery of the force and seduction to the Dark side. And it would be a great excuse to see Naboo and Coruscant on screen again. I only hope they take time with it, plan it out in detail and hire the right person to create it. Series about young Palpatine?"
starwars,"After the fight with Dooku in Attack of The Clones. What happened to Anakins arm? Was it left behind?
I'm no cloning expert but could you not potentially use a severed limb?  Sidious was trying to figure that stuff out and you'd think a clone of the chosen one would be pretty lit. Question about Anakins lost arm."
starwars,I’m constantly intrigued by this lore. Wouldn’t this suggest that the crystals powering their sabers are also sentient beings? Correct me if I’m ignorant. Today I learned that force sensitive Jedi cannot cut off their own limbs due to their personal connection to the lightsaber and the force.
starwars,"For me it would have to be Kanan from Star Wars Rebels, I really am not into that character, imo he’s just very boring What is a Star Wars character most people like that you don’t like?"
starwars,"With Obi-Wan Kenobi in the books, Andor is our next show to look forward to. I'm excited for the show, both due to it's place in the timeline, as well as the characters and planets we'll get to see. 

But that brings me to my question: does anyone have any early theories or predictions about the show? Andor Predictions/Theories?"
starwars,"Each ship should have different characteristics, different strengths / weaknesses, yet it seems now every ship can pull off maneuvers like the Falcon? Disney Star Wars - why is every ship now as maneuverable as the Millennium Falcon?"
starwars,"I really dislike how the Jedi shuns basic human emotions such as love and anger, doing this is the reason people let in all those bottled up emotions and eventually turn to the dark side, this is partially why I liked Luke’s stance in the sequel trilogy of the Jedi having to end.

Isn’t it common sense at this point? The Jedi should be training people to embrace both parts of themselves, light and dark. They talk about ‘bringing balance’ to the force, eradicating the dark side isn’t balance, that just tips the scales all the way to one side, the light. Embracing both sides of the force is the true key to balance and I don’t really understand how this hasn’t been touched on in canon (I haven’t read much legends, but I am aware of Grey Jedi and stuff)

Not really a point to this post, was watching Obi Wan whilst high and feel like I’ve solved everything even though this has probably been posted 1000 times before, good day Light side/Dark side"
starwars,"No, Star Wars was never the most mature media franchise, but now all it is about is basically fulfilling fan fiction.  Every episode of every series is now just ‘HEY I KNOW THAT CHARACTER!’ With them bringing back FUCKING EVERYONE FROM THE CLONE WARS.

The last thing that really challenged this was The Mandalorian season 1 which was freakin epic.  Season two is what started all of the fan service shit off.  

The last Jedi also comes to mind as being extremely original and story driven, rather than basically fulfilling fan fics for clone wars fanboys to swoon over and I don’t even dislike the clone wars.  

More mentally mature viewers who like stories and know film, especially ones that didn’t watch the clone wars (a kids show whether you’ll admit it or not) mostly liked The Last Jedi and I think it will be more liked in time rather than the easy slop we’re getting these days.  

The Kenobi finale falls into this this category too btw.  Though fun, it was not too engaging and drew obvious parallels to previous media for fans to go ‘he said that!’ and that’s it. POTENTIAL SPOILER: Star Wars is seemingly for younger audiences now."
starwars,"Dear r/StarWars,
Over the last several years the history of Star Wars has been… tumultuous to say the least. Fans were divided after Disney’s handling of the franchise, but I think we can all agree on one thing - R2D2: Beneath the Dome is a fabulous mockumentary with the most amazing actors ranging from Christopher Lee to Carrie Fisher, all in on this joke that R2D2 is an actor and chronicles his journey from birth in a small London town to present day of 2001. With Disney’s resurgence of the franchise, I think it’s time we get a part 2 and see how Reginald is doing. Can this happen, please? Reddit, I’d like your help."
starwars,"Of course, opinions will differ, I am curious though as I’ve seen many videos claiming both sides. Is Star Wars dying? Why or why not?"
starwars,"In the novelization of ANH based off the original script, the emperor is described as having been a distracted, ineffective person who let the various Moffs and Darth Vader take over. He’s named Palpatine, sure, but he’s not the dark lord of the Sith. Yes it’s a novel, but it’s published before ANH came out in theatres, and was around for years before Empire let alone Return of the Jedi introduced us to the much more interesting old necromancer.

So whenever we’re tempted to complain about retcons - and I admit I would personally like more consistency with the original trilogy in general, for lines like “I was but the learner” or “she died when I was very young” - there is precedent in Star Wars for some Retcons working out for the best.  



[Wikipedia of the book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_From_the_Adventures_of_Luke_Skywalker) Emperor Palpatine is (technically) a Retcon"
starwars,"I was very bored and I have an unhealthy amount of knowledge about the seven lightsaber combat forms, so I decided to put that to use and figure out which form I think Cal Kestis from Jedi: Fallen Order (and soon Jedi: Survivor) uses. I analyzed every single attack Cal can do – \[this youtube video\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z3cKv5-1FE) shows them all – and decided which form I think they each use. Then I came to a conclusion at the bottom of this post.  
Basic Attack/Combo (single blade): This seems to just be basic attacks. If I had to assign it to a form I’d go with Shii-Cho (Form 1). Shii-Cho focuses on basic blocks and parries, as well as four broad target zones: left side, right side, head, and legs. The basic attack appears to simply be targeting the left and right side of the target’s body. Cal also follows through with his strikes and they appear fluid and strong while also being basic, which is another characteristic of Shii-Cho. Pretty much every lightsaber duelist knows and to some extent uses these basic Shii-Cho attacks though.  
Basic Attack/Combo (double blade): Even though it looks simple just like the single blade one, I don’t think this is Shii-Cho for two reasons. First, its move are faster and don’t follow through like the single bladed moves do, and second I don’t think that a simplistic form like Shii-Cho would work well with a double-bladed lightsaber. Instead, I think that these attacks more closely resemble Niman (Form 6). Despite using a double-bladed lightsaber, no showy tricks are used and he mostly sticks to basic attacks. Also, Niman is most closely associated with Jar’Kai (dual wielding two lightsabers at once) and I think that might translate over to using a double-bladed one.  
Delay Thrust (single blade): This one I think is definitely Makashi (Form 2). Makashi heavily emphasizes moving forward and backward along a straight line, and jabs like that aimed to pierce an opponent with the blade’s point (a mark of contact known as “shiak”) have been stated by Dooku (the best known Makashi duelist in canon) to be the “sugnature move of a Makashi master).  
Delay Combo (double blade): I was kind of surprised when I watched this focusing on what form it would be, because honestly it looks like the same attack Maul uses in his duel against Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, which I thought would be Juyo (Form 7, a form that is forbidden for Jedi below the rank of Master). But then I realized that Maul also uses Niman, so I would assume it’s Niman that Cal is using here.  
Overhead Slash (single blade): This one’s fairly straightforward. It’s a move from Djem So (the melee variant of Form 5) called Falling Avalanche.  
Leaping Slash (single blade): I’d say that this is a combination of a little bit of Djem So and mostly Ataru (Form 4). It obviously has elements of the Falling Avalanche from Djem So, but he also spins around and jumps, kind of attacking from the air, which I think seems like Ataru. I think Cal blended the Falling Avalanche from Djem So and the move “jung su ma” from Ataru. Jung su ma is a rapid spin which is one of the three “su ma” moves, the foundation of Form 4.  
Whiwlwind Slash (double blade): I think that this is a combination of Shii-Cho and Niman. Niman for the same reason as the double-bladed basic attack/combo, and Shii-Cho because the fluid spin and follow through definitely makes me think of Shii-Cho. Although I think there could probably be an argument made for this being Ataru.  
Whiwlwind Throw (double blade): Same as the whirlwind slash, it’s pretty much the same thing just with a lightsaber throw added.  
Evasive Kick: This is really just a kick, so there’s not much to be said about it. If I had to assign a form to it though I think I’d have to say Djem So or Ataru. Djem So’s signature move is the fluid riposte, which redirect’s an opponent’s attack and then instantly counterattacks. But the mobility of this move leads me to think that Ataru is more likely than Djem So, and I don’t know if it can really be considered a fluid riposte if Cal’s blade never actually blocks the enemy’s blade. Also Ahsoka, a prominent Ataru user, frequently incorporated kicks into his fighting, so I think Ataru is my final verdict.  
Running Slash (single blade): The mobility of this attack and the fact that Cal jumps in the air and spins to do it means that I think it’s got to be Ataru, although just like the Leaping Slash it might have elements of Djem So.  
Running Slash (double blade): Ataru, same reason as the single blade Running Slash.  
Dash Strike (single blade): I’m gonna say Ataru for this one too.  
Dash Strike (double blade): Also Ataru.  
Jumping Slash (single blade): Also Ataru, he’s literally jumping into the air. Kind of seems like a Hawk-Bat Swoop to me  
Falling Slash (single blade): Ataru, this is fairly obvious.  
Parry &amp; Counter (single blade): This one could either be Ataru (some of the animations, particularly the one where he rolls over the enemy’s back, show Cal outmaneuvering the enemy to get a hit in) or Djem So (just the concept of this move sounds like Djem So’s fluid riposte), and because of the amount of different animations that can be used for it I think it’s safe to say that it’s sometimes one and sometimes the other.  
Switch Attack (single blade): Pretty safe to say that this is Niman. Since he’s using two lightsabers it’s pretty much Jar’Kai. Although since he never dual wields for extended periods, there is a chance he doesn’t know Jar’Kai and is just improvising with this move.  
Switch Attack (double blade): Same as the single bladed version.  
Lightsaber Throw: I don’t think throwing a lightsaber is really associated with a particular combat form, so I’m not gonna label this one.  
Lightsaber Deflection: The definition of Shien (the ranged variant of Form 5) is deflecting blaster bolts back at your opponent, so it has to be that. With that said though, it appears that users of pretty much every form have learned to deflect blaster bolts in this way.  
Force Pull: When he pulls an enemy and attacks them with his lightsaber, he’s using the Draw Closer move, which is one of the signatures of Niman.  
I’m skipping the rest of the Force powers because they can’t really be attributed with a form. I will say though that using the Force in conjunction with your lightsaber is usually associated with Niman.  
So my conclusion? I think that which form Cal uses depends on your play style and which attacks you use most often, but I think in general he uses a combination of Form 4 (Ataru) and Form 6 (Niman) which some elements of Form 5 (Shien/Djem So). I personally use what I think would be a more Niman-heavy playstyle, meaning that I rely on using the Force a lot to immobilize the enemies. An Ataru playstyle would have a lot of mobility and a lot of Running Slashes, Dash Strikes, etc.. And a Shien/Djem So playstyle would be using a lot of perfectly timed parries to stagger the enemy, and not moving around as much as the other forms. Cal Kestis Lightsaber Form"
starwars,"One thing that is really cool in RotJ is that when Luke meets force-ghost Kenobi, he greets him as ‘Obi-Wan’ for the first time. All other times up to then, he always called him ‘Ben’. Luke is now acknowledging Obi-Wan as a Jedi peer rather than an apprentice. 

In the last episode of OWK, Obi-Wan says bye with an insulting ‘Darth’, acknowledging Anakin as the Sith he has completely become. Saying names as acknowledgement"
starwars,Do we know who makes Vaders helmet? Is it mass produced by the empire? Does Vader have a special armorer? Do you think he has broken his helmet before innocuously? Is Vader's helmet custom built?
starwars,"I know this will never happen in a million years but I would absolutely die for a show similar to the style of GoT but set in the Star Wars universe. They could set it somewhere in the timeline between ROTS and ANH. One aspect they could focus on the political side of the actions of the empire. I’m sure there were plenty of senators that had problems with the genocide of an entire religion. They could show us the fall of the senate (senators betraying each other, Jedi sympathizing Senators being killed etc…) and how that worked and the aftermath of it. Show how brutal the empire are and make them truly scary and intimidating. Then as all of of this is unfolding we see the rise of the rebels as well. As things get worse and worse with the senate show Bail Organa begin forming the rebel alliance. Essentially it would be a violent gritty Star Wars story about the rise of both the empire and the rebels. It sounds pretty good in my head but im curious to hear what other people think A GoT style show but for Star Wars"
starwars,Do y’all feel like he was nerfed or was that just me? Darth Vader in the show
starwars,"Go after Luke? She wanted revenge on Vader but she learned he knew she was a youngling, so what did she have to gain by going after Luke? Why did Reva...."
starwars,"In my opinion, Count Dooku was the worst main villain in the entire mainline saga. He didn’t hold a candle to the intimidation of Darth Vader, he didn’t have the badassery of Maul, he didn’t have the fascination of General Grievous, and he didn’t have the overall villainy of Darth Sidious. He just comes out of no where in Episode 2 and gets killed off in the first 10 minutes of Episode 3. I think he can be simply fixed by introducing him in Episode 1 while keeping everything else the same so that the audience have an attachment to the character and his fall to the dark side.

We would first meet him in the Jedi council room in the Temple on Courascant when Anakin is being introduced to the council. Rather than it being Ki-Adi Mundi who questions Anakin alongside Mace Windu and Yoda, it will be Dooku. 

After the council room scene, we will have a scene in which Qui-Gon seeks counsel in his former master. This will establish their relationship as master and apprentice as well as establishing Dooku’s wisdom. He will be portrayed as kind and wise but still skeptical of his apprentice’s belief that Anakin is the chosen one. Ultimately, he will give his support to Qui-Gon.

We will last see Dooku at his padawan’s funeral. While the rest of the Jedi are accepting of his fate as they see this as what the force willed, Dooku will be angry at what the Jedi order has become due to both the entanglement with politics and the hubris/arrogance at the disbelief that the Sith could possibly have returned without them knowing. The last shot of Dooku will be of him leaving the funeral midway through, followed by a shot of Yoda sensing his own former padawan. 

I hope you like my version of TPM and I’d love any suggestions on how this could work better. Thanks for reading. Fixing Count Dooku"
starwars,My brother in law died unexpectedly and tragically at the age of 40 last week. We are planning his service and would like to honor him by quoting his favorite films. He loved the rebel alliance and Jedi. Are there any good quotes for this? Perhaps about death or moving on? My brother in law just passed we are looking for Star Wars quotes for his memorial service
starwars,How do I get the skywalker saga novelisations as I would be interested in looking deep into the thoughts of the chars novelisations
starwars,"Or cried watching a show/movie.

Long time Star Wars fan and I think of the franchise every day of my life. I know the lore better than most fans.

So anyway - the Kenobi finale: The fight with Vader was cool but disappointing until I realised there was a part two. My face lit up then. To be honest I forget most of the finale because there is one moment dominating the space in my mind right now. It was nice to see Alderaan looking pretty clean too. But after that, when Obi-Wan went to talk to Luke, then got back on his space horse/camel…and rode off into the distance…a blue entity started to manifest itself. I knew as soon as I saw the signature pony tail that my Jedi was back on the screen. I started welling up. A sense of joy unlike any I ever felt before manifested within me. As he turned around and started talking, it was bubbling up and I couldn’t do anything to stop it before I felt tears roll down my face. Qui-Gon Jinn was back in Star Wars, even if only for a few seconds.

Qui-Gon is my favourite Star Wars character ever and has been since I played the Lego Star Wars games as a kid. I didn’t know how to save the game so I always ended up playing level 1 all the time, so me and Qui-Gon became good buds :) he’s obviously the best part about Episode 1 and I was bummed he didn’t appear as a force ghost in 2 or especially 3, or any Star Wars movie again after. It was great when he appeared in TCW but that’s not live action…it wasn’t Liam’s figure (Neeson is my favourite actor too). I went to the opening midnight showing of TROS in 2019 and hearing my Jedi’s voice even for just a few seconds was a highlight of the film for me (it wasn’t hard to stand out in that film…).

I’d been hoping and excited for a Kenobi movie/series long before it was even announced as Obi-Wan is one of my favourites as well, and there was so much to explore between 3 &amp; 4. Amazing to see Ewan back in the role by the way. Vader was immense in this show as well too. But back to the show, I could only dream my Jedi would show up in it as Neeson was getting old (still love him and hope he makes LOTS more movies!) and it is Disney Star Wars…plus I saw him say in an interview that TV isn’t his thing when asked about a Kenobi cameo, and he’d be open to reprising the role if a movie was to come about, so I was kinda bummed. So you can imagine my surprise seeing my favourite actor and favourite character appear onscreen again when it was so unanticipated. It was just…too much for me I guess.

And yes I know it shouldn’t have been possible for him to manifest as a full force ghost but I don’t even care. I am a hardcore Star Wars fan and I don’t mind that they bent the lord a bit so I could see my favourite Jedi on the screen again. And Liam’s performance, short and all as it is, is brilliant. The lines of dialogue are just perfect for the scenario and it rounded out a show, where I’d have loved to see him, in the best way possible.

Thank you Disney Star Wars, you got this one right in my book The First Time In My Life I Cried Tears Of Joy"
starwars,"Just thought that would be a sweet reveal Should the Cal Kestis tv take place, the last episode should be a fight against an early Starkiller. And the kicker? Cal loses and his story ends"
starwars,"So I think obi wan just fixed a huge criticism about Luke in bob. So the biggest criticism I see is that Luke wouldn’t care about attachments but clearly he does because he send grogu back to mando. But, in the end of obi wan he says about Luke “he needs time to be a boy”. I know in the comics obi wan kept a journal that Luke eventually reads. If this idea of letting Luke be a boy and he’ll decide to be a Jedi when he’s ready was a profound enough idea for obi wan he may have written it in his journal and Luke may be taking that idea into his teaching. His giving grogu time to just be a kid and when grogu is ready to become a Jedi he will. I could just be reading to far into this but for me this totally fixes that little problem from BoBF. Book of boba fett nitpick fix"
starwars,"I was thinking about spice, it looks like heroin, the way the smuggling is done makes me feel like it’s the equivalent of a class A drug such as heroin or cocaine, but you never see anyone taking it, and I feel like the fact that it’s a drug is only ever implied through talks of it being illegal, through talks of smuggling it and morals and through selling people selling it. If it was actual heroin, I feel like the shows would all be rated as 18+, but is the reason it isn’t because it’s rarely, if ever, explicitly described as a illegal substance? Do Star Wars get away with showing Spice in a “kids” franchise because it being a drug is usually only ever implied."
starwars,"I know this might be a hot take since I usually see nothing but love and praise for any new Vader content we get, but personally I think Vader has been made to look incompetent and bad at his job overall in his various recent appearances. In this post I'm going to list all the different projects he's appeared in (that I've seen at least) and tell you my issues with how he is portrayed and the actions he takes.

\-------------- Spoilers for Kenobi --------------------

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Force Unleashed:

This isn't canon, but I'm going to count it because it's probably the one that portrays him the best in my opinion. He's scheming (based on his manipulation of Starkiller), the intro gives us a great feeling of his power, they tease his desire to overthrow the Emperor, and he overall seems like the powerful sith lord from the OT. Only at the end when Starkiller is comically overpowered do you even stand a chance against him.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Rebels:

I think Vader is pretty decent in this show. He doesn't stick around too long, and it does seem weird that he up and leaves the hunt for two jedi. He's portrayed to be very strong here also, absolutely dominating Kanan and Ezra and defeating Ahsoka after a fair fight. The portrayal of his Vader/Anakin split is also brilliantly done in my opinion. My main gripe is how all three jedi he fights manage to get away from him in one manner or another, to varying degrees of believability. 

Escaped jedi counter: 3

&amp;#x200B;

3. Rogue One:

Character wise he's done well. He has very little, but very effective screen time. Not the worst appearance, but as much as the hallway scene is cool, it seems ridiculous that he's unable to stop the rebels getting away with the plans. Especially with what we've seen in Kenobi, which is set years earlier, he should be able to tear right through and grab the plans far easier. Ultimately the hallway scene is cool if inappropriate for a character like Vader who should be hyper-competent.

Escaped jedi counter: 3

&amp;#x200B;

4. Jedi: Fallen Order:

This might be blasphemy, but I don't really like the Vader section in this game. Yes, the idea is clever, but the execution is kinda awkward in my opinion. Vader literally has you in his grip 4 feet away and he decides to... throw you for some reason. Then instead of seizing you he wastes his time shredding up the room and throwing shit at you. Then when he finally catches up to you he stands there taunting you and Cere when he should be capturing if not killing you both (and before people claim he likes to draw out his encounters with jedi, remember that he kills Obi-Wan off the bat in ANH). So he has cool factor here, but honestly this makes Vader look very bad at his role as a Jedi hunter.

Escaped jedi counter: 5

&amp;#x200B;

4.5: Clone Wars S7:

He's in one scene.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Kenobi:

This one is obviously the freshest, and is both the coolest and dumbest appearance of this character. I do love his extravagant use of the force, pulling down the ship and causing mini earthquakes. I also like how ruthless he is in this show. But my god, Vader is dumb as rocks here. The worst offender is him letting Obi-Wan escape in episode 3. He somehow can't put out fire he already just put out minutes ago, neither can he use the force to grab Obi or the droid (and that ""he likes the chase"" argument I mentioned earlier, which was used to defend this, doesn't apply based on the rest of the show). Then he lets Reva lead the ground assault on Kenobi for some reason, only showing up at the last minute. His fight with Reva is interesting, but the reveal that he always knew about her motives is stupid. Why keep her around then? Something something her rage is useful? All she did was fuck up the ground assault and let Kenobi go, it was hardly a big brain move to keep her in play as a tool (and no her idea to track Leia wasn't clever either, that was poor writing in the show). Then we have his final duel of the show with Obi, which was epic until he dropped a couple of rocks on Kenobi and called it a day. WHY would he not make sure the kill succeeded? Is he really that careless? Then he loses to Kenobi afterwards (which I don't like but that's an issue with the show overall, not his character), and they basically repeat the Twilight of the Apprentice Ahsoka moment, but with less impact. After the show, despite knowing that Leia was allied with Kenobi, he won't think to track down her or Bail to interrogate them. Why he doesn't do this is unknown, but it's a massive oversight and makes no sense at all.

Escaped jedi counter: 6

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, I think the writers of most of these projects were desperate to use this character but couldn't commit to realistically having such an overpowered character in the story without him winning, so they cop out an escape or win. Notice that I've included an ""escaped jedi"" counter to track the jedi he has fought and failed to kill. To my count it's 6. Now count how many jedi he's killed in these projects (excluding TFU). Has he even killed any? He executes Trilla I guess... not a very skilled jedi hunter is he?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know why you disagree. Hopefully I included enough positives that you know that I'm not a rampant hater of the character, I actually like him a lot. I just feel the character has been coasting off his rep as a ""fearsome Jedi-killing stoic monster"" but in practice the creators just seem to use flashy action scenes to cover up his inability to achieve things as a villain. Unpopular Opinion: Darth Vader Has Become Much Less Impressive Throughout His Post OT Appearances"
starwars,"Every story has a message, be it good or bad. So, what's the message behind Kenobi? What's the message?"
starwars,"I'm aware that, narratively, the Force is more of an analogy for what George Lucas describes as the difference between pleasure and joy, the Dark being pleasure and the Light being joy. Pleasure is quick to obtain, but always leaves you empty and wanting more, while the Light is something you build up for a long time and is wholly fulfilling.

But in the stories, as a system of magic, I've never really been able to wrap my head around the exact ""why"" the Sith are always evil and the Dark Side can't be used for good. The Dark Side is driven primarily by emotional expression and ambition, mainly things like fear and anger, but these aren't inherently evil emotions and we know drawing upon them, and therefore the Dark Side, and with temperance people like Luke Skywalker can tap into it and use it to great effect, like defeating Darth Vader in their rematch once provoked about Leia.

I understand the emotion trap, like how Anakin was covetous of Padme and sought Sidious for power to save her, but I've never understood why someone couldn't just walk up to a Sith and say ""Hey there, I would like to learn about your magic, please"" and walk away fine. In Legends we have Darth Vectivus, who was just a shrewd businessman and never really did anything evil, and from the films one could argue Dooku is less evil and more disillusioned with the Jedi Council and the Senate (though still not the best example, given him serving Mr. Sheevie Jeebies). Vapaad was a form of combat made by Mace Windu after studying the Dark Side, and even Luke Skywalker in both canons preaches a form of balance that guides his New Jedi Order, albeit Light-focused.

So I guess, what gives? If it's just a narrative thing that makes sense, but in practice it seems the Dark Side is less of a cosmic corruption trap and more a set of techniques that draw on things the Jedi frown upon. I don't understand the Force, especially the Dark Side."
starwars,Does anyone know what planet Obi-Wan and vader were fighting on in the finale? I can’t find anything What planet were they on?
starwars,"Can we get an R2-D2 show like Kenobi? They were somewhere all those years, and kept 3PO alive. R2 is one of the best hackers in the galaxy, and knows more secrets than anyone alive. It's a great setting for interplanetary intrigue. They just keep hooking up with various badasses for a mission or two, 3PO is there for comic relief, then gets reset every once in a while (sad droid noise). There are infinite possibilities for cool guest stars, random fan service, incorporating old cannon into new. At the same time it's low stakes enough to be ridiculous and fun. The next Disney+ show!"
starwars,"By now the common theory as to why Palpatine's face is deformed by the lightning in Episode 3 is that he was just wearing a mask which got burned away.

I'm just wondering is there anything suggesting that it was always intented that way when the movie came out? It just seems too obvious that the face itself got burned. And this is the only conclusion a movie-only watcher can make, since it is never explained otherwise.

On the other hand, Palpatine's eyes got yellow/orange in that scene and that's not really explainable by burning the face.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think? Did George Lucas always mean it like that or was it inconsistent writing that needed to be fixed by the Legends stories? Palpatine's Sith mask - Was it always intended that way?"
starwars,so i was rewatching A New Hope on Disney+ because i had nothing to do and noticed that the dialogues constantly switched between original and some sort of high quality remaster and worst part its not even consistent as it switches at random between quotes. is there any reason for this and a way to fix it? am i the only one to notice this?
starwars,"With the actors from the prequels and these Disney + shows. Easy stock boost and three guaranteed blockbusters, shooting the OT with updated effects and lightsaber  combat. At the end of the day the original sky walker tragedy is the life blood of star wars and they will continue running to that well. I'm around 60% sure Disney will announce they are remaking the OT in the next few years"
starwars,"I know this is a lengthy discussion, but there are some things i'd like to hear...

So many outright evil characters were forgiven in Star Wars. Darth Vader, Reva, to say some Force sensitives; and Imperial defectors like Iden Versio, and the pilot guy from Rogue One.

Inside the Star Wars universe, why are they forgiven, and not outright murdered/executed/tortured? Sometimes I feel like this is unrealistic - anyone living in 2022 would have them executed on sight to the very least.

I'm aware this has a Jedi explanation (and i'd love to hear more about it), but for those who are not Force-sensitives and still forgive or show mercy... Why does that happen? Forgiveness in Star Wars"
starwars,"My Top 5 (in no particular order) are Kit Fisto, Aayla Secura, Shaak Ti, Ahsoka Tano, and Plo Koon. Who are your favorite Jedi during the prequels/TCW?"
starwars,"Thank you so much for your input. After watching all the movies and the Disney plus series, I still havent seen any of the animated series. Is there an order I should follow?"
starwars,So I just rematch episodes 1 and 2 with the wife for the first time. What's the story with Padme being a wee bit of a cradle snatcher? Cradle snatching?
starwars,Recently in the Kenobi series. How do you guys feel about the duels. Is it just me or are the new lightsaber duels weird in light and heavy compared to the prequels?
starwars,"...and I love it for it. Complaints about Star Wars becoming ""political"" keep popping up with every new project announced, and while I hardly need to convince anyone here how redundant these statements are, it got me thinking: Star Wars is probably the mainstream media franchise most overt about its themes. George Lucas unapologetically shoves his beliefs down our throats in the 6 movies he created. His politics and ethics are absolutely essential to the story of Star Wars, so much so that he literally baked them into the metaphysics of the universe with the Force.

The light/dark dichotomy of the Force is a reflection of Lucas' morals. The light side of the Force is characterized by selflessness while the dark side is all about selfishness. To use the Force for selfish desires is to tap into the dark side, leading to corruption, leading to the influence of the dark side growing stronger. It's a spiral, the desire for power creates a stronger desire for even more power, hurting countless innocents in the process. In order to remain good, one must let go of all the things one fears to lose and become truly selfless. That doesn't mean being unable to love, but accepting that all things must end sometimes, and when that time comes, let go. George Lucas is telling us to not be selfish assholes.

And of course, the actual politics of Star Wars are super preachy too. The death of a democracy is an immense tragedy and the Prequel Trilogy presents it with such pathos, such grandiose drama, I can't help but awe every time I rewatch RotS. It's stuff like intercutting the fires of Mustafar, this apocalyptic imagery, with Palpatine physically disassembling the Senate in his duel with Yoda. You can just tell that Lucas absolutely **hates** what is happening, he's framing the fall of the republic alongside the end of the world, or hell, if you will. Then there's the end of AotC, where he plays the imperial march over the sweeping shot showing off the Clone Army. These are the good guys, but this army, this war, really represents the end of the Republic. It was over here and there, this war but a tool for Palpatine to grasp more power. It's through stuff like that you can also tell he just absolutely **hates** war. 

Lucas is aggressively telling us to cherish and protect our democracies, and I think these days, with so many people seemingly forgetting that liberty is not a given, it is of utmost importance that we keep showing these movies to younger generations, so they too, can see what Lucas was preaching about. Star Wars is incredibly preachy"
starwars,Would you just follow the Knights of the Old Republic plot or would you go a different route? If you were in charge of making a Star Wars TV series based on Revan how would you do it?
starwars,"Because it's not the fights in the OT. And this opinion has existed since before the ST and even The Clone Wars in some cases. So where does one find a ""good"" lightsaber fight? People who say the lightsaber fights in the prequels are bad: What exactly are you comparing them to?"
starwars,"Hey, so I hadn't seen the star wars films since I was a kid, and since my kid is 7 now, I figured I would start watching them with him. We've been watching in chronological order (not release order) we watched a new hope last Friday and will be watching the empire strikes back this Friday, and so on, on each Friday, he has loved them all so far, we've had a lot of fun watching them together. My question is, seeing as I am basically new to them too (in that I can't remember the rest of the films and have never seen the most recent releases) I'm wondering if I will spoil it for myself if I watch some of the series that are on Disney+ without him before we finish watching the films (I want to check how appropriate they are for the little guy as I've been told they're a little darker than the movies). And then also what order should I watch the series in? I really want to watch the Obi Wan Kenobi series because I love Ewan McGregor, but wonder if I should watch some of the others first? Or does it not really matter? order of watching?"
starwars,"&gt;!""Hello there.""!&lt;

Made me jump up and scream nasty things at the TV.  Scared my dog. I thought we were going to make it. I really did. We almost made it."
starwars,"Am I alone in thinking that the new prop lightsabers they use for filming look different (if not worse) than the ones they used in the OT/prequels? The “natural light” the new props give off seem overly colorful and exaggerated, reminiscent of glow sticks, lighting up the wielder’s entire body and everything in the room they’re in shades of bright red and blue— which, by my interpretation, is not how the light given off by an actual lightsaber is supposed to behave. A lightsaber is a contained beam of energy — more pale than colorful, that gives off some color in close quarters but doesn’t drape everything in color.


Moreover, there is a discernible difference in the way the actors handle them as opposed to the old props (presumably because they’re heavier).
Initially, I thought this was because Disney deliberately changed the style of lightsaber fighting in the sequels to resemble the clunky style of the OT, but even the fighting in Kenobi appeared considerably more clunky and labored than the prequels. By contrast, Vaders Rogue One lightsaber use (in which an OT style prop lightsaber was used) looked much more fluid and natural. What’s more, the lighting they added in in post looked very natural. So I frankly don’t see the need to use light up props in the first place.

Just my two cents. New lightsabers look worse?"
starwars,Im curious if there was any other weapons Jedi/Sith used? Perhaps a lightsaber the size of a dagger/knife or short sword? Are there such a thing as Lightdaggers?
starwars,I can’t wait for another Disney show about baby sitting and irrelevant side characters that completely steal the show from the character it’s supposed to be about 🙌 Disney is killing it 🤪🤪

starwars,"imagine 6 hour versions of a New Hope, Empire, and Return of the Jedi

i think it would interesting to see the things they could flesh out

and it wouldn't change anything from the OT, all the original lines and scenes would still be there

but instead of training Luke for what amounts to 6 minutes of screentime, we could see it for at least an episode 

downvote me your anger only fuels me Super unpopular opinion but honestly, what if they remade the OT as a series?"
starwars,"For example take Reva, she has some interesting traits but theres some other incredibly stupid stuff. Like how does she know that anakin is darth vader? And whenever someone hates on reva disney just hides away and calls people racists or whatever because people dont like the character. Disney doesnt know how to write interesting star wars characters. Change my mind."
starwars,"Full disclosure, I’ve never watched Rebels In it’s entirely. Are the Inquisitors all wiped out by A New Hope? Do they ever explain why the Inquisitors never showed up in the Original Trilogy?"

starwars,"Ages ago I saw a conspiracy theory about Star Wars and it was the most hilarious thing I've read, ever. However my google-fu fails me and I cannot find the post. Perhaps someone here knows it. If so please link it!

The theory was that the true motives for all characters in the original trilogy was to die before Lukes eyes and as such achieve ""jedi ghost body"" (force ghost).

One example were Obi-Wan putting up a fight against Darth Vader on the Death Star up until he sees that Luke is watching them, then he just gives in.

Another example was Yoda trying to dissuade Luke from leaving Dagobah because ""his training isn't finished"". But when he returns he is suddenly ""ready"" and Yoda dies before Lukes eyes.

Another example was Darth Vader after killing the emperor and Luke is dragging him to the ship. He asks Luke to remove his helmet so he can see him with his own eyes, and then dies before him.

I think there were further examples and the writing was hilarious. If anyone knows it and has a link please share it! [HELP] Looking for an old post about a Star Wars conspiracy theory"
starwars,"Hello ! I would like to watch all the behind the scenes, interviews, that were released on DVD releases of the movies, as well as The Clone Wars.

starwars,"Just finished obi wan kenobi. Imo a little rushed but last 2 episodes were great! The only gripe i have against the last 2 eps is the music. Its so generic, i mean you have so much star wars music to choose from, but end up with the most generic and forgettable score i can remember. I really dont understand it The music"
starwars,"For those who haven't seen the Ewok movies Charal was one of the sequel's villains who had Cindel’s family killed. Through a magic ring, Charal can turn into a raven but is a henchman for Terak. In the end, the ring breaks while Charal is still a raven, trapping her in that form forever. 

But considering that ""Star Wars"" (the original trilogy at least) carried themes on redemption (Han, Lando, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Darth ""Youngling-Killing-Planet-Destroying""Vader), the chance for Charal being redeemed shouldn't sound too far-fetched. The real question is what to do after the redemption?

Say that the redemption story happened shortly after ""Return Of The Jedi""; Luke would find a way to change her backing a human and maybe even offered her friendship and a part in his New Jedi Academy. Would Charal except the offers or decide to live in self-exile for all the murders she had took part in with Terak?

But, if she does except, would Leia and the others be willing to give her a chance? 

Then there's Cindel; she could end up being Leia's student in diplomacy or get a occupation that could her to meeting Luke and then Charal. Would Luke try to get Cindel to forgive the Witch or understand her feelings and not stress forgiveness so much?

And what about the rest of the galaxy; would Luke redeeming a witch lead to distrust from other planets? Especially if it's made public of Anakin being Darth Vader and Luke and Leia being his children?

What are your thoughts? Redemption For Charal *SPOILER WARNING*:"
starwars,So I have a question after watching the Kenobi series.. if Leia never knew that she was adopted until Luke told her why did she say that her mother died when she was very young (before Luke told her the truth). So she must to have been reffering to her adoptive mother right? And she's obviously alive when she's 10 years old on the series.. anybody got more info on this? the question about Leia and her mother..

starwars,"So I play a fallen jedi, turned sith apprentice of Count Dooku, in a SW5E campaign. It's set 5 years after Order 66, and my character turned to the darkside after being captured by separatist forces in the 2nd year of the Clone Wars. After Dooku's death, he kinda just went out on his own working as a bounty hunter for abit, wasn't anywhere near any conflict or clones when Order 66 was issued. Afterwards he just kinda layed low until the events of the campaign started. 


So, with him having abandoned the Jedi Order, and turning to the darkside, would the Empire/Inquistors hunt him down just like any other jedi or what they just not really care? I can't really find a canon answer to this. What do you think? Would Inquistors Hunt Down Fallen Jedi?"

Does he consider himself a wise leader bringing progress and prosperity to the galaxy or does he just like to see everyone suffer? Does he see the slavery of species like the wookies and expanding the military to keep everyone in line by force as a necessary evil? Why was the empire an authoritarian government?"

starwars,Can anyone tell me the actual length of the duel on mustafar? Not just what we see on screen which is 8-11 minutes long. Duel on Mustafar Length
starwars,"Most light saber users use slash’s over thrusts even if thrusts would be more efficient because lightsabers are nearly weightless and cut through anything. Basically they should be used as rapiers rather then short swords (since there one handed).

Qui gon was also left to bleed out for minutes before he died so if oni wan just force griped maul down the shaft he could have saved him once the barrier opened back up. 

All the dark Jedi/Sith who’ve been stabbed walked it off.

If young reva was indeed stabbed by Vader she could have tapped into the dark side to save her life like exar kun did in legends.

All the other people who been stabbed with a light saber where jobber Jedi and regular joes (Radom Padawan who got killed by yellow maul and that one guy ventress stabbed), could also be used for censorship reasons because they couldn’t show someone getting sliced in half on screen, same reason the jedi are never seen actually slicing people in half outside of the comics.

Meanwhile blaster shots are way more lethal since they don’t Cauterise (don’t know how you spell that) meaning you lose a lot more blood, there also are a lot wider and less precise then a saber stab. That’s way blaster shots to the chest always kill. 

Is this a rushed explanation absolutely probably got a lot of things wrong just wanted everyone to remember qui gon was on the floor for minutes before he died in obi wans arms. Kinda see lightsaber stabs being not really fatal as something that sort of makes sense."
starwars,"I’ve seen A New Hope I dunno, 500 times give or take, but it wasn’t until this last time that I was like ya know, I don’t think I’ve ever really understood what Obi-Wan says to Luke right after he wakes from his Sand People nap. I guess I always kinda heard it as some sort of old man wisdom about “a young man wastes…something, something….travel lightly”.  Never really processed it as a youngster I guess and after a while you’ve heard it so much it doesn’t even occur to you that what you think you hear doesn’t make sense, isn’t even a sentence, etc. It’s not exactly a critical piece of dialogue which is maybe another reason I never was compelled to get to the bottom of it. but after 40+ years I figured I’d sort it out.

Don’t get me wrong I still love them and they’ll always be special to me but I feel like it lacks emotional depth. 

For example when Luke finds his aunt and uncle who raised him burned to death he has no reaction whatsoever and moves on so quickly from it. Later when Obi Wan dies he seems upset about it when he knew him for a short period of time. I didn’t really mind things like these before but after Kenobi’s finale which was really emotional with some of the best acting in sw New Hope didn’t have the same affect on me. OT Trilogy"
starwars,Like come on….really? Disney is soft for putting disclaimers before the episodes.
starwars,"Like many, I was the victim of a 10-year Star Wars drought since the release of Episode III in 2005. Naturally I was going to enjoy anything they put in theaters for new Star Wars. I went to see TFA 7 times in theaters. I loved it. Now I realize it was out of pure nostalgia. That movie looked nice, but it set new Star Wars on a course for failure and it can all be tracked back to the lack of vision by the higher ups: Kennedy, Abrams, etc. 

Have you ever noticed the title ""The Force Awakens"" makes no sense for the film itself? Unless you consider OP Rey Awakens the real title. No for me, The Force Awakens was a title that gave me hope in the next generation of Star Wars.

The Force Awakens calls forth an idea that has still yet to be touched on in New Star Wars. I mean, why go forward when it's so easy to back and ruin old characters with moneygrab shows?

With the empire gone and the jedi order eradicated that leaves one simple fact....Force Sensitive people are AWAKENING without any proper way to identify them and educate them. This should've been the focus of the new trilogy. Not the fIrST oRdEr, but Luke Skywalker's quest to help a galaxy cope with Force Sensitive people running amok bc they don't know what they are. If unchecked would they naturally fall to the darkside? Could a new Sith lord prey upon this notion? This premise alone opens the doors to all sorts of new worlds and characters.

To be frank, I thought this is where the new trilogy was headed. Once the drought was over and we became over-saturated with new Star Wars content it became clear the future of Star Wars is to dwell in the past. It's sad to say but this has really started to sour me on Star Wars culminating with the mishandling of Obi-Wan. 

We've now entered into the age of high-production value fan fiction Star Wars and its cheapened the characters and stories we grew up with that came directly from the creator's (GL's) head.

TL:DR Disney is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars. Force Awakens is a better title than movie. I'm still waiting for the force to awaken throughout the galaxy. Almost 7 years later and the Force Awakens fails to be the finger on the pulse SW rebirth everyone was hoping for and here's why"

Series like the Mandalorian, the Book of Boba Fett and Ashoka should be considered the sequels.

And for people telling me to stick with it because it gets better later on, no, I’ve watched animes like that and sure it gets better but those awful first few seasons just drag those shows down from good to meh.

starwars,As an additional bonus Ani gets to keep an entire atmosphere between himself and any errant sand particulates. It's a no brainer.

starwars,"At first we’re supposed to think she’s an inquisitor and fully on the dark side, but then she seems comically bad in that role. And *then* it seems like she’s actually not darksided and really just wanted revenge on Vader the whole time. But then, after he defeats her and leaves her for dead, she…decides to reenact what Vader did to her youngling friends and kill Luke? For some reason? But of course then has a change of heart. At which point it seems less like she was secretly good and more like confused and conflicted the whole time. Which, if that’s the way they want to go, fine! But it’s communicated so poorly that she just seems opaque and incoherent. Moses Ingram is a great actress, so honestly I think she was just a victim of bad writing here, and maybe bad directing, too.

Especially one called how liberty dies which explores the politics of Star Wars and pretty much goes through the entire political side of the show. But despite knowing all that I have still found the show to be entertaining and fun. I like how the separatists are made to be more of a threat in season two rather than bumbling idiots like they were in season one, I also like how battles are depicted in the show and I like the animation. Looking forward to a fun ride till the tears that will come with season seven. Watching clone wars for the first time (currently at the end of season 2)"

That position appears to have already been filled. Given the time frame of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rebels, and A New Hope there isn't much time for Galen to be found by Vader, raised and taught to use the dark side, and then spend years hunting down Jedi before his redemption story begins. The idea of Galen existing as a secret apprentice while the Inquisitors already have the same exact purpose as him is hard to swallow. Perhaps he could be written in as one of the Inquisitors we have yet to meet? But then he wouldn't be truly Starkiller, he would just be another Inquisitor who happens to look like him. What do you guys think? How would you feel about reintroducing Starkiller AKA Galen Marek AKA Vader's Apprentice to canon?"
starwars,"I was just thinking what happens or has happened to people who have come back to the light from the dark side? Do they face a trial? Do they get punished? Anakin slaughtered children for example, if he survived would he face trial?

Are there examples in lore of what happens? What happens to people on the dark side who redeem themselves?"
starwars,"I mean the name alone. but the ending of obi wan. theres so many parralels. I havent seen any theories about this, what do people think??, Just a theory. But anyone else think Reva is about to become a Revan equivalent?"
starwars,"While I love The Mandalorian, I think the success of Mando caused Disney to get too greedy and go WAY overboard with the amount of Disney Plus shows they put out.

I like Rogue One, but why do we need a Cassian Andor show? He's not a popular character, he's not iconic, and the show is about the incredibly overdone Rebels vs. Empire conflict. Even if the show is good, it will inevitably feel stale.

The Skeleton Crew show that comes out next year sounds completely unnecessary. It has been described as ""Stranger Things meets Star Wars"" which means Disney are probably just trying to copy Stranger Things because of its success.

I could go on and on. There's the Lando show, and the Rangers show (that only got canned because of Gina Carano.) Now there are strong rumours of a Reva show... a spin off of a spin off, featuring a character who was just introduced and isn't notably popular. There's also rumours of a Darth Maul show and even a Cal Kestis show.

IMO, Disney should cut down to a max of two live-action Star Wars shows per year. I think the current rapid output is causing the quality to suffer. Do you think Disney are milking Star Wars too much with all of these Disney+ spin off shows?"
starwars,"Okay, so, straight to point I guess:  
I'm looking to start reading some Star Wars stuff, but I have absolutely NO idea, where to even being looking. I've watched the movies and spin offs - not the animated series though. I love the universe and the lore behind some of the characters.

I usually like to start from ""the beginning"", but I don't know, if that's the right way to go here.

So what can you recommend?

\--  
I posted this in r/StarWarsEU as well. What to read?"
starwars,"So Prequels, spinoffs and stuff like that are having the power to give the original content more meaning  by adding subtext. After the obi wan kenobi series the legendary quote ""No, I am your father"" has a new subtext too. In Kenobi Vader tells obi wan that he has killed Anakin, so he thinks of himself as a new person.
That means that Ben was right when he told Luke, that Vader killed his father. So when Vader tells Luke, that he didn't killed his father, because he is Luke's father, it doesn't contradicts with his statement in kenobi, it's more of admission that he has turned back to Anakin, struggling with the fight between light and dark. Also it's a foreshadowing for his deeds in Episode VI. ""I am your father"" is now more meaningful then ever"
starwars,"Hello guys, ive never seen starwars before and me and my girlfriend want to watch them. Which is the correct order for us to watch them? (according to release date i guess)

Thanks :D Being new to starwars"
starwars,In my opinion the only excellent Disney Star Wars piece that fit in perfectly with everything else and had the spirit of what Lucas intended was the finale of the clone wars.  Some rebels scenes were pretty good too like vader VS Ahsoka and  rogue one was good. Other then that it does feel that Disney Star Wars is mediocre. Thoughts? The only excellent Disney Star Wars piece
starwars,"Although I thought that ending was pretty perfect, a season 2 with Kenobi reconnecting with Qui Gon and more Vader and Palpatine moments would be amazing. And if they really wanted to go full Mando Season 2 they could even have Cal and potentially Maul return. Perhaps some more flashbacks as Obi Wan becomes more attuned with the force. I really hope we get more of this timeline and these characters. *EP 6 SPOILERS* Damn that episode was great, fingers crossed for a season 2."
starwars,"First off don't get it twisted, I got a VHS box set of the OT when I was 7, and TPM came out when I was 9. I love Star Wars, I really do.


But Star Wars really needs to step away from the characters we know and love in favor of new ones. The best example I have is Mando vs everything else TV wise. I enjoyed Kenobi even if it had it's weak points, and it was much better than BoBF, but despite the cool interactions between Obi and Anakin/Vader, Obi and Leia, heck just about every major/minor player in the show, you can never really escape the knowledge of the ultimate fate of these characters, the stakes just aren't there. That's what I believe mando enjoys the benefit of, being a new character along with baby Yoda. The stakes are there, the mystery of both characters, the interest in their back stories are there, the growth of those characters are ever present (Not to take away the growth of Ben/Obi as a character in this show). It really makes for better stories/TV to have fresh stories and characters imo. It's definitely the direction we're moving in but I hope it comes sooner rather than later. Star Wars needs to move away from content surrounding the OT characters."
starwars,"Why did the Obi-Wan decide to keep the children (Luke and Leia) a secret  
We all saw how Vader changed upon learning that Luke is his son, so what if this was informed to him earlier, would he have changed the same way if he did Why?"
starwars,"Is there any specific order I should watch them? Anything I should know beforehand? etc. Hello, I’m interested in watching Star Wars, I haven’t seen any of the movies yet also know very little about it - How should I go about doing so?"
starwars,"Ya’ll, can we stop with this thinking that Star Wars can only exist in two extremes?

It seems that any time a nee Star Wars thing is kinda decent its considered the best thing ever created. Vice versa, whenever something js somewhat mediocre, its condemned as the worst thing in existence.

There’s no middle ground here even though I think that’s where a lot of the content of this franchise falls into, and for me personally, that’s where the Obi-Wan show fell into. 

I thought it was an average show where everything with Obi-Wan and Vader was great and there were some fun action setpieces that suffers from some truly baffling directorial and writing decisions.

Nuanced opinions like that just don’t seem to be allowed for whatever reason and I think that’s one of the many things that turns people off from discussing this franchise in my honest opinion. We need to stop dealing in absolutes"
starwars,I have a simple and complicated question at the same time. Why people don't like  the obi-wan serie?  I don't want to create debates or make a problem it's just a question. I have a simple yet hard question.
starwars,"In Clone Wars Anakin and Obiwan discover the preindustrial Talz species, by the time of A New Hope there is at least one chilling in Mos Eisley. 

Damn. The Talz went from stone age hunter gatherers to space faring and chilling in the Cantina in the span of like 20ish years wtf?"
starwars,"Disclaimer:

Apologies in advance, I didn't really know how to word the title correctly. Anyway, it's been a few years and I want to watch through the entire franchise, granted, condensed.


By this I mean every theatrical release, the Disney+ shows, the popular animated stuff, et cetera. All in chronological order because I think it makes more sense when doing the entire conglomerate. 


That out of the way...

How do I organize the prequels in regards to The Clone Wars (the animated series), the prequels, and The Bad Batch? I don't really fancy spending 100+ hours binging different shows and I'm aware the series is organized nonlinear.

Which arcs and important episodes do I watch and which order do I watch them? Stuff that gives closure, important exposition, context, and stuff that means something outside of just the series itself.



Tl;dr - How do I organize watching the prequel trilogy and a condensed version of The Clone Wars simultaneously? How do you do a Condensed Viewing of The Clone Wars?"
starwars,Darth Vader fans about to be kinda mad with the last episode I just can feel it especially toxic ones after Vader got fucking shit on by Obi God Kenobi Obi Wan Season Finale
starwars,"Everytime Star Wars disappointed fans in recent years it was ""Disney did this"" or ""Disney needs to stop that"" as if Lucasfilm doesn't make the majority of the writing and narrative decisions, as well as hire the directors and writers in the first place

Everyone praised Facreu for Mandalorian, but then blamed Diseny for the shortcomings on Book of Boba Fett despite Favreu leading both projects 

When Marvel makes a lackluster film nobody tries to blame Disney for it

It's not like Mickey Mouse is standing over Favreu and Filoni telling them to make rewrites, that's the board of Lucasfilm and the producers Why does every try to lay all the blame on Disney instead of Lucasfilm?"

starwars,What do you all think? legit? I personally love the game and wouldn't mind seeing a live action show about Cal. Cal Kestis Rumored to get his own show on Disney+
starwars,A few weeks ago the YouTuber Solar Sands made a video on battle droids and how they’re mistreated. One of his arguments were why the separatists would design robots that develop sentience and could feel fear and refuse orders. About 50% of the comments were just explaining how he’s wrong because there’s a explanation for it in canon. Even if a canon explanation exists that does not make the writing immune to criticism and does not “fix” the flawed logic of the universe. Yeah droids are made to follow their programming and develop personalities through experience. That does not make his criticism of WHY an army would be designed like that wrong and doesn’t excuse what I see as poor world building. Just because something is “canon” doesn’t mean it makes logical sense from a writing perspective and doesn’t make it a good explanation.
starwars,"I’m so hyped for this movie, but there’s been…..nothing. It’s slated for a 2023 release yet we don’t even have a named cast yet. At least not on IMDB.

Has there been any recent news? Has anyone heard anything about Rogue Squadron?"
starwars,"Couple drinks in and I’m thinking, how would’ve things turned out if Darth Vader killed Sidious earlier and became the master? How would that play out? Would it get worse? Better? Random thought."
starwars,None. My prediction for the Kenobi finale.
starwars,"Hey y’all, Ive recently gotten into Star Wars and watched the CW, all the movies and the the recent series’s. I wanted to get into some books/comics and I would like to find out more about Luke’s training and his life post Endor. If y’all could recommend a starting point I’d really appreciate it! Book/comics timeline?"
starwars,"Funny I know. I don’t watch Star Wars, but was always interested in him and his purple lightsaber. Also being the only black character I recall seeing. Who would he be in the world of naruto and why, so I can get a grasp on what his characters power/personality is supposed to be. What is mace windus importance in the story, in naruto terms?"
starwars,"Everyone’s been doing it so I’m gonna drop mine. T minus 1 hour and 30 minutes till it drops so I’m not too late

Prediction #1 (my favorite): A duel between Darth Vader and Obi Wan, however, it’s different. Last episode was just a hint that Obi Wan still knows how to best Anakin. The duel is gonna be Obi Wan on the defensive the whole time, dropping witty remarks. This will be a cover for people to escape, and right before Obi Wan leaves he’ll say something along the lines of “you’re still the apprentice Anakin” to remind him he’s still number 2, he can still be be beaten and has a lot to learn. 

This ties together why he says “when I left you I was but the learner now I am the master” in episode 4 when he’s stronger and ready to kill the emperor and rule the galaxy with Luke (once he finds out he exists) as his apprentice.

Prediction #2: The Rebellion shows up. Something along the lines of saving the day whilst the Vader Obi Wan duel is going on. We forget this takes place only 10 years before ANH, the rebellion is still a thing and there’s still a war going on between them and the empire. We also saw a rebellion helmet from the pilot Reva killed, that was just a hint.

Prediction #3: You guessed it, Qui Gon appearance. Whether as a voice or actually there, he gonna be there. 

Prediction #4 (bold one): Some sort of early on Clone Wars flashback with Anakin, Obi Wan, and young Ahsoka.

Prediction #5: I saw someone else post this, and I agree, Owen’s gonna kill Reva then prolly make some witty comment to Obi Wan. Kenobi Episode 6 Predictions"
starwars,"I heard the show television series was great. I have no knowledge of star wars though (yes im part of the one percent that has never seen a star wars movie before). If its not standalone, what stuff do i need to watch before star wars the clone wars? Can i watch star wars the clone wars without any knowledge of star wars?"
starwars,Or really any other way in which I would be able to type Aurebesh into Discord as my name Has anyone created unicode symbols for the Aurebesh/Alphabet yet?
starwars,"One of the most ill-received additions from the prequels has to be the midi-chlorians, those little bacteria that give you access to the force (someone's gotta do it). I get why people don't like them, and it's a bit more scientific than just an invisible presence that binds the galaxy together. HOWEVER, after watching Kenobi and hearing his explanation for what the force feels like...it clicked with me that the force is still the presence so eloquently described in A New Hope, and the Jedi truly believe that it is as described by Ben. Qui-Gon chooses to see the Force at its scientific level because he no longer is disillusioned by the egotistical nature of the Jedi Order. Instead, he prefers to side with the solid evidence of what creates the force at its core (or at least what is considered to be the source of power) instead of the overall concept. Even though Obi-Wan reads the results of Anakin's midi-chlorian count to Qui-Gon, it's merely superficial for him. By Episode II, he's solely pushing the force as a greater power, not something quantified by lab results. So, actually, midi-chlorians are perfectly acceptable for Star Wars, and clearly demonstrates the divide between the height of the Jedi and the beginning of their downfall on a scientific level. Defending Midi-chlorians!?"
starwars,"As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized I’m not as in love with the Star Wars movies (1-6) as I was when I was younger. The sequels look great visually but the story is just wild and kinda ridiculous. I adore the video games, TV shows, and expanded universe and lore. But the movies are a bit too cheesy. I do realize they are made for kids and that’s when I was obsessed with them. But I’m even losing the nostalgia magic for them. Does anyone feel this same way? I was born in 98’ and grew up with the prequels mostly and was always a big fan of the original trilogy as well. The original Star Wars Battlefront 1&amp;2, Knights of the Old Republic, and Force Unleashed are some of my favorite games when I was younger and I still love all of those. The movies have just gotten a bit dry for me. Does anyone else feel this way or am I just weird? Not trying to be controversial. It’s just how I’ve been feeling lately reconnecting to these films with my 5yr old son. We have been playing OG battlefront together though and that has been a blast! I enjoy the expanded Star Wars universe but have lost interest in the movies."
starwars,"It's something I've noticed since the Sequel Trilogy &gt;!that carried forward into Luke's appearance in The Mandalorian and then again in Kenobi.!&lt; The lightsabers are starting to feel a little more solid, like sticks, and I'm not one-hundred percent sure why. 

**Is this something you're noticing as well?**

&amp;#x200B;

The technology is obviously improving, and I wonder if that's what's doing it. Perhaps, because the light glows a little more realistically and the effects are more consistent between each shot, the blade has begun to feel a little more defined, less fantasy-like and more of a solid object. 

It's no big deal. The lightsabers always changed in every major saga movie before the sequel trilogy (E.g. the blades got thicker in the prequels; Maul's was orange at times; Anakin's was dark blue later in the trilogy, etc.) and that might contribute to this feeling I'm getting now that they're all very consistent after The Force Awakens, but I'm not sure I want them to suddenly all feel exactly the same *all the time*.

&amp;#x200B;

What I miss is that bright core, the white light down the centre of the blade with that gradual blurry glow into whichever colour around the core. I miss the teeter, the sort of wavering flicker (almost like a campfire or candle) or visual vibrations they had like real light that was being bound into a blade but always on the verge of breaking out, maintained within a barely-stable field. The flicker is still there, but its so subtle now; the shape never quite changes like it used to, and the colour around the blade extends so far around the environment that it lacks that vibrant blur of blue, green or red that normally wraps tightly around the white.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Am I making any sense here?

Maybe I'll link some images to compare:

[A New Hope](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/92/Lukesaberanh.png/revision/latest?cb=20130228054320) compared with [The Last Jedi](https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ep8-ff-006225_8c6a1dd3.jpeg)

[Return of the Jedi](https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/luke-skywalker-lightsaber-1536x864.jpg) compared with [Rise of Skywalker](http://www.scififantasynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rey-yellow-lightsaber.jpg)

[Revenge of the Sith](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFPT85uiW3q48b3a5BaiFJ.jpg) compared with [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b637c76e17ba3724ec64dcb/1b303651-1553-4692-9eb4-c764f0c79aac/star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-episode-3-duel2.jpg?format=1000w)

In each comparison, the modern version has its light react more like we'd expect it to in real life, but it loses that brightness at its core and the typical wrap of vibrant colour around the blade that we're traditionally used to.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise this is such a minuscule thing, but it's an observation I made early on and I always seem to notice and feel it. It's a non-issue, to be sure, but it does distract me from the stories I'm otherwise quite enjoying. &gt;!I love seeing Luke, Obi-Wan and Vader again.!&lt; I'm eager as heckle to see what becomes of the new characters we are being introduced to. But I am a bit distracted whenever there is a lightsaber on-screen, and I kind of hope it's addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you feel the same? Am I just crazy? What do you think has caused this? Do you prefer any particular design or special effect from across the films and television series over any other?** 

What's your favourite lightsaber effect? Which film or series best represented lightsabers for you? Would you prefer any specific effect to be the standard? How might you change the current lightsaber visuals (if at all)?

*Bonus question: What's your favourite lightsaber colour? Who's lightsaber has your favourite hilt?*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!\*\*Interestingly enough, the Darksaber and Ahsoka's white blades are completely fine due to their uniqueness. !&lt; Discussion: Does anyone else feel that lightsabers are starting to look too solid in recent Star Wars media? (with comparison pictures)"
starwars,"Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, or Purple? For me yellow would be a cool pick but Rey kind of ruined that so I’m going with the classic Blue What would you pick as your lightsaber color?"
starwars,"Alright so the title pretty much explains it. I have to be up by 6:30 to go to work but I really wanna watch it when I comes out so I won’t have it spoiled for me. Should I stay up until 3 am? Or should I wait until I’m off of work which is 3 pm. Or, should I wake up really early and watch it before work? Not really sure which one to do. Kenobi finale dilemma"
starwars,i thought at that point obi wan wasnt his master but palpatine why did anakin say 'it is the end for you my master'?
starwars,"Luke: I think Sebastian Stan is the obvious pick but I think the guy that they use that’s not Mark Hamill is also great

Han: I think Charlie Cox could do a great job with this character. He seems like the perfect choice

Leia: I don’t know if she’s great but she’s all I could think of. I thought of Natalia Dyer for this role

Lando: I have no idea for this one. This is the one character I have no one for If Disney wanted to use all main original trilogy characters in the Mando/Boba Fett/Ahsoka time period but didn’t want to use cgi, who should play them? I think the Solo characters should also be recast because it’s been over a decade in universe except for Chewbacca because of the suit."

starwars,"I liked the book of boba fett, but personally I don’t think it was about boba fett that much, and more about the mandolorian. It was still great and boba and jango are probably my 2 favorite characters, but I just felt bothered by this. I don’t know if you guys think this but…"
starwars,"I’ve been watching Star Wars in chronological movie by rewatching the movies and mandalorian and boba fett, but also watching many episodes of the cartoons shows for the first time. I got through Clone wars and rebels by using guides of important episodes to watch and which look the most interesting (since there are too many), but Star Wars resistance doesn’t look very interesting to me. While I could enjoy supplemental Star Wars material, it doesn’t seem like I could watch certain episodes and it would matter to my overall Star Wars reviewing. Should I at least watch some episodes of Star Wars Resistence, or is it fine to just skip? SW Resistance worth watching?"
starwars,I wanna get into starwars and I have no idea where to start watching. Do I start with the movies? Or the shows idk where do I start?
starwars,"It blows my mind how badly TLJ completely derailed what TFA was building. I loved tfa, I think it’s a great movie and was a great reboot back into the saga. Rey was being teased as a kenobi which would’ve been awesome and made sense. I don’t see her as a Mary sue. Never have. It actually makes complete sense a orphan female would know how to fight and fend for herself. Kylo is a g. Best part of the sequels. I think if JJ directed all 3 we would’ve had such a different movie. I still think kylo would’ve turned good. Kinda his arch I feel. But yeah. Tell me how y’all felt about it Sequels"

starwars,"We all know how impractical the AT-AT is, and the *Imperial*\-class Star Destroyers sure could have been better. The Millenium Falcon is too classic to change, but let's be real- that side cockpit is hella bad. What vehicle in Star Wars would you change? Which Star Wars vehicle would you redesign, and why?"
starwars,"The Clone Wars are the events that happen directly after Attack of the Clones and at the end, run parallel to Revenge of the Sith, then immediately after is the Bad Batch.

I'm watching Clone Wars and its really good, following that link that was given to me that shows the episodes in chronological order makes this series a lot easier to follow.  I have a good grasp so far but while watching these episodes, something crosses my mind:

Like imagine all of the events of the Clone Wars and erase them from the timeline, how much impact do the Clone Wars have on the timeline? Like if it was erased from the timeline, what would be missing? What impacts wouldnt have happend? How much impact does the Clone Wars series have on the entire lore?"
starwars,"Just like how obi wan series was suppose to be a movie but it turned into a series JUST for content for Disney plus.  So would you rather have a huge box office budget movie, the hype, theatrical experience based on Vader . Or would you have a 6 series episode on Disney plus? I personally would have a movie. I feel like they turned obi wan into a series for greed and content for their pay based platform (which they probably make more from subscriptions) Darth Vader Movie or Disney series?"
starwars,I personally loved Starkiller/Galen Marek. I believe he represented an unrestricted perception of a force wielded and had an incredible arc since his conception. If there were an opportunity to bring him into canon(which I don’t think he should’ve been done away with anyway) how would you like to see his character done? How about we go a step further and actually theorize how this COULD be done? How could/would Starkiller work in canon?
starwars,Every time I watch them I’m so critical of how poorly the script and story was planned. There’s so many holes in the plot and it makes me so angry. I have so many issues with the newest trilogy
starwars,"I’m rewatching the sequel trilogy, and damn it had so much potential. I think the force awakens was decent. The opening scene of the last Jedi was great with the star ship fight. Then it’s immediately undercut with them making an ass out Luke which is like a sin of biblical proportions in Star Wars. Idk we’ll see how it all sits with me after this rewatch. The sequel trilogy"
starwars,"I want to get the maximum impact of episode 6.  Help me O Binge Watch Kenobi.  

In TPM, Tiny Anakin says:  ""No one can kill a Jedi.""  Owch.  

What stands out the most watching on a big TV is that it was a sad waste of eyeball resolving capacity every time I watched them on a laptop.  For some reason the prequels don't seem silly to me now.  Maybe it's the immersiveness of a bigger screen, and maybe it's having a better understanding these days of Palpatine's maneuverings.   Watching react vids of younger people helped a lot.

Pausing during any shot is a feast for the eyes, especially the establishing shots, but most especially in the middle of a wipe.  Some of those are hilarious.  

Anakin and Padme's love scenes always felt off.  This time around it seems like it's because Padme's seeing what she wants to see, and Anakin's affect is weird and disturbing, like his ""love"" is greedy possessiveness.  Padme's most ironic line is when she says jokingly, ""So love has blinded you?""  Again, owch.  But omg the scenery on Naboo.  

Portman will have Thor powers soon, and then we'll see who shoots lightning.  

The creatures doing synchronized swimming in spherical ponds appears to be straight out of ""The Smoke Ring"" by Larry Niven.  That book has a weird gas torus around a neutron star that happens to support life in freefall.  The ponds are spherical and have alien fish.  People go swimming in them, and use tethers to pull themselves out.  

Why is Kenobi so lazy about door controls?  How hard is it to push a button?  

Why are there no moose on Moostafar?  Vader's lodge should at least have a moose head.  

In TROS, R2 has a backup copy of 3-PO's memories.  Does that mean he keeps a copy of the older memories, from when Threeps had no skin and was not sure the ground was entirely stable?  

In ANH, when the Imps learn who the droids were sold to on Tattoine, did they report it to Vader?  ""You're saying Owen.  Freaking.  Lars.  Bought those robots?""  

These and other questions are ones to which we do not need serious answers.  

Yoda murdering two red guards by waving his hand is funnier than all the gags in Spaceballs put together.  Palpatine landing with his butt in the air is almost as funny.  

Obi Wan took the high ground on Mustafar because he was mindful of his surroundings and was the first to spot the opportunity.  All Anakin saw was Obi Wan.  

Anakin said that the Jedi were evil, but his arguments didn't have a leg to stand on. 

If you watch ROTS too close to ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" it's WAY too many women dying in childbirth. 

Vader's ""Noooooooopers"" scene was cut before he could finish the word.  

Yoda:  ""Your old master has returned from the netherworld of the Force.  A particular set of skills I will teach you.""  

If Maul had been more like an 80s action hero, right before he stabbed Qui Gon Jinn he would have said, ""I'm going to burn you a new belly button.""  

In TPM, if Palpatine/Sidious/Trade Federation's invasion had succeeded in wiping out the Naboolian people, including the Gungans, what would have become of the Naboo senate seat occupied by Palpatine? Re-watching the prequels and episodes 1-5 of Obi Wan is making me love the preqs (stupid observations plus puns)"
starwars,"In the end of ROTS the separatist leaders don’t seem to be fazed at all by the abrupt end of the war with no explanation. Did they offer surrender, or was it a stalemate? Did they decide to make peace or did sidious do it for them/force them? Did they just think the war was lost because of the loss of Dooku and Grevious and terrotorial losses plus the defeat at Coruscant? How did the separatist leaders feel about the end of the war? And what exactly were the terms of peace?"

starwars,I am a big fan of both franchises but SW always has hit me differently with my feelings and lore/character-wise. Atm I have slacked on some MCU stuff compared to counting the days off to new SW content and even rewatching it. How do you guys feel? Am I the only feeling SW is becoming more populair then Marvel again?
starwars,"Seeing Vader rip apart that ship, then fight the Third Sister was amazing Say what you want about Obi-Wan Kenobi"
starwars,"I think I understand why people say star wars needs to be more conservative with fan service, but I don't think that is a problem. I think that the opposite of fan service is making Han a deadbeat, Leia a failed revolutionary, and Luke a guy who can think murder is the the right thing to do (of his nephew even). I think the opposite of fan service is having the three of them never get together in the same room to do anything. I don't feel particularly serviced as a fan, and I suppose that if it weren't the case that I would be a satisfied fan by definition of the term ""fan service"". The general star wars fan looked calm and content during TFA by my estimate, but not so much by the time TLJ was viewed and it has been a bit shaky ever since then and some would say there is not enough fan service in the world to make them like star wars again. What is fan service?"
starwars,Personally I am in favor of the idea of removing the sequels from canon since it could fix many plot holes that break the storyline of the prequels and ot. Opinions on removing the sequels from canon?
starwars,"There is so much I love about this series. 

Mostly, I think, it’s spending more time with a character I absolutely idolized in those prime, middle-school years. But, and maybe this is because (like Ben in the first episodes) I’ve aged into a stony adult, I expect more from stories than nostalgia and spectacle. They need stakes, characters need clear motivation, and plotlines shouldn’t feel convoluted. But, again, there are so many pieces I love.  

That’s why I can’t help but imagine it differently (which, basically turned into fan fiction). 

CHAPTER ONE

The flashback to Order 66 in the Jedi Temple is the same. 

On TATOOINE, OBI-WAN wakes from a terrible dream. He has closed himself off from the force, a shadow of his former self. He does check in on young LUKE, but he is not concerned about his training. His survivor’s guilt has caused him to truly turn his back on the Jedi and their ways. 

REVA and THE INQUISITORS arrive in Mos Eisley to hunt down a FUGITIVE JEDI. Her tactics are brutal, as are the other inquisitors. The THIRD BROTHER only asks them to tread carefully. They need him alive to gather crucial intelligence, a direct order from DARTH VADER at the behest of THE EMPEROR.

On ALDERAAN, we’re still introduced to young LEIA. The beats from her role in the first episode remain largely the same, except we see some more overt hints that she’s strong with the force. We still see that BAIL ORGANA is attempting to play both sides and remains a man of influence. However, the kidnapping plot is not connected to Reva in any way. The perpetrators are discharged CLONE TROOPERS, and they’re capturing Leia—the daughter of a senator—for ransom and leverage against the Empire. They seek reparations for the discarded clone army. 

Back on Tatooine, Obi-Wan has visited the town for supplies and witnesses the Inquisitors smoke out the fugitive Jedi. Reva engages him in the town square and quickly bests him in battle, severing his hand. Obi-Wan, for the first time in years, is moved to act. But he knows he cannot. 

Reva, with her fellow Inquisitors behind her, interrogates the Jedi in front of the crowded square, “WE KNOW ABOUT THE PATH!” The intelligence the Inquisitors seek is about an underground network that helps force-sensitive beings escape the empire. The Jedi is silent—he won’t break. It’s no matter to Reva, who can pry information from people’s minds using the force. But, as she raises her hand, the Jedi—using the last of his energy—uses the force to pull his fallen light saber, ignite it, and impale himself through the back of the chest. A sacrifice.

The three Inquisitors, furious, leave. Obi-Wan heads back into the desert. That night, he has nightmares—flashes of Reva severing the Jedi's hand remind him of his violent final moments with Anakin. The light saber piercing the Jedi's chest conjures images of how he helplessly watched QUI-GON JINN die. He wakes, screaming, “QUI-GON?!” 

A hooded figure stands in his dwelling. Removing his hood, it’s revealed to be Bail Organa—he is desperate and Obi-Wan is his only…option. The Empire is already closely watching him, and he cannot risk involving them in the ransom plot. They’ve become too adept at sensing potential force users and Leia is showing. 

Obi-Wan is terrified. But he knows Bail is right—this is his duty. And, with the sacrifice of the fugitive Jedi freshly seared into his mind, he agrees to help. He recovers his light saber from the sands of Tatooine and heads towards the transport station at Mos Eisley. END. 

CHAPTER TWO

The four CLONE TROOPERS arrive with the kidnapped LEIA on DAIYU—a planet bustling with crime. They’re rough with Leia, but the leader of the outfit doesn’t want her hurt. This was a desperate move, but he’s conflicted. It’s clear he’s keeping the others in check.  

OBI-WAN arrives, and begins his search for Leia, following the same beats of episode two. He’s led to HAJA, still a fake Jedi, and asks him if he’s heard anything about clone troopers and a kidnapping. Haja hasn’t but he knows a former imperial officer who’s now very well connected in the crime world. For a few credits, he’ll bring Obi-Wan to her. 

Elsewhere, at FORTRESS INQUISITORIOUS, REVA and the THIRD BROTHER are arguing over who to blame for their failure on Tatooine. “You both are,” sneers the GRAND INQUISITOR, gliding into the room. Reva and the others kneel. The Grand Inquisitor goes on to inform them that DARTH VADER will be most disappointed that they failed to turn up anything useful. As Reva attempts to make excuses, the Grand Inquisitor stops her, “You may tell him yourself. He’s on his way.”

LEIA, tied up, is helped to a drink of water by the clone trooper leader, who doesn’t have a name, but she can call him “CT.” She’s still the plucky kid we see in the current series, and we can see that CT is taking a liking to her. We get some exposition about the plight of the clone troopers. His fellow troops interrupt. They’re anxious, antsy, and desperate to know what the next move is. Without CT there, Leia can feel that her life is in real danger. 

Haja takes Obi-Wan deeper into the underworld, where they meet TALA, a former officer turned crime lord. Tala is flanked by ROKEN, her right-hand man. “Why do you look familiar,” he says. Obi-Wan shares vague details of the kidnapping plot, but he won’t reveal his identity or who he’s searching for. This only frustrates Tala, making her suspicious of Obi-Wan’s motivations. As she angrily confronts Haja about wasting her time, Roken interrupts, “I KNEW…YOU’RE…YOU’RE GENERAL KENOBI!” 

Tala has heard the name—the legend—before, but she remains deeply suspicious. Roken disappears. The crashing of boxes and canisters can be heard. He quickly returns with something. Giving it to Tala, she outstretches her hand. It’s a communicator, and Obi-Wan’s distorted, crackling image appears warning Jedi to stay away from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Taken aback, Obi-Wan asks, “Ho..how do you have that?”

The argument between CT and the other clone troopers is at a boiling point. They accuse CT of not having a plan beyond the kidnapping. “What if that elitist senator won’t pay the ransom?! Then what?!” Leia’s heart races—fear. CT tries to bring down the tension by asking for more time. “I bet if we send Organa her little finger, he’ll speed things up!” He lunges toward Leia, and before CT can react to defend, Leia screams, “DON’T TOUCH ME!”

The clone trooper stops, frozen, before muttering, “I won’t touch her.”  Mere blocks away, Obi-Wan clutches his chest. 

Back in the clone trooper hideout, the stunned trooper grabs his head and slumps into a nearby chair. CT and the other troopers stand in stunned silence. “SH…SHE HAS POWERS,” stammers one of the troopers. CT looks deeply into Leia’s eyes. The other trooper chimes in, almost laughing, “DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EMPIRE PAYS FOR INFORMATION ON THESE PEOPLE, LET ALONE THE PEOPLE!” CT, still looking at Leia, puts his hand on his holstered blaster. “Do you know what they do to these people,” CT says coldly. 

The force-stunned trooper finally rises from his chair, and together, the three troopers aim their weapons at CT. “The plan was never to hurt the child,” says CT. “We wouldn’t be hurting her,” one retorts. CT gives one last plea to reason, “There’s still a chance we walk away from this rich.”  

“Sorry, chief, I’d much rather go with the guarantee.” A barrage of blaster fire unleashes on CT. Without thinking, he flips a metal table, separating him and Leia from the others. “WHAT GOOD WILL A DEAD GIRL DO YOU,” shouts CT. The blaster fire stops. Again, CT’s eyes meet Leia’s, as if to say he’s sorry for what’s next. He begins to undo her restraints. “I TELL YOU WHAT—FREE PASS. LEAVE THE GIRL AND WALK AWAY. NOTHIN’ ON YOUR CONSCIENCE,” yells a trooper. 

CT pops up from behind the table, shocking the troopers who stand opposite. “Like I said, what good will a dead girl do you?” He slowly backs out of the room, holding Leia like a human shield with a blaster to her head. In the hallway, CT shoots the keypad, slamming the door. With Leia, in his arms, he begins to sprint. “I wasn’t going to hurt you,” he wheezes. “I know,” says Leia. “They’ll get through that door…” CT says breathlessly. There’s a large blast. CT continues, “…fast.”

Obi-Wan is still clutching his chest. Tala and Roken are saying something, but he’s not listening. She used the force. She’s in danger. A large blast rings in the near distance. “She’s there,” and Obi-Wan sprints from the chamber. Tala and Roken exchange looks before following in pursuit. Haja—being Haja—does not. 

CT, with Leia under his arms like a loose sack of potatoes, shoots wildly behind him. His former squad mates are catching up. CT can’t outrun them. Ducking down another alley, he spots a fire escape. Shooting the ladder sends it crashing to the ground. “I can’t outrun them,” he says to Leia. “You go up there and you hide.” He sets Leia on the ground, and they share a knowing look. “Go,” he says. A blaster bolt whizzes by his head, “GO NOW!” Leia goes up the ladder. 

Sprinting his way through crowded streets, Obi-Wan hears blaster fire in the distance. Red flashes fill a not-too-distant cross street. Obi-Wan needs to move.  

One of the attacking clone troopers shouts, “SHE’S HEADING FOR THE ROO…” CTs blaster bolt connects with his shoulder, sending him spiraling backward. CT and the remaining two clones exchange gunfire. Another of his shots makes contact—this time fatal—which causes him to feel a moment of anguish. The moment was all the other trooper needed. CT is hit in the chest, sending him to the ground, dead. “NO,” rings from the roof. Leia—honorably, naively—waited to see if CT would be ok.

Obi-Wan hears it as he turns the corner. A clone trooper lays still in the alleyway, while another has almost ascended a ladder to the roof. 

Leia runs, but the trooper is closing in. She hops from rooftop to rooftop until she slides to a halt—the gap to the next roof is too wide. “THAT’S ENOUGH,” he yells, out of breath. “You … are … coming … with me.” Leia, facing the lone trooper, steps backward towards the roof’s edge. “THAT FALL WILL KILL YOU!” Leia, defiantly, shouts, “YOU WILL KILL ME!” She takes another step back. “DON’T BE STUPID,” yells the trooper. “THE FORCE WILL PROTECT ME!” She takes another step back, onto the air, and begins to fall. 

A blaster bolt hits the trooper from behind. As he falls to his knees, Obi-Wan sprints past, throwing the blaster away. His eyes meet Leia’s as her face dips beneath the roofline. He slides, his hand outstretched. He’s far too late to catch her. He keeps his hand outstretched and, for a moment, abandons fear. Because, at this moment, the only thing that matters is the safety of the child he swore to protect. Leia’s body magically slows to a halt in midair, protected by the force, as she believed.

In SPACE, behind glass, a pair of yellow eyes open suddenly. DARTH VADER feels a presence he has not felt in a long, long time. [Spoiler] What I'd change about Obi-Wan"
starwars,"Context: I watched mandalorian as the first star wars product then didn't touch star wars for about a year then I was bored so I watched all 3 trilogies and I forgot everything from mandalorian and don't know anything really. Should I rewatch it to understand book of boba fett?
What i dont understand : I don't understand the time set of the show.Which one is present and which is a flashback.One scene he's in the healing chamber and one scene he's with these overgrown sand people (tusks i think ) and one scene he's in the Jabba town thing and I just can't wrap my head around it. Can anybody tell me what's happening WITHOUT SPOILERS because I'm in episode 3 of the first season. I can't understand tbobf."
starwars,"Am I a bad Star Wars fan because I don’t care about the regular people, I only care about the light and dark space wizards with the light swords? Question?"
starwars,"Sure the dialogue in OBK is cheesy, but that’s what makes it Star Wars. Sure the writing could have been better, but they gave us new characters and they did it pretty well too. The choreography for the fights was amazing, and the CGI in general. I’m super hyped for the finale, I just wish I could open this app without reading something about someone hating it. How hard is it just to enjoy a series jeez"
starwars,We don't have Obi-Wan's chroma key eyeballs or lightsaber reflections anymore. Curved LED scenery ftw. I'm so grateful that Star Wars continues to lead the way in tech ...
starwars,My question is that why didn’t at the beginning that sniper shoot at kenobi but shot at that droid ? Hello guys I just started Star Wars and I’m on episode 2 and I have a question
starwars,"Personally some things that I’d really like is 

A. Towns and side quests- I’m gonna lump these two together since they’d probably be connected. Something that bothered me a little is how some of the worlds felt a little bare when it came to populations. Obviously for the planets they go to they present good reasons for this since imperials would generally have already cleared out any towns you already visited. However, I feel like it made the universe feel somewhat small and like there wasn’t really much within the universe. This would also allow for maybe the introduction of side quests, which would encourage more general exploration of the worlds, outside of finding more ponchos.

B. More Customizations- This ones fairly simple. I’d maybe just like more options to customize Cal’s look outside of PONCHOOOOOOOOOS. Something like maybe armor, or maybe a rebel look? Hopes for Jedi: Survivor?"
starwars, I'm trying to make some story coms. They're $10 a piece. OCs are welcome. I'm not negotiating the price bc my mom needs this money. Please dm me if you are interested. I'm trying to get PayPal set up so the first few coms may take a bit. story coms?
starwars,"So when Kenobi and Leia get back to Tatooine they meet up with Bail and Owen. Obiwan explains to Bail and Owen that the empire is following them and gets Owens permission for Bail to take Luke away from the farm. Obiwan tells Bail where to take Luke and to take Leia back to Aldrean, remember they want them together for as little time as possible.Bail leaves Tatooine with Luke and Leia and we get a quick but sweet scene with the twins together. We see Bail back on Aldrean without Luke and we will learn where he took Luke. We get our fight with Vader and Obiwan on Tatooine and Obiwan escapes. It could even be at the Lars farm and after the fight Vader could have a moment with Shmies grave. After the empire leaves Obiwan goes to bring Luke back to Tatooine. We see him land in Dagobah and we see that Bail took Luke to Yoda. They don’t want Luke to remember the experience with his sister so they use a Jedi mind trick to make him forget the experience. Yes we haven’t seen a mind trick used like that before but I think it’s possible. The trick effects the victims mind and chooses what the victim does. Everyone forgets things so it might be able to make someone forget an experience. They make Luke forget and Obiwan takes him back to Tatooine. This would explain Luke saying there’s something familiar about Dagobah in Empire because some part of his subconscious remembers Obiwan taking him there. Can you use a mind trick to wipe someone’s mind? If yes I have a Kenobi theory that adds more to Empire Strikes Back"
starwars,As in they both have now portrayed a younger version of their character at an older age (McDiarmid in the prequels obviously and now Christensen portraying pre AOTC Anakin in the Obi-Wan series). Just thought this was a cool fun fact! Hayden Christensen now has something in common with his master Ian Mcdiarmid
starwars,"He had such a diverse and successful career. 

To me, that saying it lessens his talent. I cringe every time someone says “He was Obi Wan in Star Wars” when referring to Alec Guinness"
starwars,"I know a lot of people are going to be disappointed but I think Vader is done in the series. In ep 5 it showed that he was still the learner as obi wan tricked him when he lost focus, again. It's time for Reva and Obi wan to have a final conflict involving Luke some how

I'm just saying this because a lot of my friends think Vader's gonna come back in ep 6 and have this amazing duel.     I think their done with it now. Vader's scenes are done in the Kenobi show"
starwars,"I know Season 7 was created six years after the novel was written, so I wasn't sure how the events lined up. Does ""Ahsoka"" (2014 novel) take place before or after The Clone Wars: Season 7?"
starwars,"Idk if this is popular or not but there should be more of Darth Maul. After the phantom menace, clone wars, rebels, and the ending of solo all added to his story and made him in my opinion one of the best Sith and I absolutely want to see more of him. Is there any specific reason Disney won't give him his own movie or series? There should be a Darth Maul series or movie sometime soon"
starwars,"The holocron, belonging to Kanan Jarrus, that Ezra opens in the first season of Rebels is the same holocron that Cere Junda shows Cal Kestis at the beginning of the video game Jedi: Fallen Order. Once opened, both holocrons are the same exact message from Obi-Wan Kenobi. “This is master Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi. I regret to report that both the republc and the Jedi order have fallen.” I don’t believe Obi-Wan would have made multiple holocrons of the same exact message. Therefore, with Rebels taking place roughly 9-10 years after Fallen Order, at some point Cal and/or Cere met, and gave the Obi-Wan message holocron to, Kanan Jarrus.

Rebels Holocron at 0:05 in
https://youtu.be/Jl69hfG3yCY

Fallen Order Holocron at 1:41 in
https://youtu.be/LchcDpJs838

Identical message from Obi-Wan Kenobi in both. Theory: Kanan Jarrus met up with Cal Kestis and/or Cere Junda at some point"
starwars,"I keep hearing 30, but idk if it’s actually that many. It didn’t look like 30. Anyways, here’s who I know survived:

Anakin Skywalker
Padmé Naberrie
Mace Windu
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Agen Kolar
Luminara Unduli
Stass Allie
Bultar Swan
Shaak-Ti
Saesee Tiin
Kit Fisto
Ki-Adi-Mundi

Aayla Secura
And three others that idk the names of.


That adds up to 17. How many Jedi actually survived the Geonosis arena battle?"
starwars,I’m still very upset about how we never got closure on grievous dying. He was my favorite character and I wanna know how his story ends. Anyone else upset about this?
starwars,"My girlfriend just started season 4 of clone wars. I don’t want to spoil anything to come in the show, by watching kenobi with her. Should we binge kenobi tonight with the Finale or wait until she’s finished Clone wars? Clone wars (series) spoilers in kenobi?"
starwars,"Been a Star Wars fan for a while now, but the last couple of years I’ve really gotten into it given all the tv series and movies.
Now I’m looking to expand my knowledge with some comics. I’d want them to be within the current canon.
What would you recommend? Looking for book or comic recommendations."
starwars,I'm noticed since BOBF was released there seems to be a massive dip in writing and directing. What with new Star Wars Shows?
starwars,"If you think about it, the Luke and Leia incident would not be the only time when family members went too close to comfort. In Canon Palpatine created Anakin by impregnating Shmi. So Palps kinda is Anakins father.

Rey is his official granddaughter so they are directly related. And since Anakin is his son, Leia is his granddaughter, too and Kylo is his greatgrandson. So the Love relation they both have (including the kiss in the end) is between granddaughter and greatgrandson. Star Wars has an issue with accidental incest… seriously"
starwars,"I know Yoda was shown teaching younglings, so did all the Jedi masters teach certain “grades” or “levels” of learners? Like was Ki Adi Mundi like a third grade teacher for example? Or did they just all teach everything at every level? Did Jedi instructors have levels similar to grade school in real life?"
starwars,I think Rosario Dawson looks more like Ahsoka without make up than with it Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka
starwars,Sending a pattern here... Leia's green coat a coincidence? The little green one
starwars,"Does anyone know off the top of their head or have a collection of sources describing all the sequel ideas Lucas had? I’ve heard at least 3, the idea with Darth Talon, something about the Whills, and my dad who grew up with the original trilogy always said he claimed there’d be 9 movies and the last 3 were basically going to be about Luke Skywalker’s kids and whatever. From what I’ve seen I think I heard it originally just was going to be “Star Wars” because George and everyone thought it would flop, so he got the novelization ghostwritten or whatever and had Marvel do the comic adaptation and then did the same for “splinter of the mind’s eye” as a spiritual successor in case the movie did fail but once it succeeded that’s when he got the big vision for 9 movies. I’m just interested in finally doing some deep dive research into all the claims he made about how his ultimate vision evolved and would like any help or sources people have already found. All the George Lucas sequel trilogies"
starwars,I think it would be him wrapped in robes trying to make his away around the dodgy places like the uscru district.  This style would be similar to the dark knight with lots of low life crime and him being not as powerful as whoever he faces up against. A mace windu show would be so cool.
starwars,I mean why wasn’t any more powerful with chosen? Why was Darth vader the poster boy for the villain in the Star Wars movies?
starwars,"Seeing a strong black character like Reva in a leading role empowers me more than I knew before watching the Kenobi Series. 

It is almost like the first breath after lying under your covers - you had no idea how much pressure you were under until you get some reprieve. 

Watching all your heros from all your favorite show and movies being something that doesn’t look like you is something you grow up overlooking but it definitely messes with you internally. 

Seeing this on screen almost feels like some validation that you can be as great as others who may look different.

I am so grateful for this show. I am so grateful for Reva"
starwars,"I mean Anakin barely made a sound when his was cut off, and Luke yelled very quickly just out of shock, but Mace Windu’s screaming is just so funny to me because it’s long and drawn out and over-dramatic. You’d think the baddest mafck in the galaxy would barely make a peep. Why did Mace Windu scream like a bitch when his arm was cut off?"
starwars,"In terms of overall production, pacing, dialogue, special effects/cgi, the sequels win hands down… but for the life of me, I just can’t understand why I gravitate more towards the prequels. Sure the prequels have several flaws, but if I had to choose to sit down for 6+ hours and watch either all 3 of the prequel films or all 3 of the sequel films, I’d pick the prequels, with great enthusiasm and a BIG smile on my face. Why? I don’t know really…. Maybe it has something to do with Lucas and his creative genius. With the prequels, although they can be cheesy at times, makes you feel like you are actually watching a Star Wars film. The Disney films just feel like a money grab, even with Hamill, Ford, And Fisher making an appearance. It just doesn’t feel like “home”… am I wrong for thinking that? Is it wrong that I enjoy the prequels more then the sequels?"
starwars,"Sidious absolutely obliterated Maul and Savage with dual wield sabers, (and I fully believe Sidious would have killed Rey within 2 seconds if he had his original body and dual wield sabers).. 

Rey killed the most powerful force user in canon star wars history with dual wield sabers (Excluding the mortis gods). Dual Wield Sabers  &gt; The Force

Kanan defeated the grand inquisitor with dual wield sabers. 

&amp;#x200B;

And when Vader held those two red lightsabers after dominating Reva, he looked pretty badass. I know Vader loves a free hand so he can use the force, but I really think he should have ditched the Force in fights and just became the best dual wield fighter. I think he would have been able to easily deflect Sidious lightning and take his place way before Return of the jedi. Dual wield sabers are the most powerful weapons in Star Wars.. here's why I think so: (contains small Kenobi episode 5 spoiler)"
starwars,"If Disney really cared about SW fan base, they would give more money on to shows and films and maybe SW would be R-rated and lightsabers would work like lightsabers. Look at Rings of power from Amazon, it will be  the most expensive TV show for now and from the leaks, it looks amazing by far and Disney got a lot of money so I dont se where is the problem, they can spent some millions of dollars, the money will come back to them Does Disney even care about Star Wars or is it only about money?"

2. Master of the force, and also teaches how to use the force, except cannot do it consciously

starwars,"*kenobi spoilers ahead

For the longest time it was only two Jedi that made it. Obi Wan and Yoda. Not sure if more, my Star Wars knowledge isn’t the best.

Back then, Order 66 felt like this cataclysmic event that two of the greatest masters of the Order survived. Then came Ahsoka. It makes sense that the Chosen Ones apprentice could make it. Then came grogu and Kanen, then Cal Kestis, the Jedi at the beginning of Kenobi, Reva, and now Gungi.

I completely understand that there were so many Jedi in the galaxy not even including younglings and that some could slip through the cracks. Sidious is the villian and should have imperfections. However it feels every year we get a new Jedi that survived O66, and it feels less impactful. This is a mastermind that was plotting to bring back the Sith from a millennium of hiding in the shadows. I would like to think his ultimate trap would be a little more foolproof.

As for Luke’s story I also understand that both Yoda and Obi wan were only aware of Luke being capable of taking on Vader/The Emperor. However the aspect and stakes of him being the last of the Jedi becomes less pronounced knowing the other Jedi out there. 

Would love to hear this subreddits thoughts down below, thanks! Does more Jedi surviving Order 66 cheapen Sidious/Make Luke less important?"
starwars,"Easy way to trim down Starkiller’s arc is to skip the introduction of Kota and his first few missions. If you like Starkiller as an inquisitor that’s fine, but however you envision his relationship with Vader I think it would kill multiple birds with one stone to have Starkiller discover Windu in a similar state to how he found Kota in the games. Let that be the explanation for where Windu’s been, and let Windu die properly in the end when the Rebellion is formed. Mace Windu should replace Rahm Kota in any Force Unleashed adaptation"

starwars,"The animated Star Wars cartoons like Bad Batch and Clone Wars have looked GREAT and their budgets haven't felt as limited as Kenobi does in a lot of ways. If the show is animated, more locations can be visited, more bad guys can be shown onscreen, more effects can be used....

Samuel L. Jackson is 73. Dude might not be in good shape to believably play a top 2 Jedi of the Prequel Era. Have an animated model do the hard work. 

Also, Mace Windu would be having adventures between ROTS and A New Hope. If he's animated, he can meet people like Boba Fett, the Bad Batch, the Rebels crew, Darth Maul, even Cal Kestis can drop in very easily! I'd rather see an animated Mace Windu cartoon than a live-action show with Samuel L. Jackson"
starwars,"Anakin free fell over 200 meters and landed on a moving speeder. Mace leaped from the top of the coliseum on Geonosis and landed on his feet. Mace was also regarded as one of the most powerful Jedi at that time, behind Yoda. 

I always found it ridiculous that he was considered killed. Jedi Masters aren’t so easily killed. Especially those of Windu’s calibre. 

I hope he’s still alive and a D+ series is made of the Squib Jedi known as Mace Windu is made, with the real Mace Windu appearing to save the squib in a dire situation. Then the two go off on crazy adventures. There’s been some debate about Mace Windu having survived the fall. I will note…"
starwars,"I'm a bit confused how parts of the duel between Vader and Luke are developed in Episode 6.

At a certain scene, Luke grabs his lightsaber with the force and attempts to kill the emperor, but then Vader uses his lightsaber to stop him.

It seems from comics and other media like Vader had intention to betray the Emperor; but even not taking them into attention he goes in the previous movie so far as to tell Luke this 'rule the galaxy as father and son' phrase. So why does he even attempt to block? It seems like Luke had a pretty good shot to kill the Emperor there and then.

The second question is about what happened with the lightsabers. I can understand that Vader's may have been lost from the moment he gets his mechanical arm cut off, but the moment he decides to betray the Emperor... couldn't he have force grabbed his son's lightsaber instead of exposing him like he did? It's a silly way to die, I think he would have had enough time to kill the Emperor given that he was busy cooking Luke.

My last question is about something that also happens in Episode 9. The Emperor mentions that they would turn to the dark side if they strike him down. Why so? Particularly in Episode 6, Luke seems very level headed for the situation, why would he instantly be evil right after stopping this whole thing? I find it really hard to understand. I thought he had come exactly to stop the Emperor. Three questions about the last duel between Vader an Luke"
starwars,"If you could rewrite the timeline of all 9 Star Wars films by adding, keeping, discarding or changing aspects of it what would you create?

For me personally I would just change the main protagonist from Anakin to Obi-Wan in a universe where Qui-Gon wasn't killed and took in Anakin as his padawan. This would make Kenobi feel less important over time leading him into being coaxed by Palpatine to join the dark side and the rest happening like the original movies only it's Obi-Wan Kenobi who becomes a Dark Lord and kills Anakin. Then Leia and Luke in an attempt to avenge their father become Jedi and destroy both evil Kenobi and Palpatine in a 2v2 situation.

The sequels would be about one of the siblings turning to the dark side due to them defeating their opponent in anger and the other one has to stop them. A Republic against an Empire. Alternate Timeline for Star Wars?"

starwars,"Whether it's the Sequel Trilogy, Book of Boba Fett, or Kenobi, fans that have followed Star Wars for decades seem to continuously voice concerns about lore contradictions, mischaracterizations, and trivializations of past events with the release of new content.
  
While the manner of their complaining can sometimes be vitriolic and downright mean-spirited, many of their complaints *do* tend to ring true.
  
Take, for example, the head writer of Kenobi not having watched RoTS, leading to (Kenobi Spoiler) &gt;!Kenobi not knowing that Anakin was still alive, despite knowing Anakin's title of Vader and Vader being a!&lt; [widespread tool of Imperial propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/nc9h6q/how_wellknown_was_vader_throughout_the_empire/gy3z99c?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3).
  
My question is this: in Legends lore, or pre-Disney, did these types of contradictions and inconsistencies occur, and if they did, did they occur as frequently? [Legends] Many of the largest complaints about post-Disney acquisition, live action entries to Star Wars have been concerns about continuity being disregarded or abandoned. Is the general consensus that this doesn't happen in Legends?"
starwars,"I think he would do a great job. How would you feel about a series of the young Mace Windu, played by Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair in Stranger Things)?"
starwars,Seems strange to me that season 1 &amp; 2 soundtracks were released but nor 3 &amp; 4 Does anyone know why the Rebels soundtrack hasn't gotten a proper release?
starwars,"So it's implied, I guess, that Rey learned Force Healing from reading the Sacred Texts she took from Luke. Was the Jedi Order in possession of the Texts, or at least the one that taught Force Healing? Or were they presumed lost? Because if Force Healing was a mere library search away and it was merely a matter of reading, then Anakin would have had no reason to betray the Jedi. The only way I can imagine this could be explained is that Luke found them somehow when the Jedi Order seemingly couldn't and didn't have a record of them, though this would seem silly if they were so sacred. So a question about the Jedi Sacred Texts"

Also, it's incredible how all the descriptions in the books fit the exact appearance of the characters in the movies, I've never seen any other movies that leave out next to nothing from the books! One random thing I thought was cool was that Yoda was supposed to be blue apparently? I know this probably makes me look like an amateur compared to those who grew up with the books and movies, but I have to start somewhere and there's no better place than the very beginning. Are there any specific differences between the books and movies that stuck out to you? I know it's a bit of a throwback, but I've always wondered how in the Empire Strikes Back, Luke can understand Artoo when they're on their way to Dagobah!!"
starwars,"Look, I get it. He’s one bad mothafucker. But we’ve all seen how reviving a popular character completely butchers the impact of their death in the story.

I recently rewatched the Clone Wars and I wonder how big are the Kom‘rk Class Starfighters/Transports really? 
In the Mandalorian the ship looked just a little bit bigger than the Slave 1, but the Wikia says its 60 meters. 
So it has to be double the length of the falcon. But it doesnt look that large in any canon media, more like 30 meters at maximum.
Can you help me out with its size? Mandalorian Gauntlet Sterfighter Size"
starwars,Canonically he always kills people that know that he is Anakin Skywalkers IF they are his underlings so i was wondering if it makes sense that he let's her live all this time. Does it make sense that Vader just lets reva live the whole time?
starwars,"All i would want is the dark side to finally win in the end, that imo would be a perfect end to the trilogy. I wanna hear your thoughts on this! If you could rewrite how the sequels went what would you do? Would you keep it simple or would you make it Complicated?"
starwars,"I just got the invite to buy the TV but the 10% off code didn't auto apply like the LG rep said it would. 

Did anyone get one? Did anyone get the Star Wars TV discount code?"
starwars,"So we can all agree that Vader is an amazing villain, right. He is the premier case study on how to make an intimidating villain.

But like... Is he actually that well written? The man has no motivation in the original trilogy. We never learn why he does the things he does.

In V and VI his goal is to bring his son to the Dark side, but he still doesn't have a reason to be so into the Dark Side. 

Than the prequels came out and gave vader a reason for joining the darkside: save padme. But then padme dies, and it is believed that so did her kids.

And now, it is canon that vader doesn't have a motivation.

Now, its not that hard to extrapolate a motivation from the prequels. Maybe he wants revenge on the jedi he lost faith in, on Obi wan who has caused him so much pain, on Sidious who is started the chain of dominoes ruined his life.

But good writing shouldn't leave your audience trying to make it work. Its either in the story, or its not canon. Thought piece on Vader"
starwars,"Vivien Lyra Blair is killing it, I think that's a pretty common opinion.

But I'm really appreciating the writing that she is bringing to life.

We are seeing a Leia that we haven't before, but completely supports Carrie Fisher's Leia.

We are seeing her ability to read people, her mental strength, her will, her keen eye.

The Leia in Obi-Wan makes me see even more in General Organa Solo.  It helps me see why she went from Princess to leader of the Rebellion: not just because of what her name was, but because of her talents and strengths.

I think this is a fantastic execution of ""seeing the protagonist as a child"" because it helps me understand the adult character better.

Young Anakin didn't really develop adult Anakin very much.  But I know and appreciate Leia better because of young Leia. [spoiler] The show Obi-Wan has made me appreciate Leia so much more"
starwars,From watching Kenobi it’s obvious that the grand inquisitor and Reva all know that Leia is the “daughter” of Bail Organa (or so they think. But did they ever report to Vader that they used her to draw Obi Wan out of hiding? If so did they tell Vader who she is? Or did they simply leave out the kidnapping/identity of the kidnapped child in their reports? Does Vader know Reva used Leia Organa to draw out Kenobi?
starwars,"I feel sorry for the actress as I do believe her acting is solid but the writers have let her down with Reva's backstory being badly written. 

1) Reva gets stabbed by Anakin with a lightsaber as a youngling and survives. How ?? The writers do not know how lightsabers work. DO not tell me it was her due to her anger because as she was so young, she pretty much sucked at using the force.

2) Reva is angry at Obi for failing Anakin as a teacher which causes Anakin to turn into Vader etc etc BUT instead a deciding to be a jedi and be good, she becomes an inquisitor and starts killing jedi and innocent people just to get revenge ??? Come on ! Really ?? What kind of logic is this ??? REVA is a badly written character"
starwars,"Like yeah, I know the sequel trilogy exists, but those movies don't actually alter the Original Trilogy itself. Meanwhile, this change by George Lucas undercuts the quiet drama of Vader's internal conflict being won out by his good side. Not to mention, it's completely unnecessary. Hot take: Vader shouting NOOOOO before he kills the Emperor ruined the ending of Return of the Jedi far more than anything that subsequent movies did."
starwars,"Vader stops Reva's lightsaber-holding arm in midair. So now that's a thing.

So now, there is nothing stopping Kenobi from switching off the power button on Vader's saber in mid-duel. And by chronological definition, there was nothing stopping Count Dooku from pulling down the pants on Kenobi and Anakin in AOTC.

Using only their warped idea of ""Rule of Cool"", the makers of Kenobi are proceeding to say that nothing matters anymore in any Force-user duel. Let's see Vader bend Kenobi's saber blade 90 degrees next time but fail to catch Obi, because Vader is such a powerful-yet-also-inept bad guy. If nothing so far has suggested to you that the makers of Kenobi don't care about any previous SW logic, remember the last Vader duel..."
starwars,Maybe as an Inquisitor in future movies/shows? How would you feel about a nerfed Galen Marek getting introduced in the canon?
starwars,"I know the Mandalorian and book of Bobafett take place after the OT. But I’m talking about like maybe see rise of the first order, or maybe see a Ben solo show with the knights of ren and snoke finding him, or maybe just a show about babu frick! Does anyone care to see anything from the events after the OT up to the beginning of the ST. Tv show wise or movie wise."

He discovers being a force ghost before anyone else so he must be special right? Just curious. Where does Qui Gon rank among the other Jedi?"
starwars,"My choice would have to be the comic ""Old Wounds"". It introduced the idea of Darth Maul with cybernetic legs returning to get revenge on Obi-wan. IIRC the comic's title is even referenced in the Rebels episode where Obi-wan faces him. 

My second option would be the novel ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"" which first introduced the idea of Kyber Crystals. They worked slightly differently in that book (and were spelled differently), but they've since shown up in countless Star Wars shows, comics, and video games. What's a Star Wars story that is no longer Canon . . . but has greatly influenced the current Canon?"
starwars,"I was pretty young when the prequels came out, so I didn’t really get the chance to fully experience the prequels in the cinema. But I was wondering if people knew throughout the prequels that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, or if it was just theories. It gets pretty obvious throughout Revenge of the Sith, as it’s of course one of the plot lines. I can’t remember if it’s somehow indicated in the two previous movies though. Was it some chocking twist, and where was it first realized who he actually was? I could imagine book readers knew who he was from the start, but I refer to movie watchers only, just like everyone was surprised when Jon Snow got backstabbed, even though the book readers already knew it would happen. As far as I know, Palpatine wasn’t mentioned in the originals, but I’m not sure how secret they tried to keep the fact that Palpatine was darth Sidious. Was it common knowledge before and doing the prequels, that Palpatine was darth Sidious?"
starwars,"So in episode 2, Count Dooku spends a while protecting this little chip that contains the plans for a space station (what would later become the Death Star).

starwars,"Star Wars has never done anything R Rated and I want to see something fresh and have Vader ruthlessly kill Jedi while having the occasional Sheev cameo telling Vader where to go and what Jedi to defeat, I just want to see Vader full badass and while the comics are great, I want to see it live action Hot Take: But I want to see an R Rated Darth Vader series on Disney+"
starwars,Okay so I had quick look on IMDb today regarding the forthcoming show about Cassian Andor and I was astonished to discover that is age rating registered so far stands at TV-MA which in the states is code for mature audiences. Either there’s been a mistake or Disney’s actually trying to push for an R-rated Star Wars story which isn’t like them usually. Not that I wouldn’t say no to the possibility but it I feel like further investigation of this is order if true. Andor age rating.

starwars,"I'd like a show that present us how the New Republic failed.

It  appears the rebelso have tried to make a more federal governement rather than  a centralized one but somewhat failed because  it all holds on the shoulder of strong icons of the Rebellion ( mainly Mon Mothma and Leia Organa). After Mon Mothma died of some sort of cancer and Leia was outcast when it was made public she is the daughter of Vader, the New Republic became virtually headless.

Show Hosnian Prime, so it have more impact when it's destroyed in TFA. Show that the New Republic choose to have a very minimal army and how it cause the Resistance to split away from it.

Show how the republic failed at considering the First Order as a real threat, seeing it as small sect of imperial nostalgic fanatic raiding distant outer-rim planets. Show how the First Order secretely gathered many supporter among the richest in the galaxy and how they manage to gather considerable wealth. Show how some of the last imperials managed to smuggle beyond the outer-rim ships and weapons from the imperial armada to give to the First Order. Give us hints that Snoke is some sort of clone before RoS

Finaly show Luke's new Jedi Temple and how Snoke corrupted Ben Solo. Maybe he was sent to investigate on the First Order and met Snoke there.

I think it will give the political context TFA is lacking. I'd like a movie/series that show the politics that happen during the few years before The Force Awakens."
starwars,"When the sequels first came out, my hubs mentioned it would be so cool if they had Rey become a Gray Jedi, especially considering everything Luke shares in the second sequel movie about the Jedi needing to end. Although maybe she kind of is by the end I guess, the sequels should've taken advantage of adding Gray Jedi permanently into cannon (since it is just mostly in video games and comics) I feel like the sequels would've been the perfect opportunity to have Gray Jedi become cannon cinematically"

starwars,"I hope this hasn't been already asked, but yesterday I rewatched ROTS for the 10000th time and noticed that when Obi Wan and Yoda watch the security holograms of Vader killing younglings, they also see Sidious rename Anakin as Lord Vader, so they know that Vader was Anakin's Sith name

So when years later he heard about this powerful Sith in black suit named Vader, he should have understood immediately that he is Anakin
So why does he get so upset when Reva tells him that Vader is Anakin? question about Obi-Wan's knowledge about Vader"
starwars,"I never really found the change from Anakin to Vader entirely convincing. The Padme storyline was obviously influential but it just didn't seem like enough to me for him to go kill all the younglings.

It makes more sense to me when I think of Anakin as being a slave. He spend all his childhood taking orders and a lot of his adolescence and adulthood under the strict Jedi code. At no point did he ever get to call shots on his life.

So when he's crushing his enemies as Darth Vader, causing destruction how he wants and when he wants, it seems to me that's it's more to do with the fear of being told what to do again to a greater extent than what happened to Padme.

Of course, The Emperor is his superior but it's not the same as it was with the Jedi. It's a lot looser and he was always violent and angry anyway. The Emperor's orders let him lean into things he had to suppress with Obi-Wan. Anakin having been a slave explains more about Vader to me than what happened in ROTS."

basically, is there any reason, aside from plot armour, why malevolence did not have any droid-fighters onboard? It very much had a hangar and vulture-droids can easily magnetise outside of the ship

Yes, I know, that such a big blast would likely disable them, but I don't think that would destroy those droids so it would be useful even at least for delaying them until the ion cannon fires.

The Clone Wars is an animated TV Show that ran for 6 Seasons before it was cancelled. However, the 7th Season was brought to life thanks to Disney and we got a proper ending for the series and a great tie-in into the films.

# 1. Introduction

Star Wars: Rebels offers a more in-depth look at the Rebellion brewing right before the Episode IV: A New Hope, where thousands of rebels joined in an attempt to destroy the tyrannical Empire and its leaders.

The TV Show, while done for kids, provides complex topics that teens and adults alike will find interesting and worth their time. As always, it also expands the lore of the Galaxy and some key characters and planets.

This post will serve as a guide to watch the Rebels episodes in several orders: chronological (with an essentials version), Skywalker Saga and State of the Universe.

*You can check out this post where these orders are explained and listed with other TV Shows and Films!*

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Complete Chronological Order

Star Wars: Rebels (contrary to The Clone Wars) is in chronological order already! This means that each season and episode happens one after the other in the Star Wars Timeline. In any case, here is the list!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Season 1** \- *Episode 1 through 15*
2. **Season 2** \- *Episode 1* *through 22*
3. **Season 3** \- *Episode 1 through 22*
4. **Season 4** \- *Episode 1* *through 15*

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Essential Chronological Order

This one still follows the chronological order but has very specific episodes that are the heart and soul of the TV Show. If for whatever reason you do not want or cannot commit to the whole show, this is your best bet.

*Most seasons have a lot of filler or unimportant episodes except for Season 4. All but one episode from Season 4 are really important and with lots of key events.*

# 4. Skywalker Saga Order

Star Wars: Rebels is focused very little on the Skywalker Family and because of that the list of relevant episodes for the Skywalker Saga order is so small. A lot of content is cut here but it's the most relevant to look into the family and Vader mainly. You can read all about the Skywalker Saga Order in this post.

# 1. Introduction

From films, TV shows, audiobooks, novels and games, the Canon Star Wars has been rapidly growing.

However, the growth has not followed a straight, easy-to-follow chronological line. The films have jumped from prequel to sequel trilogies, while the TV Shows are just places wherever. For Star Wars fans, it's sometimes hard to follow where certain events are happening in the timeline but for newcomers it feels like an impossible thing to do.

I've worked on this post for a few weeks now, mostly because many of my friends have become recently interested in Star Wars and want to know the right order to watch it. It's a bit frustrating not knowing what to answer from the top of my head and I felt it was the right choice to take my time and give them and any other newcomers an easy-to-use guide to watch Star Wars in a way that best suits them.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Complete Release Order

This is very straightforward. The Release Order just gets you the whole Star Wars experience exactly how it was released. This means that you will get to see Episode IV before Episode I, II and III. This is the most watched order because...well Star Wars is still and ongoing franchise and new content is released yearly, which happens chronologically between other content released before.

&amp;#x200B;

1. (1977) Episode IV: A New Hope
2. (1980) Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
3. (1983) Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
4. (1999) Episode I: The Phantom Menace
5. (2002) Episode II: Attack of the Clones
6. (2005) Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
7. (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Film)
8. (2008) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV Show)
9. (2014) Star Wars: Rebels (TV Show)
10. (2015) Episode VII: The Force Awakens
11. (2016) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
12. (2017) Star Wars: Forces of Destiny (TV Show)

20. (2022) Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV Show)

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Essential Release Order

This Order is the same as the one before but cutting a lot of content that is not essential to understand the Star Wars franchise. The content removed from here makes this order a more time-friendly Star Wars experience for those not willing to commit to everything that is out there.

*While this order is a fast way to watch Star Wars and understand what it's about, it does eliminate a lot of content that provide depth to the Universe (Galaxy) in which it happens. You would be missing things and events that while not essential, make Star Wars much more enjoyable.*

# 4. Complete Chronological Order

Star Wars started as a trilogy of films that eventually got expanded with films and TV Shows happening before and after said trilogy. This makes understanding the timeline a bit complicated, particularly for the newcomers. This is Order is for all of you that wish to watch all Star Wars in chronological order!

# 5. Essential Chronological Order

This order is for the ones not ready to commit to all the content offered by the Star Wars Franchise. This means that a lot of content is removed to make a more time-friendly Star Wars experience.

*While this order is a fast way to watch Star Wars and understand what it's about, it does eliminate a lot of content that provide depth to the Universe (Galaxy) in which it happens. You would be missing things and events that while not essential, make Star Wars much more enjoyable.*

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. Skywalker Saga Order

This order was inspired by the so-called *Machete Order*. The focus of this one is on the Skywalker family, primarily Anakin and Luke. To achieve a bigger impact on some of the big reveals, the order does not follow a chronological order or a release order, but a new one that attempts to provide a better narrative experience with the Skywalkers at the center of it all.

*It is important to note that this Order cuts out a lot of content (Films, episodes and complete TV Shows) that does not serve the purpose of enhancing the story of the Skywalker family.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. State of the Galaxy Order

A favorite of mine! This order cuts very little content and has the state of the Galaxy at the center of it all. This means that we focus on the political and social issues that the beings in Star Wars live through and how do major events come to happen. Star Wars, being pretty much a political space drama, flourishes when you make these things the focal points and not just something in the background. In my opinion, it makes it much more interesting.

So, why does this order start on **Rogue One**? Well, I believe Rogue One sets a good base as to what to expect from non-Force Users and the social and political struggles from the Galaxy under the Empire. We manage to get a (terrifying) glimpse of power from Force Users too and the Empire, which makes it a great introduction for **A New Hope.**

You might've noticed that the amount of content between **The Empire Strikes Back** and **Return of the Jedi** is quite large. As said before, the focus is not on the Skywalker Family this time, and the episodes that we see between the 2 films just help expand the understanding of what the Galaxy was going through at the moment, with a worthy culmination on **Episode VI.**

The good thing about this is that we get even more content after that, that takes on different topics that feel relevant to a Galaxy after **Return of the Jedi.**

From there, the State of the Galaxy Order works similarly to the Skywalker Saga but with added content. The most noticeable changes are on the TV Shows, where very little episodes are cut and the ones that stay offer greater depth to the Galaxy.

*As in the Skywalker Saga order, the State of the Galaxy order cuts a bit of content but not as much as the former. This order uses much more episodes from TV Shows, and cuts no films at all. In my opinion, the content that didn't make the cut was just filler.*

# 8. Essential State of the Galaxy Order

This list cuts a lot of content from The Clone Wars and all Rebels for the sake of shortening the total viewing time. If you like the focus of the State of the Galaxy Order but cannot or will not commit to that much time, this might work for you.

starwars,"To anyone who was alive during the original releases or was old enough to process it when they first saw the movies, what were your theories for the clone wars/what were the general ideas in the 70’s/80’s/90’s? What did you think the clone wars were?"
starwars,"By the way it looked, like an undead, rotting, broken  body, wouldn't it be better if  he was using some dark ability of the Force to ""inhabit"" his dead and wounded body (caused by what happend in EP VI) and control it? Some kind of Force ghost but the dark side version of it. Maybe with the help of that machine attached to his back, which prevented the flesh from decomposing faster. That way it's famous quote of the ""unnatural"" capabilities granted by the mastery of the dark side would gain much more weight and meaning, and the concept of it was much cooler than it being just a clone... Why did they chose to make Palpatine a rotting clone in EP IX?"
starwars,"I feel like she would have had way more motivation that was believable.

Already Established that she is torn between light and dark and could have been setup better for the series.

Downvote if you want. This is just my opinion of course. Barris Offee would have made a way more believable Inquisitor in Kenobi (IMO)"
starwars,"I'm a fairly young viewer of Star Wars age-wise so I can't remember those big reveals like the “I am your father” reveal or things in other franchises. However, I genuinely was not expecting to see Ahsoka. I finally got to experience that magic. It was incredible, I quite literally got chills. It was like this moment in the movies where something happens and everyone gasps. I literally audibly gasped. Tomorrow begins my watching of season 2. I just finished Rebels S1 and oh my god"
starwars,"I am working on a ""puzzle"" type thing and part of the puzzle include a ""hint"" which when I first glanced at it, didn't seem to make much sense, but for some reason my brain keeps telling me this has to do with Starwars and the Ewoks.. or Wookies... 

I will deeply apologize because I have only ever seen 1 Starwars movie, even though I know how much they are loved.  I don't have any thing against the movies, it just not my forte, so to speak.

Anyhow, I was wondering if I might be on the right track, so I thought I would ask the people that know best.

Please and thank you in advance.  I will post what I have as the hint just below.

Any possibility?"
starwars,"This may be a ‘hot take’ but I believe Ahsoka is becoming over saturated. 

Maybe this is because I was never as big of a fan of her as she was with other people, which is completely fine. Like what you like, but I feel like she’s everywhere, all the time. 

She was the main character in the Clone Wars. (Apart from maybe Anakin)
Was in Rebels (granted not that much)
Cameos in Mando and TBOBF.
Now she has her own show and is going to be in Tales of the Jedi and probably in Mando S3.

By the time all of that is done, she might have the most screen time out of any character in all Star Wars. (Apart from Anakin and Obi-Wan maybe? Don't fact check that.) 

As for someone who isn’t as big of a fan, it’s starting to becoming annoying imo. I personally believed she should’ve died in Rebels in her fight against Vader but Dave couldn’t bring himself to do it imo.

I know this might downvoted but I’m generally curious if I’m the only one thinking this way. Thanks. Is Ahsoka becoming over saturated?"
starwars,"I just got to start watching Obi-Wan, so I'm a bit late, but wtf did they do to the grand inquisitor.

In rebels, he was this long faced, eerie, terrifying, and cunning presence. Simon Kinberg (producer for Rebels) described the inquisitor: ""He felt real and human, yet also a little creaturely and terrifying and like he could be part of a nightmare""

I cant be the only one who thinks none of that comes across from this round, baby faced inquisitor with face paint. I find absolutely nothing intimidating about the character whatsoever! What did they do to the Grand Inquisitor"

starwars,"I need to catch up and watch the last two Star Wars movies, The Mandalorian, Book of Bobba Fett and Obi Wan.  Any ideas on which I should watch first, second, etc.? Star Wars binge watching, order of viewing recommendations"
starwars,"Been thinking about getting them, since they're like eight bucks on Amazon. I know they won't look as good as the blu rays, or the 4K releases. But I'm just hoping they are at least decent. How do the 2019 Star Wars DVDs hold up?"
starwars,"It's pretty normal to consider Empire the best of the Star Wars films, but I've come to the realization that it's really the *only* Star Wars film I would consider a cinematic masterpiece. I used to work in Hollywood, and as such am a huge film snob, especially when it comes to the technical / craft side of things, so laziness in those aspects can really drop my opinion of a movie or show. 

The [lighting](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/7b/9f/777b9f99ce20c0c6b23b05011c030646.jpg) in *Empire* is [iconic](https://i0.wp.com/www.doblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/starwarsempire14115.jpg). The editing, pacing, and script are perfect. Most scenes are advancing more than one character at the same time. Yoda is a technical achievement. The performances are all great.

Empire is not just peak Star Wars, but peak cinema. Let's roll through other popular Star Wars media and I'll briefly describe what holds them back, in my opinion, from reaching the heights of Empire. 

Before we start, I want to add that I *love* and enjoy many of these movies, but they just aren't firing on all cylinders the way I want them to be in a perfect world. And this isn't an attack on you if you love these films. This is purely my own little meditation on why I always feel vaguely disappointed in Star Wars media after having Empire set the bar.

***A New Hope***: people call the flat lighting iconic, but that's not because it's good, it's just because that's how Star Wars happened to be lit. Lots of hot highlights, and lack of shadows. Choppy editing everywhere; you can tell the stories of how they hacked the film together in ways it wasn't shot for in order to save it are true. 

Performances are super flat and stilted. Obviously the production design, score, world building, and (usually) shot composition are stellar, but it's flaws hold it back technically. 

***Return of the Jedi***: After losing the director and cinematographer from Empire, I think the lighting, performances, and direction all take a hit. Lots of overexposed or muddy shots. The awesome use of colored lighting from Empire is heavily toned down in favor of more boring white light, even in places where a giant white light source doesn't make sense, like the Throne Room.

The Ewok plotline really drags the movie's pace down, as does the Luke / Space / Endor split in how the finale is edited. *Return of the Jedi* has my favorite character moments in the entire franchise, but the lighting especially is a huge downgrade from it's predecessor.

***The Phantom Menace***: Weird cul-de-sac of a story for something launching a new trilogy. Lots of screen time devoted to story lines that don't survive this film. Breaks a lot of implied cannon from the originals that make them more disjointed on a rewatch (like it being implied in the OT that Yoda was Obi-Wan's Master instead of Qui-Gon). 

Most importantly, there aren't any strong themes in the film, which was a pillar of the OT. Those movies had something to say, even if it was a little I'm-14-and-this-is-deep at the end of the day. There's lots of attempts with all the pot shots at capitalism and politicians. But nothing rises to the level of ""fear and anger are the root of all evil"" that 
*Empire* has and ""Redemption can exist, even for the most evil"" that *Jedi* puts forth. 

The proto-digital look and effects have also not aged well. 

***Attack of the Clones***: the direction results in terrible performances, even from an academy award-winning actress. Super awkward and unbelievable romance. The Detective story manages to be both boring and have a ton of unanswered questions (the Jedi literally don't question further who really ordered this army, or find it suspicious that Palatine isn't alarmed at the Jedi having ordered it?).

For a movie that wants to be 1/3 romance, 1/3 detective story, and 1/3 political drama it completely fails at capturing the cinematic essence of any of those genres the way that ANH captures samurai movies and space operas.

Blocked and shot super boringly. 

***Revenge of the Sith***: If the last two movies had been stronger this one might have come out okay, but the weak performances and storytelling of the previous two mean the climax of the relationships here falls pretty flat. I'm not invested enough in Anakin as a hero to care about his fall. The fact that a cartoon retroactively fixes the character work here stays A LOT.

Blocking here is mildly better than the last two but nothing to write home about. 

***The Force Awakens***: The whole thing is a mess. *Awakens* basically reverses the entire climax of *Jedi* by having our heroes be the underdogs again and we are given NOTHING in the way of worldbuilding we can use to contextualize the story. They blow up a planet we have zero reason to care about.  It's a fun romp if it were a standalone generic sci Fi film, but it totally fails on building upon *Jedi* in an interesting way OR setting up a decent set of plot hooks for its own sequels. 

***The Last Jedi***: Probably the most technically competent of the 3. Really cool lighting, blocking, and shot composition. Great editing. The character work and performances between Rei, Ben, and Luke are phenomenal. The decision to rip the rug out from under Rei and make her parents nobodies was the best story choice in the trilogy. 

But it's let way down by the mediocre ship siege plot and the absolutely terrible Casino Blight sequence. 

Rian Johnson was the wrong person to make this movie, and it's an absolute shame he got pinned for the sequel trilogy's failure. There's enough awesome stuff in this film that I think if he has been allowed to just tell his own star wars story disconnected from the Skywalker thread, we would have gotten some truly cool cinema in the setting. But that probably isn't going to happen now. Ah well. 

***The Rise of Skywalker***: Barf. Worse than Season 8 of Game of Thrones. Not a single compelling moment. Fuck this movie and the Bantha it rode in on. I'm not even gonna quote the line because it would just make me angry. 

***Clone Wars: The Animated Series***: Fixes a lot of the character work from the PT, but gets dragged down by a lot of its own filler. At the end of the day, while I love this series, it was a Disney channel animated show. Does not come close to actual cinema excellence like Miyazaki or *Spiderverse*.

***Rebels***: liked it, but it's often even more disney-kiddy than Clone Wars (not a problem per-se, but keeps it from being a technical achievement pacing and story-wise).

Inherits the flat lighting from ANH as a style choice which leaves it a lot more visually uninteresting than *The Clone Wars* in a lot of cases, IMO.

***Rogue One***: Excellent second half dragged down by an absolutely disjointed first half. Ezro's arc with her father is really clumsy and unnecessarily convoluted. 

The movie *looks* phenomenal though, which almost ends up being a bad thing, as every Disney+ show looks worse for trying and failing to copy its lighting and color. 

***The Mandalorian***: Probably gets the closest of new Star Wars, but the Volume leaves the look just a little stilted, and the story has some weird pacing issues. It's not quite a single story, but not quite an episodic Bounty-of-the-week. 

***The Book of Boba Fett***: this show's best episodes are when it's literally airing episodes from another show.

Suffers heavily from Filoni-style action where people are getting shot at by 20 enemies with no cover and somehow only the one person in armor gets hit... on his armor. I guess it's fine in a kids show but it's really distracting in live action. Super lazy, boring and annoying. 

***Kenobi***: Just awful technically. Terrible blocking and shot selection in action scenes. Uneven pacing. The use of the Volume really looks uncanny-valley in this show, which is crazy because *Strange New Worlds* is also currently using it and looks [phenomenal](https://youtu.be/wtU2rHCc25o).

I guess there's more I could cover, like *Solo*, but I'm bored now. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I really hope LucasFilm gets its shit together and tries to make a truly great *film* again rather than continuing to just churn out rushed *content*. Actually Unpopular Opinion: Star Wars has only produced one truly well-crafted cinematic experience, and I've been waiting my entire life for another one."
starwars,"Would you rather a show focus on the Jedi or the Sith in a hypothetical Old Republic show? I'd personally like to see both, but if you could only pick one, which side would be more interesting to you? Which Side of the War Should an Old Republic Show Focus On?"
starwars,"I just finished the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones and according to the timeline, the Clone Wars series is next followed en parallel is Revenge of the Sith.

This series very meaty as it expands greatly the Star Wars universe, is there any advice someone could give me regarding it? Like does it have filler episodes that I could ignore? Any advice about watching the Clone Wars series?"
starwars,"After watching the Obi-Wan series I'm convinced they are truly and utterly beyond useless. We can forgive the original movies because it was a cheesier franchisee back then, but these days they're trying to convey a bit more realism and grittiness and yet they are comically useless to the point where it just lifts me out of the story. Does a character in any series ever make a joke about them being untrained or ineffective? is it basically canon that Stormtroopers are the most useless troops in the galaxy?"
starwars,"It's not often stated that the most devastating wound inflicted on the Galactic Empire occurred right at the start of ANH and it was entirely self inflicted. Palpatine's dissolution of the Imperial Senate was the beginning of the end of the Galactic Empire. The senate allowed the empire to keep a semblance of democratic and administrative legitimacy, without it numerous star systems flocked to the Alliance. Tarkin explains that regional governors would have direct control, which also contributed to the break up of the Empire by allowing for the cultivation of local warlords and renegade Imperial officers taking control of their own regions. The fatal blow dealt to the Galactic Empire was not the destruction of two Death Stars: the dissolution of the Imperial Senate"
starwars,"I mean if there was going to be a show with heavy weatern elements that takes place completely on Tatooine about one man dealing with the local crime factions...

I'll admit I wasn't that impressed by the Legends novel that took this approach with Obi-wan's story, but that's b/c the villain was an evil HOA (Yes really). Drug syndicates and tusken raiders would have been more interesting and tied into his knowledge and actions in ANW. I feel like BOBF stole the story Obi-Wan Kenobi should have had"

starwars,"I was wondering what people thoughts were on the state of Vader physically by 'Rogue One.' At this time, he would have spent his time training to athletic perfection his remaining muscles and becoming used to his cybernetics. Furthermore, I feel repeated Bacta Tank sessions over the last 20 years could explain why he doesn't look nearly as bad in 'Kenobi,' 'Rogue One,' V, and VI. He may even have healed himself using Dark Side techniques Sidious taught him of torturing Force-sensitives and draining their essence. 

What do you think, given the rare glimpses of him we get beneath the suit, and what his Bacta Sessions and Meditation Chamber, life is like during hours wherein he can emerge from his claustrophobia and either float weightless and with his pain eased or at least shed the upper part of his suit and sit or stand? Do you think his castle in Mustafar includes a larger version of the Meditation Chamber--with it's specially hyper-filtered air, optimal acoustics, and light filters for his eyes--wherein he actually had room to walk around and maybe practice his saber technique a bit without the weight of his upper armor and helmet for a limited time? 

If, during these brief respites, given he could if he chose, he decided to occasionally enjoy food and drink (in disciplined moderation, of course)...if all these were available to him every now and then, did he briefly get to feel almost Human for fleeting moments before he returned to utter misery? Vader's Life Outside the Suit and his Physical State by the Original Trilogy era (Kenobi, Rebels, Rogue One)?"

starwars,"I am taking a course called “greatest performances on film”, and I wrote a paper about some of the acting done by Ford and Boyega. 

The prompt said that any papers written about Batman would get a max of a B, but I stopped reading that bullet point there bc I didn’t want to write about that. Well APPARENTLY after that it said and all marvel/dc comics would have an 11% deduction. 

Well, I didn’t ever think of Star Wars as Marvel or DC. Star Wars isn’t part of either the Marvel universe or the DC universe. 

How can I argue that this isn’t part of either dc or marvel? I referenced the original series and the new series (none of the prequels). It isn’t about the comics, it’s about the *movies* idk, help me out pleaseeee 

Tl;dr: how can I argue Star Wars isn’t part of marvel? Is Star Wars marvel?"
starwars,"
In episode 5 of the Obi-Wan series Obi-Wan asks Vader  upon seeing his suited form "" what have you become"" to which Vader responds "" I am what you made me.

Physical
On the surface level this line is basic. Anakin is no longer physically the man he used to be. He is missing limbs burned  ,and needs a life support system to live. He has become a robotic thing of nightmares. More machine, than Man

MentalMentally Anakin is full of rage, the physical plays into things as his pain from his wounds fill him with mental anguish. Add grief of his loss of his family. 

 He also believes that Obi-Wan betrayed him. The one person that was supposed to be there, the one that raised him. This broke Vader’s mind, having your father /brother betray you and leave you for dead would leave wounds you wouldnt heal from.

Spiritual 

He was the chosen one, he turned his back on that. He was going to be a champion of the force but is now a corruption of it. Spiritually he is so far from what he was designed to be and I think that weighs on him. He knows what potential he had. The future he could have had. The future he believe the jedi and Obi-Wan took from him.

So this one line means so much, its heartbreaking. Vader’s line in Obi-Wan "" I am what you made me"" goes 3 layers deep. Physical, Mental and Spiritual and gives us a devastating glimpse into Anakin’s fall."
starwars,"Failing to get revenge on Kenobi and capture Leia. Failed to get what he wanted in Jedi: Fallen order. He was probably going to beat Ahsoka in Rebels until Ezra interfered, which he was able to do only because he failed to kill Ezra and Kanan before. 

So yeah, he's basically just a big loser with a respirator imo. Darth Vader is a loser with a respirator."
starwars,"Leia: How does it work? The Force? What does it feel like?

Obi-Wan: Have you ever been afraid of the dark? How does it feel when you turn on the light?

Leia: I feel safe.

Obi-Wan: Yes, it feels like that.

starwars,"The shows are focusing more on the character arcs which are easy to shoot. Would appreciate some actual battles or skirmishes once in a while. It might just be me, I love The new content we're getting but the lack of Space battles is not encouraging."
starwars,Mine is the celebration at the end of return of the jedi when the force ghosts appear What’s a scene from a star wars film/show that gives you chills?
starwars,"I find that Bariss Offee is one of the most underrated and interesting characters in the series.
I think if Disney wants to keep milking Star Wars for all the money it's worth, Disney should give her a spin-off series, or at least a book.
What do you guys think? I'll be in the comments for discussion. Bariss Offee"
starwars,"Seriously, can we put an automod bot together and start banning these posts? They have no content in them and at best create arguments that further divide an already aggressively undivided community. Popular Opinion: there are no unpopular opinions and we should disallow unpopular opinion threads"
starwars,"For me, the movie *looks* great. Absolutely. The walkers are good. The action is decent. The figure of Luke is fine, what bothers me is that it **is** Luke. If you’d set this in another era of Star Wars and told this story with all new characters, more or less this would have been fine.

For me it was just the treatment of Luke (and a few other bits) that really rubbed me the wrong way. 

If Rian Johnson had made this film, dropped the Star Wars aspects (lightsabers &amp; the force) I think it would have been great The Last Jedi would be a perfectly fine film if it either wasn’t a Star Wars movie or was set in a different era of Star Wars"
starwars,Why don't jedi's just grab a bad guy and just slam them on the ground over and over until they die the force
starwars,"https://youtu.be/x12JRYHuGd8

Hayden says, ""I don't want to give anything away...but DEFINITELY, the loss of Padmé is a massive thing for Vader."" Later, he says ""the loss of Padmé is what's fueling a lot of his anger...I think she is very present in his mindset."" 

In saying that ""he doesn't want to give anything away,"" he kind of does. 

Personally, I'd love to see Natalie as well as Liam (voice) return to their respective roles.

Could this mean something for episode 6? I'm wondering why he said, ""I don't want to give anything away?"" 🤔"
starwars,"I know that this question is being asked for thousand times in this sub but I have to ask something. I haven't seen any of the movies or series but I have played games such as Jedi Fallen Order and Battlefront series. I know about most of the twists and events such as Darth Vader is Anakin and Luke's father, order 66, clone wars, darth maul kills Obi-Wan's master, Anakin cuts Mace Windu's arm off and many other stuff that I can't remember at the moment. So yeah its not like I don't know anything about SW. Should I STILL watch the movies in release order? I wouldn't mind seeing the newer movies before the older ones. Watching order (sorry)"
starwars,"Make Palpatine a Force Ghost. Rather then him being a clone on a hidden planet, have him be a corrupting force on Kylo Ren, slowly trying to posses him and take over the First Order. It doesn't undo Anakins sacrifice, and killing his spirit would help to tie a bow on the entire Skywalker saga. 

You can also include the ""All of the Jedi"" line, and have the Jedi force ghosts help Rey free Kylo from his possession, if I would rather see it that the only way to finally and truly kill the Emperor is to bind his spirit to Kylo's body, meaning he has to sacrifice himself to rid the galaxy of his evil. Don't know if this has been thought of before, but there may have been a way to make RoS better."
starwars,"Other Jedis turned to the dark side, like Dooku and Ben solo, but we obviously don’t know their whys and hows quite like we do with Anakin and what led up to his turn. I always kinda thought that because Ani was not separated from his mom early on like a traditional youngling, he obviously formed an attachment to her. Then he falls in love with Padme and it’s a similar cycle. And we see how Sidious uses Ani’s fear of losing padme to manipulate him. I wonder though what the Jedi think of love. They only say don’t have attachments, fear leads to the DS, etc. But even Obi Wan tells Anakin in ROTS that he loved him. As a soppy girl myself, I don’t see how you can love without becoming attached and fearing losing someone. Surely the Jedi can’t dismiss love all together right? I mean they’re the good guys!! 
I’m curious what bigger fans than me think of this concept. I’ve read hardly any lore and only seen canon films so don’t be rude To the Jedi council: Can you love without attachment?"
starwars,"I bought the Black series dark saber to complete my mando collection, after charging it and playing with it for a night, I knocked it off it’s stand and the little leds broke on the blade only the bottom half turns on. I spent a lot of money on it and I don’t have a warranty, is there a replacement I can get somewhere? I can’t find anything from hasbro (which is kinda shitty) Is there a replacement blade for force FX darksaber?"
starwars,"I’ve seen all the movies and series but I want to start watching the clone wars, can someone please tell me is it in the same universe as the movies? And also what order do I watch it in? The clone wars"
starwars,"Before watching episode 5, I agreed with the criticism that Reva was not a scary character -- just annoying -- and, therefore, boring to watch.

After watching this episode, however, I think the movie directors might have made Reva intentionally not scary. Why? Reva always had good inside of her, despite the fact that she's on the dark side. The good in her has prevented Reva from actually being a terrifying character. She might have tried to be a terrifying figure, but her good side has always prevented her from becoming so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is true. It could just be bad acting. Maybe Reva wasn't meant to be a scary character"
starwars,"It seems like the period of transition between ep 4 and this still leaves things open. 

How in 8 or so years does Obi Wan with a head full of non-receding hair go from that to grey and super short in that time span? And why does he call himself Ben still and he hasn’t heard “obi wan” in a long time in ep 4…? It’s been only 8 years since the events. What during those 8 years changed him? 

In the series to me it seems like he’s starting to leave this “Ben” phase and go back to his “Obi Wan” old self. And in Rogue One Darth Maul comes back… I just wonder maybe season 2 could be around the events of that new Star Wars series “Andor”… Obiwan definitely needs another season…"
starwars,"I thought about how is Star Wars stuck on the Skywalker train for far too long. Suspension is gone. There is only story around the Skywalkers and then other characters living in their world. There is no other happenstance. Stories before great events lead to established plot points and stories after are often meaningless.   


What about we disconnect from that... entirely. What if we introduced an era without context to the saga. A time and place unrecognizable to anything we have seen before. New planets, characters, armies, conflicts, force users, and new spins on the old hero groups. Start clean, episode 4 style. New Star Wars"
starwars,"Vader has some load of autonomy in this show. I don't think The Emperor knows about any of this.

He brings The Emperor solutions, not problems. Kenobi is a show about Darth Vader going after his old micromanager after getting a really hands off boss."
starwars,"Was planning on getting one, does anyone have any suggestions? What is the Best Place to Get a Custom Lightsaber?"
starwars,I’ve just started Obi-Wan (I know a bit late but I like to binge watch) and I don’t understand why the third sister thinks she can beat Obi-Wan? Surely if she dived into the archives she’ll know he was a Jedi master and one of the all time most powerful Jedi’s. Darth Vader wouldn’t have taken him lightly so why would she? She also isn’t properly trained in the way of the force like he was. Where does her over inflated opinion of her strength come from? Even the other inquisitors know he is powerful! Third sister
starwars,Mine is Probably Geonosis What is your favorite Planet?
starwars,"so i saw a post askin people what color lightsaber theyd want, and it got me thinking if i could have any which would it be. and i think my final answer is basically the darksaber but with red around the outside instead of white (and abit thicker of a margin around the edge),

anyway, since the options on the post were really only blue green purple red i got thinkin about the darksaber  (and non default blades) and its got me wondering how much of a difference there was fighting wise:

like for general use against anything but lightsabers its somewhat worse, i mean still better than no lightsaber but because its thinner from the front it means its slightly harder to block projectiles because you are blocking with less surface area, also the handle is flat instead of circular, which is good from like swinging it forward, but for side to side movements it would be abit more annoying. for just tearing apart unarmed people its the same because you dont really need the sharp end. (which kinda gets me wondering why the exist other than just for style or to stand out).


as for fighting other lightsabers, i feel like it shrinks the amount of manoeuvres you can pull off, like if someone offered you in a fight a plank of wood, or a big stick (same size and strength and stick is like a nice stick not a rough uneven stick) youd pick the stick, the plank is gona be harder to use and probably give you blisters, your gona have alot more flexibility in the wrist moving that stick, you gona be able to put more power behind it and your gona be able yo pick it up if u from it alot more easily, also you can point it any way you want, but the darksaber had 4 faces, if your hold it weird and they land a strike on edge it could slide off way more easily

and yeh some people might give the argument that there is only one darksaber but i was recently watching the visions and there are alot of similar lightsabers that are flat like swords and it just gets me wondering what the incentive is behind it and if it was just a stylistic choice by then animators to make it look good.

or maybe im overlooking something idk Lightsaber Blades"
starwars,We've seen characters make bad decisions in Star Wars but sending that recording to Obi-Wan which could easily compromise both Luke and his own daughter is next level. WHY did Bail Organa send that message?!
starwars,Reylo proved it. Change my Mind:If The Original Triolgy came out today people would ship Darth Vader and Luke.
starwars,"Palpatine seems a bit goofy to me. I know Vader was plotting behind his back behind the scenes for a while (ever since Boba told Vader a Skywalker was involved) but let’s say hypothetically that Vader and Sidious’ FaceTime call in Empire Strikes Back was the first time Vader was made aware Luke was his son and is alive. Keeping the Rule of 2 in mind, along with the fact that, you know, anything Padme/Obi-Wan related is going to have a huge emotional investment from Vader, did he seriously NEVER expect Vader to turn on him or what? Any way you slice it, he should’ve seen treachery coming sooner or later when Sidious told him flat out it was his son. I know he wanted Luke to replace Vader, but, like, bro. This is his son. No amount of weakness to electricity, Jedi extermination , or “Dew it” over 20 years was EVER gonna make VADER stay loyal to Sidious after his son was involved. How did Sidious THINK Vader would react to his son being alive?"
starwars,"Hello! Sorry but I was curious are perhaps cluster grenades a thing? I know cluster torpedoes on ships are a thing, but my friend claims there were cluster grenades in KOTOR. Is that true? If it is, are there any images or descriptions of them? I haven't been able to find anything 

Thank you very much! Cluster grenades?"
starwars,"So Anakin and Obi Wan have their battle in Mustafar and Obi Wan leaves Anakin for dead and found by Palps and suited up as Vader as seen in on Star Wars Episode 3. 

Meanwhile... Ahsoka is doing some fighting with and against Clones, I believe, as seen at the end of the Clone Wars animated show. 

On the Clone Wars, they make it seem like Vader showed up at the scene of Ahsoka's presumed death pretty much right away.

But in Obi Wan they make it seem like it has been 10 years since Vader has been out and about. 

Am I missing something? Or can this be clarified for me please? Needing timeline clarity please"
starwars,"When the movie was released, i was really busy so i didn't watch it. I picked up Disney+ this weekend and i have just watched the movie. I really liked the casting and i think it's a solid movie overall. I got what i'm looking for when watching Star Wars which is having fun without the biggest plot hole ever. Were people against the movie because of The Last Jedi or is there something i'm missing? Why was Solo not well recieved again?"
starwars,"I started watching the clone wars a few weeks ago, watching a few episodes at a time when i have the time. i gotta say the first season is kinda a drag. i’ve seen many people say the first season is the hardest to get through.

my question is am i gonna miss anything REALLY important? i’ve been having trouble giving it my full attention and find myself not fully focused and missing some parts. is it important that i just force myself to pay attention though the bore? i just can’t wait to get to season 2 lol. 

I feel like part of my problem is i won’t realize i stopped paying attention, and i look up half way through and can barely tell what’s going on. but yeah idk that’s why i’m here y’all tell me! lol thanks :) Question About Clone Wars"
starwars,"I feel like the Inquisitors are a really good idea in theory but in execution they actually look beyond goofy, even for something like Star Wars. It goes beyond their lightsaber their appearances, matching uniforms, etc., they come off more as comical than a threat Everyone's take on the Inquisitors aesthetic?"
starwars,"I can only think of Ben, Owen and Luke what ordinary names that we use have been used in the Lucas saga?"
starwars,"So, is uncle Owen one of Anakin's half brothers? 

I am just curious about his backstory as Kenobi has made me curious how he knows everything. I know he is more then a random farmer Kenobi picked to take care of Luke.

Anyway, what's his story? Uncle Owen?"
starwars,"It’s obvious after Cpt Phasma was killed Finn had no driving force in this movie or anything cool about him. He had a very bland outfit and I was a bit bored by his character compared to Rey and Ben. 

He didn’t really have a relationship with Leia but I think that if at the start of the movie Leia said a “close family friend” gave her some 501st armour and Finn put it on and modified it it would have made his character much cooler and more interesting.

I think it would show that Leia really did respect him and knew he would get good use out of it.

Now to clear up I don’t think he should have worn it throughout the movie just at the end when Finn and Jannah ride the Orbaks on the Star Destroyer.

Like we haven’t seen Finn in a bit and he comes out fast in the horse in the 501st armour with a small cavalry backing him up.

Also make the horses fast.

I also think it would be bad for the armour not to change I think Finn should really make it his own and I think the three blood stripes would be a cool addition.

Idk thoughts? Finn should have gotten Rex’s clone 501st armour in TROS"
starwars,"Hey so is it just me or was Ashoka Tano in the clone wars Black coded, like whenever I watched the clone wars as a kid I always just thought hey Ashoka is Black just like I am idk if it was just me, Do you think the writers intentionally did this or is it something that the fans just naturally began believing like how a lot of Dragon Ball Z fans will claim piccolo as being black. 

What are your thoughts? Question about Ashoka Tano"
starwars,"The way the show is written it seems like they expect people not to know things about the Star Wars Universe. Things that are fairly common knowledge for anyone who’s already a SW fan. Like the Grand Inquisitor still being alive or that there is no way Reva could kill Vader or Luke. The reason for this is I think they think that this show is gonna be a big entry for a ton of people into Star Wars. That a large majority of people watching this aren’t already big Star Wars fans. But I highly doubt that. This is a type of show that is, or rather should be, targeted towards people who are already fans of the Universe. Why would people who know nothing about Star Wars suddenly watch a show about a pre-established character they know nothing about? I doubt Kenobi is a big draw for those people. I’m confident that most people watching the show already know a thing or two about the Universe, so why treat it like the audience doesn’t know anything? I think the Kenobi writers have mistaken who their main audience is."
starwars,With all of the new canon we have it makes the original trilogy a bit lacklustre. not to say its bad but it didn't have any inquisitors or any mention of any other Jedi like Ashoka or cal nor the ghost crew. so what if the originals were remade to fit in to the Disney cannon better. what would happen what if the originals were remade
starwars,When Luke Skywalker blew up the first death star he probably killed millions of workers and crew members and was probably seen as a terrorist by the Empire after. It you think about it Luke Skywalker was seen as a terrorist in the Empire's eyes😳

starwars,If he still looked like Anakin a lot of people in military would have been like isn't that Anakin. I thought he was a jedi. Being in the suit gave him an air of mystery. how would the republic have reacted to Darth Vader if he didn't get burned.
starwars,"It'd be very interesting to get a broken and angry mace windu with a one track mind, not letting anything get in his way even if it means being the ""bad"" guy. Wants revenge. 

I think this fits the character better than him coming back as an ally to like obiwan and is in touch with Yoda. Just another Jedi who made it out. He was ALWAYS riding the line in the original trilogy. He enjoyed battle and being a warrior a bit too much. His style of combat was incredibly aggressive and used some special lightsaber form that pushes most people to the dark side that he constantly has to keep in check. 

But after everything that happened, maybe he just cannot hold back anymore. He was willing to give up his Jedi code to get the job done before his""death"" while he was being begged not to. 

Don't think it's a stretch that he'd resort to anything to kill Vader and palpatine. 

It'd be fun to watch him go on a war path instead of just like the obiwan show, but mace windu. If they bring back mace windu, he should not be ""good"". Unhinged, angry, whatever it takes."
starwars,"I would like to start watching Star Wars but I can't find anything on the internet about the complete release order(this includes all movies and all tv shows/series ever released) if someone could tell me what it is, I would be very happy :)

starwars,"It was clear and simple in the beginning: survival. Two episodes, he and the tribe help each other survive and they begin to like each other. They were good episodes and I understood them. Then... the tribe is killed and it was politics with the Hutts, then they go away the next episode. Then it was the scooby gang on their rainboe themed speed bikes having trouble with the local gangsters. Then it was Mandalorian season 2.5. Then it was back to the pikes and we get to see Boba resolve an implied grudge he had against the blue man alien (Cad I think his name was). Boba learns to ride a rancor. He keeps his crew mostly in tact, and maybe he even learns some of their names but I am not sure he was even that close to them. So now he and his partner bounty hunter woman are just governing with no apparant purpose or plot on the horizon and nothing accomplished except the elimination of local gangsters who I do not recall ever getting introduced to. The first two episodes of book of boba fett were the best of the bunch."
starwars,I'm not big on a lot of the extended stuff but is there a case or any stories that would suggest Palpatine knew Anakin would lose to Obi Wan? Anakins potential was off the charts. Said to be 2x Palpatine. I was thinking what if he knew Anakin would lose so he allowed it to happen. He wanted Vader to be strong but at full capacity would greatly outweigh his power. So he let Obi Wan cut him down so that he could always have control over him. Any thoughts on this? Did Palpatine know?
starwars,"(Copypasta of my own post because the other sub is dead and I want to discuss my theory)

Everybody says he'd be tried by the New Republic, but we all know Luke would have flown that shuttle ANYWHERE but Endor. 

(I'm going to use Canon for this, because its just easier.)

 Anakin would go into hiding. The entire galaxy knows who Darth Vader is. We all know Vader could fix and even modify his suit with nothing but a box of parts and the Force. Luke would probably harbor his father in the last place people would expect. Tatooine (painfully obvious, but this is Star Wars). Anakin would recuperate in Obi-Wan's old house. Overtime, his suit would change. Not that gaudy white re-paint of Vader's suit (from Infinities), but something simpler, with more functionality. Gone would be the dramatic voice modulator and loud auto-breather, replaced by something quieter. A simple faceplate without anything too obvious. He'd probably heal his Kyber crystal, much like Ahsoka did. And, much like his former Padawan, he wouldn't be a Jedi.
Luke would keep this secret from everyone, but at some point Leia would find out, because she has the Skywalker spidey-sense. Luke and Anakin would have to do some HEFTY explaining, probably with R2 &amp; 3P0's assistance. Anakin Skywalker would have to go into deep exile. Leia wouldn't want him ANYWHERE near her or any children she might have. 

In exile, Anakin becomes a ghost of justice. Entire slave rings would disappear. Tatooine would become a safe haven for freed slaves. A white lightsaber would soon be synonymous with freedom. Ahsoka would eventually find her former master and possibly assist him. Imperial holdouts would dissappear. There wouldn't be a Battle for Jakku because Rax wouldn't survive long enough to initiate it. Sloan might survive, but she'd be haunted by the Ghost of Vader. The Outer Rim would be safer. Sightings of a mysterious cloaked figure would be reported annually on Naboo, near the crypt of Senator Amidala. 

Fast Forward

The New Republic is slightly less corrupt. While similar to Bloodlines, Anakin's secret war on crime would reduce the severity of said corruption. 

Ben Solo might have walked a similar path, but he would have sought his grandfather out against his mother's wishes, and Anakin would have taught his grandson about the dangers of the Dark Side. The Knights of Ren wouldn't be active because Anakin would 10/10 hunted them down.

The First Order wouldn't exist. Anakin knew the location of Exogol. There wouldnt be the wild goose chase of Luke and Lando going after Ochi of Bestoon. One of two things would have happened: Either a small strike team of Jedi and Anakin would defeat the Emperor, OR the New Republic would invade Exogol. The Xystons wouldn't be finished in time.

Anakin would probably die defeating the reborn Palps, saving the galaxy from the return of the Sith.
He'd be entombed on Naboo beside Padme, redeemed. What if Anakin Survived Endor?"
starwars,"Forgive me if this is a long post, I just have a whole bunch of problems with the PT.

Also I was born after the release of the PT, so really if I were to be nostalgic for any trilogy it would be the sequels.

I have seen many people arguing that the prequel trilogy was the best trilogy, and I feel like it's the opposite, I feel like it was the worst. The sequels are close but don't quite hit that low the prequels did. Now before I go into a massive tirade about all the flaws this trilogy has, I am first going to go over the positives, and what I liked, so I don't seem completely negative.

The effects were good, especially by 1999 standards, Revenge Of The Sith's effects were brilliant in most cases, what particularly comes to mind is the detail in the shot where we have a closeup on Grevious's face which looked insanely amazing.

Of course as always, John Williams's score was amazing. Not much to say about that, it's the one thing that never even dipped in quality through all the trilogies.

Darth Maul was a bit underused, but quickly became one of my favorites when I watched The Clone Wars. But that duel in The Phantom Menace was insane, choreography kind of dipped by ROTS, as it looked more like dancing rather than proper dueling, but still exciting.

Ewan McGregor was perfect casting for a younger Obi-Wan and his acting was the best of the entire trilogy. He put emotion into his lines and did the best with what he had.

Of course, Ian McDiarmid was great.

The plot was great, I loved the idea of seeing a trilogy where we see why Vader fell and how Palpatine manipulated the Republic to take it over and form the Empire.

But after all that, you think I would support this trilogy, but now we get into why I feel like this was the worst trilogy.

Lets start with episode 1: Politics isn't the problem, it's how it's handled. Star Wars has always been political, I mean Wars is in the title, but the politics is just boring. There is a way to make politics exciting, but this trilogy did none of that. The plot of this trilogy is that The Republic has introduced taxations on the previously tax-free trade routes, which pisses off the Trade Federation, a corporatist organization, who in response, basically holds Naboo hostage by blockading them. Firstly, why target Naboo specifically? there are plenty other planets who probably voted for that bill that they could attack, so why Naboo? Yes I do know that Palpatine had a role in it, but if they wanted to make it look like this wasn't all pre-planned, why do that specifically? Secondly, they don't explore why the Republic spent so long without taxing them only to just now make that choice, I know it's expanded on in comics where it has something to do with pirates, but if you rely on external material to explain what should be important plot stuff, you're doing something wrong. Thirdly, taxes. I mean, it's taxes. Next, beyond the politics, is cut Jar Jar Binks, the only role he plays is helping them find the Gungans, but that can be easily fixed. and in Attack Of The Clones, just have other Naboo representative vote to give Palpatine more power. Plus why would they give this dumbass a role in Galactic politics? It's insulting to Naboo, and everyone with more than 2 brain cells.

My proposition to fix some of the issues (considering how this isn't a 3 hour dissection of every flaw this trilogy has, this isn't a perfect rewrite idea), is what if The Trade Federation is a group promising military defense and extra representation in the Senate if they allow them to use their planet as a trade and refueling spot, however when one planet (not a member of the Republic which is why they didn't retaliate) refuses to join, the Federation launches their invasion, conquering the planet and forcing them in, Naboo is disgusted and votes to secede but due to their position (close to a very rich planet), the Federation can't afford to lose them and sends a blockade, threatening invasion if they don't rejoin. This gives a reason why they would blockade Naboo of all planets, and is also far more interesting than tax disputes. As for the Jedi, what if they were sent to start secret negotiations with the Gungans to form a military alliance with the people of Naboo due to their knowledge that Naboo won't rejoin the Federation which will force them to launch their invasion. If the conflict lasts long enough, it could start a war. This way we can cut Jar Jar out of the script entirely without losing anything plot-wise. 

Also, forgot to mention the prophecy. This mythical prophecy is basically the only reason Anakin is recruited as a Jedi. Lucas says his intention for this prophecy which is to ""balance the force"" is to see the eradication of the Sith and the dark side. This poses a huge problem, why do the Jedi give a shit about this prophecy when they thought the Sith were already extinct in the first place? They would have thought the force had already been balanced, because they had no idea that Sidious, Maul, or Plagueis existed. My personal interpretation is that balancing the force requires a balance of light and dark, if light has no darkness to counter it, then it's just blinding. The Jedi were so engrossed into the light, they would have been blinded by it. By balancing the light and the dark, not only would the Jedi understand the abilities of the Sith more, giving them a combat advantage, they also wouldn't be blinded by this idea that only the light should exist, giving a more mature twist to the story, as it's no longer about just plain old good vs evil. Overall, 3.5/10

Now on to Episode 2: Holy shit what is this writing?!? I think by this point I have talked about politics enough, so I'll give you the cliff notes version of that for this movie. Basically some Jedi thought that war would start soon, but his beliefs were rejected by the Jedi council, so he secretly went to the cloners on Kamino to commission the construction of a clone army, based on Jango Fett. Ok so first, I imagine requesting a clone army comprised of billions would be extremely expensive, no? Wouldn't at least someone in the financial bureau of the Republic notice a suspicious amount of money being drained anonymously? How would it take like 10 years to discover it? Also, how would he have the authority to just request a clone army for the Republic without any sort of verification that the Republic had authorized him to do this? so if I wanted to (if I lived in the Star Wars universe) could I just walk up and request they make a billion clone soldiers of me for whatever government rules the majority at the time? Also more boring politics where various systems want to secede because only now do they realize the Senate is a corrupt, bureaucratic, mess of a system? How did they not realize this sooner? Any way, on from the politics, to the writing.

I feel this film suffers the most from flawed writing. Things just kind of happen because the plot needs them to, and how the hell did Padme fall for Anakin when he admits to slaughtering an entire village of Tusken Raiders? The romance in this film is as bad as Twilight. 'I want to kill you so bad"" ""But I love you"". Ok maybe not that bad, but it's a close 2nd. I get why Anakin is immature in this movie, but could it be balanced out with us seeing some of his bottled up rage and anger? I almost couldn't believe this was the same character who slaughtered rebels in a hallway in spectacularly brutal fashions, the same guy who choked an officer to death for failing to capture some rebels, the same guy who chopped his own son's hand off so he could fuel his pain and rage, forcing him to join him. What if someone was there to stop Anakin from murdering the Tuskens so it would have him bottle up his anger, so when the emperor came to him in ROTS, it would give him the means to unleash that bottled up anger. Also, a benefit of having a more realistic relationship, is that we would understand why he goes to such extreme measures to save it. Also minor nitpick, when I rewatched this movie, I noticed they eat fruit with silverware. Who does that? Not even oligarchs do that, that's just a waste of silverware. This one was like a 2/10 for me.

Now for what I think most of you have been waiting for Episode 3: The film loaded with minor conveniences but still being a decent movie built on a god awful first two films. This movie was okay. Most of this isn't going to be the typical long connected arguments I had before, but rather minor disconnected things that made the viewing experience worse for me. Obi-wan talks about the times Anakin has rescued him, but all of it is stuff we haven't seen, which I find kind of strange. When Anakin visits Padme, they say there were rumors he'd been killed, which means he was probably away for a while, but Padme is recently pregnant, sooooooo? I wonder what that implies? More examples of bad writing: ""You're so beautiful"" ""Only because I'm so in love"" ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you"" What the hell? Has George Lucas ever been in an actual genuine relationship? Because this is clearly bullshit. Then we move on past a few scenes to Obi-Wan talking about events that we don't know about. A few scenes later after Anakin has been assigned to spy on Palpatine, we see clearly that he distrusts the council, and is beginning to believe they may be on the wrong side, but when Padme says it out loud, he is very pro-Jedi which is weird, considering how the next scene, he becomes kind of anti-Jedi.

So now we move on to the infamous Darth Plagueis scene, or as my mom calls it ""the slow head turns scene"". Judging by the fact that Palpatine calls Plagueis's death a tragedy, and then says he had taught his apprentice everything he knew, which just so happens to be force-healing. Just the thing Anakin needs about now. Basically at this scene any person who somehow hasn't caught on yet will know Palpatine is a Sith lord, so how has Anakin not yet? By the time he officially reveals he is a Sith, Anakin reports him to the Jedi, so we know he isn't a Sith sympathizer yet. After this, Anakin is pissed at Obi-Wan because the council chose him to lead the campaign to capture General Grievous on Utapau, despite it not being Obi-Wan's choice. Why not be mad at the council memebrs who called him inexperienced and then appointed Obi-wan, it's not like he appointed himself, then it would be somewhat reasonable to be mad at him. Also how did general Grievous not hear that varactyl that Obi-Wan was riding? It was pretty loud I'm sure he would hear it. Now we get to Anakin turning to the dark side. I don't give a shit. I don't feel any emotional connection to Anakin so I don't care when he falls, in fact, I'm glad, because Darth Vader is probably my all time favorite villain.

Then on to Order 66. Prior to Clone Wars, I felt no emotion when this scene played. We had no established relationship between the clones and the Jedi, and so we had no reason to feel sad. In the Clone wars however, they took a relatively mediocre and emotionless scene, and turned it into a genuine masterpiece. Now we get to the scene where Obi-Wan tells Padme that Anakin killed younglings, and she doesn't believe it, but she knows he killed kids before, and she was fine with it then, why not now? Maybe because before they were Tusken Raiders and not humans. Also Vader and Obi-Wan's duel feels more choreographed than for example, Qui Gon and Obi-Wan's duel with Maul. It feels more like a dance.

Lastly, the scene where Anakin is burned alive. I want to feel emotion here. I want to tear up and feel sadness and these practically brothers being driven apart and one hating the other. But I don't. I feel nothing. I actually feel glad because now we get to see Vader in suit. and it is one badass suit. Also something I noticed is that we never see Anakin train this entire trilogy, he's not a Mary Sue, at least not on Rey levels, but it's still weird.

Anyways, that took a while. About 4 hours to be exact. If you like the prequels, that's fine. I dislike the movies, not the people who watch them. it doesn't matter if a film is objectively bad, if you like it, you like it, and I doubt this post changes any of that. This was more a method for me to rant all my problems with these movies, rather than an argument to change your mind. Have a good day, or morning, or afternoon, or night. I don't know where you live. Or do I? I feel like the prequels are overpraised now"
starwars,"Jar Jar is not my favorite character by any means, but honestly, he's not that bad. Granted, my feelings changed with the release of The Clone Wars. I did not like the character very much in the prequels, but he was utilized a lot more intelligently in The Clone Wars and fit into that universe a lot more effortlessly when he shared the proverbial stage with other zany animated characters like Ziro the Hutt and that snake-looking dude in Maul's resurrection arc. (I cannot remember his name for the life of me, but y'all know who I'm talking about.)

The arc that finally converted me on Jar Jar Binks and made me like him retroactively was The Disappeared. His interactions with Mace Windu were genuinely amusing to watch and I felt like the idea that they could barely stand to be in each other's presence was *gently* riffing on the fan base's broad dislike of the character. I liked the idea of Jar Jar having a girlfriend as well and began to feel sorry for him because of the way he was treated and written off by everyone else in the story. I mean, the guy can't even catch a break in-universe. I don't know what it was about that arc that finally humanized Jar Jar Binks for me, but goddamn it, it worked. When I re-watch the prequels now, he doesn't bother me at all. Again, he's still not a favorite character of mine by any means, but I accept him as a part of that universe and no longer question his presence in the story.

This doesn't have anything to do with the whole Darth Jar Jar thing. I am well aware of the DJJ ""theory"" and realize that it is clearly just a meme that got out of control, which is still fun to talk about as a speculative thing, but I am honestly just referring to the character of Jar Jar Binks as he is depicted in actual canon material. I'm curious to see how many other people share my point of view on this. ITT: We respect Jar Jar Binks."

starwars,"Its made by EA and it's an RPG strategy game packed with Star Wars characters from across the franchise.  It has over 50 million downloads on Google Play and seems to have a strong community to this day.

Its like those games where everyone has an equal amount of stars they can level up to.  They all have different abilities and fulfill niches, even the ships are in on it which is pretty cool.

Has anyone here played this game? Do you think its good? Has anyone here ever played Galaxy of Heroes?"

starwars,"Do you in a way think  Palpatine was glad he did so there was less of a chance of him turning back into Anakin?

starwars,"In the episode where Boba and Fennec infiltrate Jabba's palace she uses a little drone thing to map out the inside are and point out enemies. Why couldn't she do the same thing with the sarlacc instead of what happened in the show?

A ""Well he probably was disappointed in the duel and wanted a better fight"" or ""He wanted to make obi wan suffer!! he knew they’d face again""

Neither of which are looking like the case.

Q ""How come Anakin and the other Jedi make no mention of Ashoka in ROTS""
A ""They had a lot on their minds""

No, She just didn’t exist yet.

It just seems like half the answers to questions relating to the saga are PURE conjecture.

Another example is the excuse of the force.
A ""How did Maul survive that, I mean falling  thousands of feet and being cut in half?""
Q ""Ahhh he tapped into his hatred, ya see, the force and stuff, the dark side"" Does anyone else get sick of hearing projections/guessing when it comes to a Star Wars question?"
starwars,"Star Wars is a universe with endless amounts of story opportunities. Star Wars as a franchise will never end, and I don't think it should either. As much as I love the content we've been getting in between all the trilogies, I've also wanted to see projects more disconnected from everything we've seen so far. 

Lately people have been saying that they want stories far into the future, while others want stories far in the past, during the Old Republic and the Eternal Empire. 

So, which would you prefer and why? Post Rise of Skywalker? Or Old Republic? Should more projects be made in the Old Republic era or post Rise of Skywalker?"
starwars,"Darth Vader said ""When I left you I was but the learner. Now I am the master"". I am 100% confident that when he said that, he meant, when I became a sith, when I left the jedi, I was learning the dark side and then became a master of it, I was learning the ways of the force and became a master at it, when we stopped being brothers. I highly doubt that Vader is talking about the last time him and Obi Wan last saw each other. Everyone is over-analyzing the line that Darth Vader said to Obi Wan in A New Hope"
starwars,"For starters, I just want to say I in no way am trying to take away from what any of you like or find fun. I’m not entirely sure why I’m even making this. Maybe just to see if anybody agrees with me lol. It really seems like nobody does. I only ever hear positive things about the show. 

One reason I think I don’t enjoy my time watching it is I didn’t grow up with it. Not to say cartoons can’t be enjoyed by adults, because they can, but I believe it’s easier to enjoy them as an adult when you grew up on them. Another reason is the nature of how cartoons progress. For ever 10 episodes, the plot moves an inch. Which makes total sense because it was a Saturday morning cartoon, but again, it’s a bad introduction to it. I find myself growing increasingly bored as I watch it. When I hear others mention they are having trouble getting through the filler of it all, it’s often advised “oh just wait until season 3, it really picks up!”. I don’t want to have to watch half a show to get to the good stuff. 

The show also directly contradicts some of the lore which I’ve grown to appreciate. As I haven’t watched the whole show, I can only go off what I’ve been told, but from my understanding things happen like Maul survives his fight with Obi Wan and Qui Gon. Also Dooku and Anakin apparently meet up and fight several times. Things which just don’t make sense to me. I can understand retconning to a degree, but those are over the line in my opinion. 

Here’s the big killer though. Beyond not being able to get into a cartoon I have no nostalgia for. Beyond the fights with Dooku and the miraculous survival of somebody being cut in half and dropped thousands
of feet down a shaft. The big killer of the whole thing for me is Ashoka. And not necessarily her character, although she is pretty annoying, but the fact she exists at all. Anakin given a Padawan? Are you kidding me? Half the council didn’t trust him, let alone like him. This is by far the most unrealistic part of it all for me. It makes me ignore anything that came from the show. 

Again, I really want to push that I in no way am trying to make anybody feel like they shouldn’t enjoy it. If you love it, I love that you love it. I’m just shedding some of what I feel about it. Personally, when exploring Star Wars and it’s universe, I simply ignore any media based on the show. I feel totally alone in here by disliking The Clone Wars(possible spoilers?)"
starwars,"Okay, idk why I never asked this question in my mind before, but if Palpatine created Vader's suit intentionally to inhibit him, why didn't Vader just go behind his back and upgrade it on his own? He's like a wiz with droids and technology, he built C3PO as a kid. You'd think he would know how to or where to find upgrade his cybernetics and suit so he could be even more mobile. 

There's probably an explanation out there that I don't know, but just a random question that popped into my head LOL Why didn't Vader just go behind Palpatine's back to upgrade his suit?"
starwars,"My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years, and she has never seen a Star Wars movie or expressed any interest in doing so. She doesn’t have anything against them, she just says that they don’t appeal to her. She says that they seem too long and slow-moving for her taste. 

However, she recent told me that I could show her one Star Wars movie and if she liked it she may be open to watching the others. So, fellow Redditors, which movie should I show her to get her hooked? I’ve got one shot to get my wife into Star Wars, which movie do I show her?"
starwars,"It's so popular, and so ingrained in the public consciousness, that I don't think any one offering (or two, or three...) can kill it off.

like when the guard said turbo lazers. hahaha. and the light saber fight with kenobi and vader is hilarious. 

some of the effects are cute. the irregularities and flaws of them. I give them credit for trying things to create such a movie. 
 
I wished they would have carried that whole special feel to other movies made later. there was something so pure about the first 3. 

they were all great. I think esb might be a bit more interesting. I do like them going from the arctic to swamp to cloud city. and the battel with luke and vader. anybody go back to the old movies and notice unique/funny things?"
starwars,"Ok, I've enjoyed Star Wars for a long time, but something has been bothering me for a while about the redemption story for Anakin. 

He's, well, really a terrible person. Setting aside his massacre of the Tuskins for a moment, he decided to massacre his friends and a bunch of toddlers because he was afraid his baby momma to be was going to die and he wanted to learn the ""secret"" of immortality. What was the secret? Well even Palpy didn't know. Anakin chose to trust him, when Palpy had already shown himself to be corrupt and duplicitous. 

So Anakin Skywalker is basically as bad as a school shooter. How does someone like that get redeemed when he throws his boss down an elevator shaft? Vader was dying anyway.

I know many will say that the fear and pain of loss were too much for him. I've suffered the pain and loss of people I loved dying in real life. The reasoning just doesn't ring true to me. 

My $.02. Redemption? Really?"
starwars,Question of the year? Do you think George Lucas is a mediocre screenwriter after the Star Wars prequels trilogy?
starwars,Who is the best looking character in all of Star Wars I need to settle and argument with some people so I’m here to ask y’all’s opinion.
starwars,"I think it would be very cool to see what the Jedi and the Repuplic were like before the Clone Wars. To see young Quigon, Windu and even Dooku hangin out being one with the force. To see what propblems the Repuplic had to deal with at the time and what the earliest strategic moves of Palpetine were. Maybe we could even see Plageuis...

Its not like Disney would ever do that but with Kenobi and Mandalorian the skys the limit. Be pretty cool all I'm saying... Preuquel to the Prequels"
starwars,"Is there a powerful force-wielding character in the Star Wars universe who possesses a power that is comparable to that of Lucy from Elfen Lied?

Lucy from Elfen Lied (graphic warning): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi0cqs-AmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi0cqs-AmQ) Is there a Star War equivalent of Lucy from Elfen Lied?"
starwars,curious how long would it be between death star going boom to hoth when kenobi tells him to goto yoda? timeline between destroying death star to hoth
starwars,"If there is one thing all Star Wars fans agree with, it’s that William’s soundtracks are superb. This would be mine (yes, quite generic haha):

TPM: Duel of the Fates
AOTC: Across the Stars
ROTS: Battle of the Heroes 
ANH: The Last Battle 
ESB: The Asteroid Field 
ROTJ: The Return of the Jedi 
TFA: Rey’s theme
TLJ: Canto Bight
TROS: The Rise of Skywalker (I really hope the version of the main theme that sounds when Lando appears with the galaxy popular fleet were in the soundtrack… that was the best in the theatre for me).

Honorable mentions: Basically a lot of ESB tracks lol: Yoda’s theme, Imperial March, Lando’s palace… 

So… what’s yours? What is your favourite track in each Williams’ Star Wars OST?"
starwars,"Something to think about If all clones were that of Jango Fett, then by Boba Fett’s logic, are all clones technically Mandalorians?"
starwars,"He believed it when Ben said to Luke in Episode IV that Anakin was killed by Vader. So I was happy for him that he wasnt spoiled by the sentence ""I am your father"" which everyone nowadays knows.
Yet, someone straight up spoiled him and said that Anakin is Vader. 
Were about to watch Episode V and I was able to play it cool by telling him that this whole ""Anakin is Vader"" is just a meme and not true. He kinda believed that. I remembered him of Ben saying that Vader killed Anakin..

Any chance there's an online blog or fake wiki entry that says that Anakin was killed by Vader? Would help a lot My little cousin is watching star wars for the first time. Any idea how I can protect him from a the twist at the end of Episode V ?"

9. Rise of Skywalker (-1) After rewatching all main films, this is my personal order:"
starwars,"I've never watched Star Wars but lately I've been thinking of watching, I of course have heard much about it but main reason why I kinda don't wanna watch them all is because I hear so much bad stuff about the newer ones and even some of the older ones but mainly the new ones like ""The Force Awakens"", ""The Last Jedi"", and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" so I thought I should ask if it's even worth getting into if some of the stuff isn't that good? I've never watched Star Wars"
starwars,So I want to watch the Book Of Boba Fett but ive heard it completely ruins the character of Boba Fett. Is this true? Is it worth watching at all? Is the Book Of Boba Fett worth watching?
starwars,"After watching everything star wars related for the last 20 years I just can’t seem to care about the latest obi wan and boba fett series. Not only is the writing awful in both. The cgi looks bad, the story is boring. Plot twists like (spoiler) the grand inquisitor are so unenjoyable. Or the scene in which leia is running away from the bounty hunters. It looked absolutely embarrassing for a franchise like Star Wars. I feel like this will be an unpopular opinion in this sub but does anybody share this feeling with me? Honest discussion about the Disney plus series"
starwars,But am I the only one who thinks that episode 3 Vader suit is the best looking Vader armor. Something abt it looks better than the rest to me. Or maybe im a lunatic Maybe an unpopular opinion
starwars,"The original trilogy were great movies but they still have their own flaws ROTJ being the worst offender, so if disney decided to reboot the trilogy (making an alternate universe) what are the things that they should change? If disney decided to reboot the original trilogy what are the plot issues that they should fixed?"
starwars,"Even though fallen order is a video game, the plot, screenwriting of the cutscenes, acting, and musical score are SO much closer to hitting the “STAR WARS” mark than any of this lackluster Disney Plus content. 


Even my dad (a massive SW fan as a child in the 80s) was watching the game and said the same. He hates all the new content. 

So obviously that game did something right. 

And as previously mentioned, Fallen Order had the most John Williams Esque music so far. Seriously the score of these Disney Plus show are just absolutely awful. They totally miss the mark emotionally. Whoever scored Fallen Order did a bang up Job. Hot take: I have watched every single piece of SW content released by Disney since their acquisition of SW. The best and most impressive content is Fallen Order. By a mile."
starwars,"Grogu is about 8-ish years older than Ashoka. Given that, I would think they would have been in the same creche or would have seen each other sometime during lessons or something. Unless I missed it she doesn't seem to recognize him in the Mandalorian 

So any thoughts on where they were keeping Grogu? Who might have been some of his teachers? How things would have changed if Ashoka did already know Grogu?

(Sorry if anyones already asked, I'm a little late to the party) Thinking more about it wouldn't Ashoka and Grogu have grown-up together in Coruscant?"
starwars,"Curious as to what your personal favorites from the films are, not necessarily the most popular…

Mine are
1. Anakin’s Dark Deeds (no explanation needed) 

2. Rey’s Theme (not a big sequel fan but good lord this an emotional masterpiece everytime I listen)

3. Luke’s theme/Inner city (i can remember listening to this so much i broke the cassette tape as a child) 

Honorable mention: 
Duel of the Fates (Maul appearing as the doors open, then igniting the duel blade with this playing is still one of the cooler SW moments) Top 5 Star Wars themes/tracks?"
starwars,Haven’t ever watched a Star Wars animated show and also don’t recognize the characters. Only watched the 11 movies! Thanks I’m a quite new Star Wars fan. I was wondering if the bad batch is worth watching.
starwars,"Now, y’all might know the answer of this or might not. It may have been explained in a novel or an interview or something, but why did Ben Solo take the name Kylo Ren instead of a “Darth”title? Was he not considered a Sith Lord? The name Kylo Ren"
starwars,"So just had a thought, maybe someone else has had it before. I dunno. Also my Star Wars knowledge is essentially limited to the movies and live action TV shows. Any way....

So there's that old joke about storm troopers having terrible aim. But why did they become bad shots? These guys had no problem slaughtering almost every Jedi, many of whom were quite powerful, and they never seemed to have had any problems with shooting the average peasant or rebel either. Quite clearly they are, or were quite effective soldiers. 

Heck they're such good shots even jedi have to deflect them.

Which brings us to Obi-Wan and his line to Vader. 

&gt; **If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine** 

This has lead to many people over the years asking 'What did he mean by that?' after all he just turned into a ghost who seemed to do nothing but talk.

But we also see Yoda and redeemed Vader also became ghosts in ROTJ and later films. So it makes sense all the slaughtered Jedi were also running around as 'force ghosts' or maybe that should be 'force poltergeists'.

Is it all those force ghosts making them bad shots? Is this what Obi-Wan meant? That it would grant him, and all the other dead force users the ability to be able to go any where any time and get all 'poltergeisty' when needed as they're now quite literally part of a universe spanning supernatural power.

So while these 'ghosts' cannot cut anyone down with a light saber any more, they can manipulate the physical world still on some level as it seems Storm Troopers only get bad aim when a character relevant to the 'light sides' goal of restoring balance is involved.

Luke had all but 5 seconds of jedi training before Obi-Wan kicked it. And he clearly sucked at it during the helmeted Light Saber training bit and he couldn't really do anything 'Jedi' aside from talking to ghosts before meeting Yoda. 

But he was able to 'use the force' and guide a missile down a small hole. Maybe 'Use the force Luke', the force being dead Jedi meant he allowed himself to be used as a conduit for the Jedi to channel their power through and it was actually Obi and friends who put the missile where it needed to be. After all, looking at all the other, I imagine experienced, rebel X-wing pilots that got slaughtered pretty easily. So again Storm Troopers are not bad shots, and Vader was meant to be some Top Gun Maverick of his universe and even he couldn't hit Luke's ship that was flying in a straight line down a walled trench. pretty much a fish in a barrel. Luke who until like a day or two ago had zero Fighter pilot experience. Heck had this backwater farm boy even flown a real ship before then?

Even when he first gets to Dagobah, he seems to have zero 'force' anything aside from seeing and talking to dead people. He cannot even lift a small rock with the power. Only explanation I can think of is Obi-Wan and friends watching his back until Luke gits gud.

All the movies I feel reinforce this. As long as you're part of the light sides plan you are protected.

Would also explain how Chewbacca made it through the entire franchise as he's been there from the beginning. He's quite clearly not just some smuggler, but a battle hardened war vet. I mean how many battles and encounters with the Empire did he have before he met Han and afterwards?

Maybe he quite literally had a guardian angel Mace Windu or two on his shoulder? Like ghostie Obi-Wan seemed to be always following Luke around.

So yeah, that's my take on Storm Troopers bad aim. They don't suck at shooting at all, it's just a bunch of ghosts messing with them. Obi-Wan 'more powerful' line explains Storm Troopers bad aim."
starwars,I bought it on PS but it crashes everytime I try to load a file. Do the other platforms have that problem too? What have you had a good experience on? Jedi knight Jedi outcast on switch/pc/ps
starwars,"They will be soaring through beggars canyon neck to neck, and at the last second 10 year old Luke will steal the victory by speeding past them in a blur at the finish line shouting ""yipeee!"" Kenobi and Vader should challenge each other to a pod race."
starwars,"Hey so everyone I know watched Star Wars and I really want to get into it, mostly because of all the Disney+ content!

Knowing there’s a new series every few months like Marvel is great.

The problem is, I just don’t get it…..

I adore space stuff, but it’s just so plan and boring. I watched Episode 4 back in 2017, so couldn’t remember a thing. Started again 2 weeks ago. Again very boring but watched it in 3 days. Got through midway on Episode 5 and honestly I fear it. It’s like going to the gym.

What am I missing? Does it get better?"
starwars," Listen most of the star wars fans are older .  The first movie was released 1977 and the prequels where released in 2000ish time frame. 

I think they need to make a real war movie for the older fans like myself who where introduced to the movies around 2000ish time frame and have since matured. 

None of this milkslop for the kids stuff but a like a real war movie with Jedis rated R for violence. 

Give us the siths vs the Jedi  a old republic movie with serious violence.   I’ve seen enough cute women running around and wild plot stuff. We got a female Jedi  I watched the first one. It was ok for kids in my opinion. 

Now since all the fans who watched the prequels and grew up on the clone wars are all older can we get a real war movie? 

Starwars has got so much potential. The universe is massive and they can just make it old Republic and write a brand new story but can we get a serious bad guy mowing down some Jedi with a red saber. 

And a real battle sequence with blood and guts and cannons. 
 I think that’s what the fans who are older want to see brave heart with lightsabers. R rated star wars movie"
