Science Officer's Log, Stardate 12345.67
Thrust through a temporal anomaly while evading a [Gorn destroyer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gorn_destroyer), we found ourselves stranded on Earth in the year 2022, our ship disabled. Forced to use 21st century earth technology to repair our ship, we've decided that we must use contemporary humans to procure needed supplies. In desperation, we've decided our best hope for doing so without revealing ourselves (and thus setting off chaotic ripple effects throughout the space-time continuum) is to anonymously contact the best candidates we can find through a forum/social-media- type website known as 'Reddit'. We've narrowed our prospects down to two 'subreddits', channels on which users discuss specific topics. One is for the 'Star Trek' entertainment franchise on which so much of our own culture is based. The other is the 'subreddit' that discusses another important science-fiction franchise, 'Star Wars'. Using 21st century computer technology and data science approaches we hope to learn as much as possible about these two sub-cultures and decide which group we should contact in order to gain access to the materials we need to repair our ship and, hopefully, return to our own century.


# Examining Removed Posts
## Rates of Removal
There are 3584 Star Trek posts in the data set, of which 39.29% are "[removed]"
There are 3490 Star Wars posts in the data set, of which 16.48% are "[removed]"

Star Trek posts are removed at a higher rate. This raised a question of whether the rules are different on the two subreddits, the moderators are enforcing the rules differently, the posters are violating the rules at different rates, or some combination of these factors

I referenced [this site](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images) and [this site](https://marinegeo.github.io/2018-08-10-adding-images-markdown/) to learn how to add images to markdown files.

**Having examined the most used words in removed posts and the rules of the two subreddits, I believe that the discrepancy in rates of removal results from differences in the two subreddits different rules.** It's certainly possible, maybe even likely, that there are other factors, but an examination of [the rules for the startrek subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/guidelines) and [the rules for the StarWars subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/wiki/rules) is telling. Interestingly, and perhaps tellingly, the Star Wars rules were harder to find while the Star Trek ones were posted at the top of the page.

Subjectively, the Star Trek rules seem more attuned to interpersonal relationships (the first four are 'Be constructive', 'Be welcoming', 'Be honest', and 'Be nice'). None of the overall Star Wars rules speak about interpersonal behavior, though within the rules about 'comments' there is a rule about respecting fellow redditors, which links to [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/cq4yv9/respecting_fellow_redditors_civility_bans_and_you/). This suggests that whether or not Star Trek fans are more likely to violate rules than Star Wars fans are, the moderation rules/moderators of the 'startrek' subreddit go further in enforcing some norms than those of the 'StarWars' subreddit.

Star Wars posts are more likely to consist of just a title and no text in the body. For this reason, I'm going to include title text in my analysis.
