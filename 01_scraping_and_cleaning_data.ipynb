    "# Initial Cleaning\n",
    "I used [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50885228) to guide my work on eliminating duplicates. My rationale is that any duplicate submissions will only overfit the model. This site showed me [a way to use .drop_duplicates](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311003) that preserves specific values that are duplicated. See why, below.\n",
    "\n",
    "While my initial instinct was to delete \"[removed]\" and blank posts, I was curious to see that the 'starwars' subreddit seems to have far more [removed] posts. I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/b3czg1/what_does_removed_mean/) that indicated that \"[removed]\" means that a moderator has taken down the post. It appears that the level of '[removed]' may help indicate if a post is a Star Wars or Star Trek post simply because a higher percentage of them are removed. While I ultimately intend to use 'removed' as a stop word and/or remove those lines from the dataframe, I'm opting to leave those posts in for now so I can explore them further. I'd also like to be able to leave the data of the residual titles in the dataframe for now and intend to examine those, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered carefully whether or not to remove duplicate titles. The argument for keeping is that at least on the StarWars subreddit, [reposting is explicitly forbidden](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/wiki/rules#wiki_read_and_follow_reddiquette), so there's potentially a relationship between repetition and removal. However, as I'm interested in exploring the languaged used in the title's of removed posts and particularly word-counts, I'd rather lose the potential to explore patterns of repetition in favor of not overweighting the words appearing in the titles. On the day that I drew my data, there were 53 repeated Star Trek titles and 83 repeated Star Wars titles. These represent a relatively small number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also became curious to see if the blank 'selftext' rows reflected what appeared to be posts that consisted more-or-less solely of the title. That appears to be the case, so I'm going to keep those in the dataframe, as well. In addition to being able to use the titles, I'll be curious to see if there are discrepancies in how many posts of that type the two subredditors create.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to pull 3500 of both Star Trek and Star Wars posts to ensure that I have at least 1000 of each that have text in their 'selftext', in case I decide to remove the blank and '[removed]' posts in analysis."

      "My family has been out of town for the week so Iâ€™ve had far too much time to think about meaningless fictional subjects. I was thinking about how Jedi younglings come to be. there are a few things I know for sure about the Star Wars universe:\\n\\n1. Force sensitivity is inheritable\\n2. In keeping with this, everybody is always concerned about patronage (ex: \"who is the boy's father?\") in anybody that is strong in the force. This implies that inheritance is the main source force sensitivity.\\n3. Jedi do not form family attachments, and aside from a few of the exceptional people seen on screen are not shown to have children.\\n4. Force sensitive children or taken away from their families at a young age, and nobody seems to mind this.\\n5. Since force sensitive people do not seem to frequently reproduce, eventually you should run out of force sensitive people.\\n\\nSo my thought is this: perhaps there are some well-paid highly force sensitive gigolos that go round from planet to planet knocking up women so that the Jedi council can harvest these force sensitive children with no fuss nor muss. No attachment, a good supply to replenish their own numbers, and no angry family resisting the children being taken away from them.\\n\\nItâ€™s the only thing that makes sense.      1\n",
