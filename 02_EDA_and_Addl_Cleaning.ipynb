    "IMPORTANT NOTE ON METHODOLOGY: It's possible that some portion of the removed posts were removed because they were duplicates of other posts. [The rules for the StarWars subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/wiki/rules) are explicit that you cannot repost material. However, as I'm exploring the language used in these posts, I opted to remove the repeat titles. Admittedly, that means that some of the titles that are analyzed may point towards posts that were removed for repetition, *not* for the content itself, but that's a possibility I decided is preferable to overcounting the words in the repeated titles. On the day that I drew my data, there were 53 repeated Star Trek titles and 83 repeated Star Wars titles. These represent a relatively small number of data points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3584 Star Trek posts in the data set, of which 39.29% are \"[removed]\"\n",
    "There are 3490 Star Wars posts in the data set, of which 16.48% are \"[removed]\"\n",
    "Star Trek posts are removed at a higher rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "**I believe, instead, that the discrepancy in rates of removal results from differences in the two subreddits rules.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I checked [the rules for the startrek subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/guidelines) and [the rules for the StarWars subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/wiki/rules). Interestingly, the Star Wars rules were harder to find while the Star Trek ones were posted at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjectively, the Star Trek rules seem more attuned to interpersonal relationships (the first four are 'Be constructive', 'Be welcoming', 'Be honest', and 'Be nice'). None of the overall Star Wars rules speak about interpersonal behavior, though within the rules about 'comments' there is a rule about respecting fellow redditors, which links to [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/cq4yv9/respecting_fellow_redditors_civility_bans_and_you/). This suggests that whether or not Star Trek fans are more likely to go after a show they don't like or break rules than Star Wars fans are, the moderation rules/moderators of the 'startrek' subreddit go further in enforcing some norms than those of the 'StarWars' subreddit.\n",

    "I found the appearance of Star Trek titles (\"Picard\", \"Enterprise\", and \"Discovery\"), potentially interesting. Were Star Trek fans flaming these shows and getting removed for doing so in a way that was in violation of the subreddit's moderator policies? Instead, it appears that this was simply a product of the higher rate at which Star Trek shows are removed. No titles appear in the Star Trek exclusive comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Star Wars discrepancies were a little more interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the appearance of 'spoilers' among the words appearing more frequently in removed posts than all posts at both the Top 10 and Top 25 level suggests that posting about \"spoilers\" leads to more frequent removal. It's also interesting that [Reva](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Reva), a specific character appears in these lists,  as does ['Sith'](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith?so=search), a group of characters, whereas there are no characters in the Star Trek list. This *might* suggest that Star Wars fans are more likely to discuss specific characters in a way that gets them removed. That said, these are both references that are relevant to a new show (['Obi-Wan Kenobi'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_(TV_series), with Reva being a character on the show, it seems plausible that they're simply being discussed more frequently in posts that include spoilers and are being removed for their spoilers, not because of inflammatory discussion of characters.\n",

    "There seem to be similar patterns in the appearance of Star Trek proper names in the 'All Removed Posts' lists, appearing to correlate to the higher rate of removal on /r/startrek. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a Star Trek fan, it's interesting to see the appearance of 'canon' in the removed posts within the Star Trek analysis. Recent shows have, in the minds of many fans, deviated from 'canon', and some fans have been quite upset by it. It seems plausible that posts about 'canon' may be complaints about violations of 'canon' that have crossed a line into violations of the moderation policies. I find the top 50 word list as awhole very interesting: this is admittedly subjective, but the words seem to reflect poster's desires and a lot of discussion of characters/people. The order of the list in two cases, 'want' 'good' 'characters' and 'make' 'better' is perhaps ironic. Could it be that people are reflecting these desires in ways that are violating the rules for the subreddit?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Star Wars words are also similar, though it's interesting to see the word 'hate' in particular showing up. Otherwise, similar patterns of words that seem plausibly related to spoilers appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable two words in the set are 'ep' and 'want'. They are the only words that appear in successive lists across the whole analysis of these words: in other words, every other word that's in, for example, the top 25 list in any other set must appear in the top 50 of the non-removed posts, thus pushing it out of the discrepancy list when looking at all 50 words in both lists. For example, because 'order' is in the top 25 for removed Star Wars posts but not for the non-removed Star wars posts, it appears in our Top 25 list. It does not appear in the Top 50 list, however, which means that it must appear in the Top 50 list for the non-removed Star Wars posts, and thus doesn't show up as a discrepancy when looking at all 50 words from both lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly because 'ep' is so specific, an abbreviation for 'episode', presumably, I wonder if it's possible that there's a single user or group of users who are inclined to use that abbreviation that also post things that get removed at a higher rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's only one word that appears across all posts that's in both Star Trek and Star Wars: 'want'. This suggests that posts that reflect what a subredditor 'wants' is more likely to violate a subreddit policy regardless of whether it's the Star Trek or Star Wars subreddit. Is it possible that this could be true on subreddits for other entertainment properties? A potential avenue for future exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started to break the lists down to top 10, 11-25, and 26-50, but realized that would not likely be revelatory: 'discovery' ('Star Trek: Discovery') appears in the 26-50 most used words for removed posts, but not for all posts. However, it doesn't appear when comparing the top 50, which suggests that 'discovery' actually appears higher in the non-removed posts than in the removed posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "An examination of the top 10, 25, and 50 words in all posts verifies this. These lists don't reveal any surprises, though they do provide a list to work from for removing potential 'proper name' stop words if we want to examine the language that's not proper names from either show to see what non-show-specific words appear most frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible avenue for modeling is to see it it's possible to predict which posts were removed based on the title. I don't think I'll undertake that on this project, but wanted to flag it."

      "Just finished watching the show. I'm not dissapointed, this is more or less what I expected it to be like. \\n\\n\\nThere was alot of poor writing involved, plot-holes and illogical scenes that I'm sure have been thoroughly discussed. \\n\\n\\nAll I want to say is what a performance by Ewan Mcgregor. Goddamn, when he looked at Split-helm-Vader and his whole expression changed, from focused and determined to bewilderment as if he looked upon the young padawan that he trained, and said ; \"Anakin\" ... I'm not ashamed to say that I choked up, that was an amazing bit of acting and brought up alot of nostalgia. Ewan McGregor as always gives his all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "I’ve seen various discussions on Kenobi’s score, particularly earlier on during the show’s run, but haven’t heard too much since the finale was released.  Most of the reactions to the score have been very negative.  And of course, spoilers for the show are present. \\n\\n*A sidebar before I get into it too much, I just want to mention to not blame the composer for the use or lack of use of existing themes.  The composer is bringing about the desires of the production.  If they wanted existing Star Wars themes to be used, they would have been used.  ESPECIALLY on something like Star Wars, the composer isn’t going to get to just do what they want.  Not to mention, using existing music means getting clearance to do so (again, way outside of the scope of the composer on a production like this).  Not only that, but there were plenty of rumblings about issues behind the scenes for the production of Kenobi, especially regarding the score.  So don’t attack Holt over you not liking the choices that were made; it likely wasn’t ever her choice, and she’s a very competent composer who was in a bad position for this show no matter what.*  \\n\\n&gt;!Back to it.  Up until the finale, no episodes had fully used any of the preexisting Star Wars themes for the series.  Some themes were certainly hinted at, particularly some material having an Imperial or Rebel leaning to them, but the themes were never directly quoted, even when they probably should have been as there were a number of scenes that really would have benefitted from The Force Theme and the Imperial March.  The show has been heavily reliant on the Kenobi theme that Williams wrote for the show, as well as a few new themes written by Holt for the show (Leia, Inquisitors, etc.).  !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!As the time went on, the themes became ever so slightly more present.  The opening of the finale was still going that route, with a modified version of some OT material.  And then we finally got three of the preexisting themes actually quoted fully in the final moments of resoution: Darth Vader’s theme, Leia’s theme, and the Force Theme.  This finally shows that their omission wasn’t somehow a glaring issue that had been overlooked, rather, a conscious choice.  !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I can generally understand the justification for why we get them when we do.  We get Vader’s theme once he’s truly, fully, become Vader.  He’s no longer consumed by Kenobi, the last thing tying him to Anakin.  We get Leia’s theme when Kenobi finally sees her as more than just a little girl, but as the Princess Leia Organa.  And the Force theme is used when Kenobi has truly accepted his use of the force and realized he doesn’t need to be cutting himself off from it.  He finally means it when he says “may the force be with you”, and his ties to the force have finally been deepened instead of lessened.  !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!The impact of those themes in those moments was very strong, especially because of the lack of them previously.  It’s a bold move, especially for Star Wars, to take this approach.  I’m honestly still on the fence about if I really like it.  I’m a HUGE fan of the overly-thematic approach that Star Wars usually has and it’s truly my first love within film music.  A huge part of me wishes that the show had been using all of the legacy Star Wars themes from the outset and stuck to a John Williams-esque style of writing throughout.  But a part of me also appreciates that they’re trying new things and are working to move past being merely one version of Star Wars.  The future of Star Wars only exists if they’re willing to go outside the box and tell new stories in new ways in the universe, and this is a small part of that.  !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Really, my biggest issues with the series are just that they didn’t bring in more legacy themes in the final episode specifically.  Qui-Gon’s theme should have appeared when he did.  Palpatine’s theme probably should have been used when he had his moment.  I would have loved a light, childlike, woodwind rendition of the main theme/Luke’s theme when Obi-Wan and Luke formally meet.  !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!The most grievous omission was not using Anakin vs. Obi-Wan when they dueled in this episode.  I’ve seen some fantastic edits of the scene on this subreddit and that’s what I wish we had gotten.  Had that moment been the first time we got preexisting themes in their fullness…the impact of that could honestly not be overstated.  It would have been phenomenal.  Instead we got a very mediocre piece that has faint echoes of the ideas in Anakin vs. Obi-wan, which was disappointing.  In that moment it should have been all or nothing…having gone the silent route would have been better than what we got.  !&lt;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;!I’ve really only heard discourse around the score prior to the finale, and like I said, it was mostly negative.  I’m really curious about people’s thoughts now that their approach has been fully revealed and makes sense.  Do you like that they pushed back the use of the themes until the end?  Do you wish they hadn’t used any of them?  Did you want more of them in the end, like I did?  !&lt;       1\n",
      "I, like everyone else, loved the split mask scene with Vader in the Kenobi finale. However, canonically, Vader's vocal cords are meant to be nearly useless, and as such his real voice is supposed to be a whisper. Hearing James Earl Jones's voice mixed with Hayden's was a treat, but it does raise some questions about the extent of Vader's injuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

    "I used the dataframe that I developed that combines titles and text into a single column for analysis. Now, though, I'm going to remove proper names I found were used frequently by adding to the stopwords. This includes removing \"star\" (most frequent word), \"trek\", and \"wars\" because they appear so frequently and are from the titles of these franchises. Also: 'force' (The Force). I also removed 'strange' because it's in the title of 'strange new worlds', though I've left in 'new' and 'worlds', which is a debatable decision. I've left 'order' in (i.e. not included it in my new stop words), though that may be a reference to the 'Sith Order' in Star Wars.\n",
